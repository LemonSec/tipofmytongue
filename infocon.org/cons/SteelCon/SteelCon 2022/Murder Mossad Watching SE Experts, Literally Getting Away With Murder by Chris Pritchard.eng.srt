1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,279
good morning how is everybody

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,519
any hangovers in the room

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,800
hey

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
good oh there's a half hanger is that a

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
half hangover or

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
cool okay

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,800
uh

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,240
my name is chris

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,320
and uh i am an adversarial engineer i

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,160
didn't make up that job title it's a

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,680
very american

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
job title and i work for an american

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,439
company it basically means i'm a red

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
teamer

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,960
i have been working in pen testing for

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,879
uh

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
too many years i think it's about eight

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,960
it's it's before that i was in the blue

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
team

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,600
um

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
i do a lot of social engineering

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
and

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
i saw some stuff that i thought was

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,160
quite interesting and this is exactly

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
what the talk is going to be about

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
now

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,120
this is

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
about a murder

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
there's no murder mystery this is a

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,199
genuine real murder that happened in

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,720
2010

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
in dubai

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,600
and

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,159
what was really interesting is it was

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,960
captured on cctv

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,479
and so i'm going to

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,320
show you about the murder i'm not going

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
to focus very much on the murder because

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
murder is bad obviously

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
and i'm not a murderer myself i don't

41
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
advocate murdering either so i'm going

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,439
to stay away from that and i'm just

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
going to focus on the social engineering

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
techniques but

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,320
the social engineering techniques that

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,520
they used were so good that they

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,039
literally got away with murder

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,200
now when i talk about social engineering

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
uh one of the things that often comes up

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
in the questions afterwards or in the

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,799
hallway and things like that is how can

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,399
i get into social engineering how can i

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,360
do it

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,399
and

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
it's really difficult in fairness um in

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,560
uh

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
one of my previous jobs i was really

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,479
lucky and i had two people who were

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
interested in social engineering come

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
out on a job with me

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
and shadow and learn what i did now that

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
was fantastic but it's quite rare

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
so

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
the other thing that you can do is

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,879
obviously go to training classes and

66
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,840
learn and study and things like that or

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
as we can do here we're lucky enough to

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
be able to watch it in the wild

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,680
which is quite quite rare

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
and as i said shadowing someone can be

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
difficult because um you know it's a

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
high stress

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,959
tension type situation when you're

74
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,879
trying to get into something that you

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,640
shouldn't really be getting into so it's

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
quite difficult shadowing

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
but it is possible to do

78
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
not many people get the opportunity so

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
you know it's it's it's good

80
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,319
so

81
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,200
as i mentioned i found some cctv footage

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
which might help

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,040
uh and i'm trying to pick out just the

84
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,560
social engineering techniques as i

85
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,879
mentioned

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
i was lucky enough to be here in 2018

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
and i

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
did a talk about the basics of social

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
engineering which might also help now

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,599
i'm going to reference that talk in here

91
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,080
but you don't need to have seen it to

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,200
know what i'm talking about because i'm

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
going to explain all the things i

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,280
mentioned in there but recommend you go

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,959
and watch it after this and i'm also

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,599
going to link at the end to the full

97
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,799
cctv video because i've cut bits out but

98
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,720
also also worth watching that as well

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
now intelligence services by their very

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,959
nature tend to be quite secretive

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,720
oddly enough because if they weren't

102
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
they probably wouldn't be very good so

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
we're quite lucky i think in some way to

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,319
be able to see this um this this footage

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,599
uh i know and i my eyes lit up uh when i

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,319
found it on youtube because it's it's

107
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
very very rare that we get to see

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
intelligence services doing their job

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,239
which yeah i think is uh fantastic for

110
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
us and we're very lucky in that respect

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,640
um so in january uh 2010 a 11 person i'm

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,879
saying suspected here

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,640
uh because it's not been proved that it

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,519
was mossad although it highly likely was

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
they murdered a guy called mahmoud

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
in a hotel in the united arab emirates

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,639
and supposedly mahmoud was a

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,280
hamas leader

119
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
now this is really risky

120
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
really risky because at the time

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
israel and most arab countries including

122
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
the uae were technically enemies

123
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,639
they weren't a war as such but they were

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,639
enemies there was no embassy there so

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,400
there was no local empty support

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
anything that was israeli at the time

127
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
was banned from the uae

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,280
and any

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,800
newspapers or books that had mention of

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
anything israeli in them

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
had big black marks through them

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
somebody's job was literally to look

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
through anything that came into the

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,479
country and scour it and go has it got

135
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,320
anything israeli you mentioned on it oh

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
yeah right big back marker pen

137
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,479
let's crash it out

138
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
coca-cola was banned in the uae because

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,560
it was potentially made in israel that

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
is how

141
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
sour the relationship was at the time so

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
for a 11 man or 11 person team to come

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,680
in to a foreign country like this was

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
very very risky very very high risk

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
operation

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,560
now

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
it was obviously a very very skilled

148
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
team and we're going to see that on the

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
and the video and they left very very

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
little trace that they were there

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
but also

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,160
and this is something you can ponder

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
about and you can ponder about if you go

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
and watch the video as well

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,080
when they left the sus or the victim's

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
room

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
it was

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
double locked and chained from the

159
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
inside

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
i have no idea how they did that no idea

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
so they must have been bloody good at

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
what they do

163
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,919
and then uh dubai police they've

164
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
published the footage

165
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,960
and um it follows the the entire footage

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
follows their entry into the country

167
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
shows them coming into the airport

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
checking through airport security and

169
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,440
things like that it shows them getting

170
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
taxis to and from various different

171
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,759
hotels i am not going to show that

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,039
because it isn't actually very

173
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,479
interesting in terms of social

174
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
engineering there is lots of trade craft

175
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,400
to be seen there and if you want to go

176
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
and watch it then i'll link the video at

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
the end um but

178
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
it's i think it's a

179
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,880
20 minute video

180
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,319
and there's lots of other stuff in there

181
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,840
that is interesting so definitely going

182
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,799
worth watching it

183
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
now i do have to apologize the cct

184
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,960
footage is awful it is really really

185
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,319
rubbish quality uh and if there are any

186
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
cissps out there take notes see cctv is

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,639
not quite as good as we think it is um

188
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
and it doesn't it hasn't really helped

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
in terms of being able to solve the

190
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
crime here because the footage is so

191
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,960
poor they've had to rely on passport

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
photos when they came through airport

193
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,680
security to identify the the uh 11

194
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,960
person team

195
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,319
that is how poor the cctv footage is so

196
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
if you are uh planning on putting cctv

197
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
in anywhere think about the quality and

198
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,599
think about how it's going to work for

199
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,199
you because in this instance it is

200
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,160
terrible

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
and i'm making that apology now because

202
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
when it comes on a big screen like this

203
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,199
it's going to look rubbish and i'm sorry

204
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,960
for that i couldn't do anything about it

205
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,639
i'm also going to jump around the

206
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,479
timeline of events because i'm

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
interested in the sc techniques i'm not

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,720
interested in the murder so when you go

209
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
and watch the video yourself you'll see

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,599
that i've taken various bits and they've

211
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
jumped around that's fine i'm not

212
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,599
interested in the murder don't want it i

213
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,440
don't want to know about it really um

214
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,800
but i am interested in showing you

215
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,919
social engineering techniques

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
i'm also going to jump to the point

217
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,759
where the suspects have already entered

218
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,120
the country

219
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
and are moving between various hotels

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
because how they got through air force

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,560
security and stuff like that

222
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
is available all the information about

223
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,360
that is available if you want to go and

224
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,879
read about it i suggest you do it's

225
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,720
quite interesting

226
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
but basically they had dual nationality

227
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,599
passports

228
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,840
so uh when you read up about it there

229
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
was they were israelis but they also had

230
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,559
british passports irish passports german

231
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,679
passports and stuff like that

232
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,120
and what i've done essentially is i've

233
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
taken all of this footage and i've just

234
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,800
highlighted the smaller se techniques

235
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
now

236
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
as a social engineer

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,800
when we are tasked with a job and

238
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
whether that's getting into you know a

239
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
casino

240
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,279
an airport etc the first thing that we

241
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,399
do

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
is reconnaissance

243
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
because we want to know what we're

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,959
facing

245
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,320
what are we looking at what are the

246
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,519
people dressed like

247
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
are they wearing id badges like this for

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
example all that sort of stuff for a

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,800
social engineer is really really

250
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
important and really interesting and

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
it helps us

252
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
get in and i'll explain that in a bit

253
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
so let's set the scene here um dubai is

254
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
oversea in the united arab emirates or

255
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,560
the uae

256
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,959
uh it is a business and a tourist

257
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,680
destination i'm going to make that clear

258
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,040
because most of the people that we see

259
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
in the footage are dressed in business

260
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
sense but there are some tourists there

261
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
we all know about the palm and all that

262
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
sort of stuff that's been there recently

263
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,519
probably within the last seven years or

264
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,320
so

265
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
but dubai brought built their first

266
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
green grass golf course

267
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,959
back in the late 90s and it has been

268
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,040
trying to become a tourist destination

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,399
since the 90s

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
so that's an important thing to note

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,279
now bearing in mind this was in 2010

272
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,880
things that were happening the bad stuff

273
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
that was happening in iraq was still

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
happening and so lots of military

275
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
contractors that were in iraq were

276
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
coming to dubai

277
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
to relax as like r r uh at the weekends

278
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,440
or whenever they had any time off and

279
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
part of the reason for that is as you

280
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
probably know

281
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
most arabic countries ban alcohol

282
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
even in hotels apart from the uae in the

283
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,920
uae you are allowed to drink alcohol in

284
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
a hotel

285
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,839
so lots of military contractors go there

286
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,320
to take a break

287
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,440
most of the footage i'm going to show is

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,399
from inside the hotels

289
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,600
and i'm going to show you some pictures

290
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,279
of how the hotel is structured and laid

291
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,320
out because i think that's useful

292
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,800
information as well

293
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,839
and

294
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,839
another important thing to note is that

295
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,240
in dubai and in fact most of the uae

296
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
there are no

297
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,240
um

298
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
sports facilities there's no like public

299
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
swimming pools for example there's no

300
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
public tennis courts and things like

301
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,800
that

302
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
if you want to go swimming or if you

303
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,519
want to go to a beach you pay a monthly

304
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,920
subscription to a hotel and you go and

305
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
use their facilities

306
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,320
um

307
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
so

308
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,279
if you want to go swimming you pay the

309
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,200
hotel and you just it's like a gym it's

310
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
like we think of a gym over here it's

311
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,920
the same kind of facility over there so

312
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
everything sports facility wise is going

313
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,279
to be in a hotel and do by residents

314
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
basically pay a monthly fee and choose

315
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
which hotel they want to go to and use

316
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,279
those sports facilities and if they've

317
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,040
got better squash courts in one or

318
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,519
another that's the one they go to again

319
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,440
useful information and you'll see why in

320
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
a bit

321
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,000
now

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
when you're performing reconnaissance

323
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,320
you don't want to stand out you know if

324
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,040
i want to go and look at this door over

325
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
here

326
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,440
i don't want to come here and i know

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
we've all got amazing hive visas on so i

328
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
probably would blend in today if i had

329
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
high vis but i'm not going to go

330
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,279
oh great

331
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,519
door yeah okay yeah oh there's a swipe

332
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,200
card yeah brilliant okay you don't want

333
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
to do that because you're going to stand

334
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,240
out and someone's going to go what's

335
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
that guy doing

336
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
so you want to blend in

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
and

338
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
one of the things i talk about in my

339
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,680
2018 talk is going and sitting reception

340
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,839
and looking at how people dress because

341
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,680
that's quite important you want to blend

342
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
in you don't want to stand out

343
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,480
and

344
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,079
we're going to see some ways that these

345
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
people are blending in

346
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,959
so we mentioned

347
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,720
that all the sports facilities are in

348
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
hotels

349
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,440
anybody for tennis

350
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
so um the tennis team as i have

351
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
as i've nicknamed them they've actually

352
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
been sat in reception so when the victim

353
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,560
entered the country they weren't sure

354
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,079
which hotel they were gonna it was gonna

355
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,360
stay and which one he was gonna check

356
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
into so they had various teams dotted

357
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,399
around the hotel sat in reception which

358
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,000
is something i recommend doing when

359
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,279
you're going and trying to get into a

360
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,040
business or an office or something go

361
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
and sit in reception they are doing

362
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
exactly this they are sat in reception

363
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,200
waiting for the victim to come in

364
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
now they've been sat in there for a

365
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,680
while

366
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,720
and when the victim checks in and again

367
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,079
i'm not showing this but you'll see it

368
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,880
in the main video

369
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
the guy is checking in and he's talking

370
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
to the receptionist and he's getting his

371
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
key card and bloody blah

372
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
one of the sports team is literally

373
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
right here

374
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,519
looking straight at him on the phone

375
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,240
dressed in his in his tennis gear

376
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,839
now i'm assuming

377
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,800
that

378
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,440
either they didn't hear what room number

379
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
he was given

380
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,000
or

381
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
they wanted to go and double check

382
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,519
and so

383
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,839
this happens

384
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
now the guy in the black there is the

385
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,079
victim and the lady that you can see on

386
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,800
the left hand side is a member of the

387
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,639
hotel reception team

388
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
now interestingly and i've never had

389
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
this happen to me in many many hotels

390
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,000
that i've had to check in through

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
through work and stuff she is taking him

392
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,360
up to his room to show him where it is

393
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
now this is quite unusual

394
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,880
but look out for the two guys

395
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,950
we're going to the lift

396
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,920
[Music]

397
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
super quick walking

398
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
i want to get in that lift with this guy

399
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
they come out

400
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,240
she says we need to go to the left here

401
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,279
the two tennis guys hang around

402
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,560
one of them points to the other guy and

403
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
says go on you go and watch how slowly

404
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,040
he walks because he doesn't want to

405
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
catch up with the victim he just wants

406
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,199
to go to the room and see where it is

407
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,560
the other interesting thing on that

408
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
return journey there is it's quite

409
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
difficult to see he looks up because

410
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
there is an emergency exit sign a bit

411
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
like this and he is checking where that

412
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,959
exit is in case he needs to get out

413
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,680
so the sports team come back

414
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,079
she is obviously very relaxed around the

415
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,680
guy in the white t-shirt because they're

416
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,440
having a laugh and a joke here's me mate

417
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
hi mate great come back and then they

418
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,279
walk around the corridor

419
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,399
so that's one piece of reconnaissance

420
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,320
really interesting

421
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,360
amazing how quickly they sped up to get

422
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,120
in that lift at the same time as the

423
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,399
victim

424
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
it was almost a run

425
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,199
but yeah they get it and you know they

426
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,360
now know they've now confirmed what room

427
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
is in

428
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,360
what's interesting is you can see here

429
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,839
on the right that is basically a balcony

430
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,320
and there are some chairs down there on

431
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
that lower floor and we'll see those in

432
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
a bit

433
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,839
so

434
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,759
another reconnaissance team comes in

435
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,320
you will see in the footage that it's

436
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,120
got gntv in the top corner so i should

437
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
have explained that it's golf news

438
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,680
television

439
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,199
so you'll see that on lots of these

440
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,000
pieces of footage

441
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,480
i have called these guys the not so

442
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
sports team

443
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,399
because i wasn't quite sure what they

444
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
were doing but here they are

445
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,320
two jets coming in one in red one in

446
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,839
blue got hold all on guys on the phone

447
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
you can see in that top left hand corner

448
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,040
some people sat down i zoomed in a

449
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
little bit here again apologize for the

450
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,920
for the blurry footage terrible quality

451
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,279
cctv but we saw there the two guys from

452
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,720
the tennis team

453
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
with the white towel and the blue

454
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,800
t-shirt and the guy with the white and

455
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,199
they get up and they walk away and

456
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,759
magically the not so sports team come in

457
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,440
and sit in exactly the same spot

458
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
well that's interesting

459
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,390
why have they done that

460
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,759
[Music]

461
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
we'll come to that in a bit

462
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
so they've been there for an amount of

463
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,360
time um i've no idea how long probably a

464
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
couple of hours and

465
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,880
you know when you're being when you're

466
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,240
doing a reconnaissance you don't want to

467
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
hang around in the same place too long

468
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
because even being there too long could

469
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
alert suspicion so

470
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,730
we get some tourists come in to see

471
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,759
[Music]

472
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,040
now

473
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
the tourists are interesting here they

474
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,879
are as a lady and a man

475
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,400
and

476
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
they come in now what i find unusual

477
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,400
here and we'll see this in a second is

478
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
they talk about them using special

479
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,679
communications devices and it looks like

480
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,280
they're trying to fit an earpiece and a

481
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,919
wire and something down on the on the

482
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,959
ladies

483
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,480
belt

484
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,599
which

485
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
i personally find

486
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,559
unusual

487
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,760
because that is a very very public space

488
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
you're in a reception of a massive hotel

489
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,799
and there's lots of people around why

490
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,760
would you fiddle with your

491
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
communications equipment in that

492
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
particular spot

493
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,280
why not do it somewhere else like out of

494
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
the way so that was unusual um but you

495
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
can see there in the top corner the not

496
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
so sports team are leaving and if you

497
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
look really really carefully the two

498
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
tourists actually turn a look at the

499
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,679
sports that seem to say yeah we're ready

500
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
then they get up and then they walk away

501
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,720
and then eventually uh the tourists go

502
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,559
therefore followed by a local arab

503
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,160
gentleman who looks like he's trying to

504
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
get to the same seats as they are

505
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,120
they spot that and they jump in there so

506
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
that they get exactly the same seat so

507
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,400
you've got three different teams

508
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
sat in the same area in the same seats

509
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
over the period of a day

510
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,250
and that is unusual

511
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,120
[Music]

512
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,720
so a couple of things there

513
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
why were they sat there

514
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,280
anybody know anyone who want to shout

515
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,039
out why you think they were he was sat

516
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
there

517
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
sorry

518
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,360
ah almost yeah it's it's a good idea for

519
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,240
sure

520
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
and you're you're almost right

521
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,120
sorry

522
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,640
clearest for you in the balcony

523
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,280
absolutely yeah so and i'll show you

524
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
some pictures of this in a minute they

525
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
were sat there because

526
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,039
they could see his corridor

527
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,080
uh and it's open the hotel is open

528
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,880
inside so all of the rooms are around

529
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
the outside of the building and the

530
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,080
inside the sort of middle corner is open

531
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,400
all the way up to the very very top and

532
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,440
as um

533
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,559
if you look at the photos there's a

534
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,240
really beautiful uh

535
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,320
stained glass window glass thing at the

536
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
very very top but they're sat there

537
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
because they can see

538
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,919
the guy's room and his corridor but also

539
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,919
because they if they miss him coming out

540
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,799
of his room or his corridor um they also

541
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,760
get a great view of um the reception and

542
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
the only entrance or the motor the main

543
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
entrance

544
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,760
is that reception area so they've got

545
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,440
this phenomenal view they can see

546
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,039
reception here

547
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,559
and they can see his room and his

548
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,559
corridor on the top there and that is

549
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,320
why they sat there and that's really

550
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
clever

551
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,640
and when i go into um into buildings and

552
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,559
i try and do reconnaissance that is

553
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,120
exactly the same thing i suggest

554
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,039
to anybody who wants to learn this sort

555
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,440
of stuff do exactly the same thing go

556
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
and sit in a place where you can see the

557
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,320
maximum amount of information and take

558
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
it all in because that's really really

559
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,360
useful

560
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,400
now

561
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,559
my objectives tend to be a lot different

562
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,640
for this team's objectives

563
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
and most of my objectives are can you

564
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,240
get into the building can you go and

565
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,159
plug into a network can you go and take

566
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,919
the red folder from the finance team

567
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,919
that kind of stuff

568
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,919
but i still want to absorb all of that

569
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,520
information about

570
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
what can i see

571
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,760
how many cctv cameras are there what are

572
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,679
they wearing how are they wearing their

573
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
badges all of that information

574
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,919
when you're doing reconnaissance is

575
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
really really useful because it helps

576
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,240
you build up your pretext

577
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,080
and i'll talk about pretext in a second

578
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
so yeah there's the guy the sports team

579
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
the tennis guy uh looking over the

580
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,000
balcony and it's at that point there

581
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,080
that he realizes that those chairs in

582
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
that bottom corner are a great place to

583
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,960
be

584
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
uh and this is from the hotel's website

585
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
itself

586
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
and um essentially

587
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,240
they're in the one of the front corners

588
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
up there

589
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
and they can see his room from that from

590
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,520
that seating area but yeah you can see

591
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
just about the stained glass windows and

592
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
this this inner roof thing this glass

593
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
roof but yeah that's why they were sat

594
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,120
there and that's really interesting

595
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,480
okay so i mentioned it just a second ago

596
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,559
pretext

597
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,360
um

598
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,200
pretexts are interesting

599
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,000
and

600
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,960
i talk about pretext in uh in my 2018

601
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
talk

602
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
but what is it

603
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
what is it what is a pretext what does

604
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,799
it mean

605
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,919
well

606
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,080
the official sort of dictionary

607
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,960
definition if you like is a reason

608
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,280
given in justification of a course of

609
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,960
action that is not the real reason

610
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
thought

611
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,919
what the hell does that mean i don't

612
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,600
understand what that means

613
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,520
so what does it mean

614
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
it basically means it's the lie that you

615
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,960
are telling

616
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,159
somebody

617
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,799
as to why you were there and doing what

618
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,400
you were doing it's your sort of

619
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,799
justification if you like

620
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,559
but obviously isn't the real reason you

621
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,799
know uh there is a real reason for them

622
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,919
being there if and if they were

623
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,280
challenged is not going to be hey we're

624
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,039
here to murder somebody they're not

625
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,039
going to say that

626
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,400
they're going to say oh i'm here to play

627
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
tennis or i'm here to see the sights or

628
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
i'm here to go to the gym

629
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,360
so how do we see this in the in that in

630
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
that tennis team um remember there are

631
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
no other tennis courts other than the

632
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
ones in the hotel so here is our guy in

633
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,480
a white t-shirt

634
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
um he's obviously wearing shorts he's

635
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,240
obviously wearing trainers he's got a

636
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,799
tennis racket now

637
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,760
that's

638
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,919
unusual because normally if you go and

639
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
play tennis you have a bag or a rucksack

640
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,600
why is that tennis racquet not in his

641
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,120
rucksack because that's normally how you

642
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,159
would carry

643
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,120
a tennis racquet

644
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
and i think it's just because he wants

645
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
to reinforce the fact that he's here to

646
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
play tennis and so he's got it out on

647
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,840
show to say as like a badge almost hey

648
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
i'm playing tennis look at me i've got a

649
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
tennis racket

650
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,080
rather than hiding it away in the back

651
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,120
the other thing that i think is

652
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
interesting is he's got a brochure and

653
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640
again i apologize for the [ __ ] uh

654
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
cctv footage he's got a brochure in his

655
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,840
hand i think that he has been to the gym

656
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
in the tennis area and picked up one of

657
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,600
their brochures because it will have the

658
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,320
hotel name on it and the logo on it

659
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,120
which again is reinforcing the story as

660
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
to why he should be there i'm here to

661
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,440
play tennis look at my tennis racket and

662
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
also i've got the hotels bro brochure

663
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,799
shop i should definitely be in this

664
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,520
hotel and it's just that reinforcement

665
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,000
of his story his pretext to say yeah i

666
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
should be here

667
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,559
now the other guy is the same slightly

668
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,640
different outfit he's got a white towel

669
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,559
around him as if to say hey i've already

670
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,440
played a hard game of tennis

671
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,600
and a bottle of water as well but it

672
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
looks roughly the same again got his

673
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
tennis racquet out in his hand

674
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
it's that reinforcement thing hey i'm

675
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,679
here to play tennis

676
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,480
yeah

677
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
and then there's two of the guys walking

678
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,120
away again they look like they are here

679
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,360
to play tennis you would not question

680
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
them as to what else they would be doing

681
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,720
because it visually is so obvious

682
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,400
they're here to play tennis

683
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,480
so their pretext story is going to be

684
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,640
with tennis players and it worked

685
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
because nobody questioned them and

686
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
nobody took a second look at them

687
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,159
because they look like tennis players

688
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
um

689
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
so let's look at the not so sports team

690
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
no

691
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
i'm not really sure what their pretext

692
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
would be

693
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,080
not sure what what they're actually

694
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
there to do what what their story was

695
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and obviously we don't get to know that

696
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,400
information so i'm going to make a guess

697
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,520
um

698
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,600
it's not unusual dress style for the

699
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
area they're wearing you know sports

700
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,600
t-shirts if you like tracksuit bottoms

701
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,720
trainers etc it's not unusual

702
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,440
dress style for the for the area they've

703
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,799
got a hold all

704
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,799
i did some research on the on the hotel

705
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,640
that this all happened in and there's a

706
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,000
gym there

707
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,559
and my guess is if anybody asks they

708
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,080
were going to go to the gym or they've

709
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,840
been to the gym something along those

710
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,240
lines and you know

711
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,320
the holders help reinforce that sort of

712
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
gym look if you like they might have

713
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
some towels or something in there

714
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,240
it's quite unusual i couldn't work out

715
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,200
what that

716
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
was i couldn't work out what their

717
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,279
pretext was i have no idea

718
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,440
um so yeah i went with the gym look

719
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
the tourists

720
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,799
now

721
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,200
in dubai there are as we know a lot of

722
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,159
tourists um this is a very very

723
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,880
stereotypical tourist look they've got

724
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
sun hats they've got linen trousers

725
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
um

726
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,840
but what i found interesting and again

727
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,400
these are just hindsight insights if you

728
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
like that we've got because we've got

729
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,120
that ability to look at things in

730
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,320
hindsight

731
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
dubai is not warm

732
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,120
in january this happened in january

733
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,520
and the average temperature in dubai in

734
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
january and i say average because that

735
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
means there's more and less is only 18

736
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,679
degrees

737
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,320
and it's not a warm 18 degrees even

738
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,679
though we know the middle east is being

739
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,400
super super hot it's often very cloudy

740
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
there's often a cold wind

741
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,679
and it does rain

742
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,520
strangely enough they have about three

743
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,279
days of rain uh

744
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,559
in the middle east in january and

745
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,240
february

746
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,200
so

747
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,240
okay

748
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,520
i mean

749
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,919
from a pretext point of view nobody's

750
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,200
going to question them because they

751
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
absolutely like tourists that is what i

752
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
thought you know in our minds eye when

753
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
we look at when we think about what a

754
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
tourist should look like that's it

755
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,120
but with the ability of hindsight you

756
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
just think ah okay this is interesting

757
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,279
is it is it really a tourist i'm not

758
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,520
sure

759
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,760
i'm going to introduce you to another

760
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,600
gentleman who we don't see

761
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,720
just yet

762
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
but we will see him in a video later and

763
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,440
i've called him the blocker i think they

764
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360
uh dubai police called him kevin i

765
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,480
believe

766
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,520
um now kevin is interesting and we'll

767
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,880
see him in a bit

768
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,360
he is carrying essentially a clipboard

769
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,240
with what looks like that same hotel

770
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,919
brochure as the tennis players had

771
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,640
he's dressed in a very dull colored suit

772
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,600
he's got glasses on he's got hair and

773
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,480
i'll explain why the hair comment is

774
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,440
useful in a bit um and you've got that

775
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,039
brochure there he looks like a hell

776
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,760
hotel for you he stood outside the lifts

777
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,039
that we saw earlier on the first floor

778
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,120
where we saw the victim being showed to

779
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,559
his room in the corridor and a tennis

780
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,880
team following him down he is stood

781
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,840
there

782
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,720
in this particular still

783
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
now if i came out of those lists and i

784
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,039
saw him stood there

785
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
in those colors and things i think he

786
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
was a hotel employee he looks like one

787
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,120
and he's got a big smile on his face he

788
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
looks nice and friendly

789
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,880
so i think what's really important is

790
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,840
matching your outfits to your pretext

791
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,679
now in the video dubai police say these

792
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,480
people are changing their look for a

793
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,399
disguise purpose

794
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,080
and i don't think so i think they're

795
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
actually changing their outfits to match

796
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,919
a pretext

797
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,520
um so i'm going to show you a very quick

798
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,480
video

799
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,039
here's a gentleman in a blue blue tie

800
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,120
bold hair no glasses

801
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,679
going into some changing rooms

802
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,000
with a suitcase

803
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
and here he is coming out

804
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,159
the two do not look the same

805
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,240
and that is really clever

806
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,159
because they are the same person but

807
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,640
he's made some very simple changes

808
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,159
now this is the lady that we saw a

809
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,919
minute ago who was in the sun hat with

810
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,760
the tourists

811
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
and she goes in and again very subtle

812
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
changes she's got a hair and a bun you

813
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,760
just you take her sunglasses off she

814
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,880
comes out she looks different

815
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,480
and she's pulled her hair down by the

816
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
side of her face she's taking the

817
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,679
sunglasses off it looks like she's

818
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,360
untucked her blouse a little bit and

819
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
changed the dress but not a great deal

820
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
or changed the dress style

821
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,520
of the way she's wearing her jacket

822
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,279
but not a great deal

823
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,159
and they are really really simple things

824
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,039
to change how those people look

825
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,320
and

826
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,159
i suspect

827
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
that they brought all of that stuff

828
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,000
locally in dubai

829
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,279
because if you had a wig in your

830
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,360
suitcase somebody might go right have

831
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
you got a wig in your suitcase so i

832
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,880
suspect that they bought all these

833
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,600
really simple things in dubai locally

834
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,480
now

835
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,840
as i said dubai police think this was a

836
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,159
disguise um and i'm not convinced it is

837
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,360
i think

838
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
that they are changing themselves for

839
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,080
sure which i guess is kind of a disguise

840
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
but i think they're doing it to match

841
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,720
the pretext

842
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,640
and they're going to be hotel employees

843
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
and i'll show you a video of both of

844
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,039
those two

845
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,320
pretending to be hotel employees later

846
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,559
but they are changing

847
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,000
their dress style to match their pretext

848
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,399
and i think that's really uh interesting

849
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,840
um and very clever as well

850
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,279
and i mentioned this a bit in uh my

851
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,640
previous talk

852
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,760
you know if you're going to go in

853
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,080
somewhere and one of my common ones and

854
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,000
if you've seen me talk before

855
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,760
i often pretend that my name is leon and

856
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,480
i'm from the it network team

857
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,640
dress like that bring some things with

858
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
you some props and stuff

859
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,559
uh and and similarly you know if you're

860
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,919
saying that you're going to be an alarm

861
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,880
engineer dress like an alarm engineer if

862
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,240
you you're pretending to be an alarm

863
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,919
engineer and you turn up in a suit and

864
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,799
tie

865
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,559
what you're telling the person who is

866
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,039
challenging you and what you look like

867
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,679
are two completely different things and

868
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,799
they're not going to match up and then

869
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,320
they're going to go you don't look like

870
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
an alarm engineer i'm going to challenge

871
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,440
you even more

872
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,880
whereas if you dress like an arm

873
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
engineer maybe you've got cargo trousers

874
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
on and you know you've got pockets full

875
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
of tools or something in there

876
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,679
you're going to look like an alarm

877
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
engineer the two things are going to add

878
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,640
up and the person challenges you're

879
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,240
going to go he's telling me he's alarm

880
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,159
engineer he looks like his alarm

881
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,799
engineer perfect he's alarm engineer

882
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,679
he's gotta be right

883
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,240
props are also really really useful

884
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,320
um props to support that pretext are

885
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,559
really important

886
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,039
uh badges for example i'm just going to

887
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,120
use badges as one particular prop

888
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,679
example now being a social engineer and

889
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,760
doing lots of these types of jobs you

890
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,440
often build up a collection of badges

891
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
that look like this

892
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,559
um

893
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
and

894
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,000
i'll tell you

895
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,320
a story that happened probably um

896
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
beginning of this year

897
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,519
now i'm wearing a badge which you can

898
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,440
see on there

899
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,279
that says contractor

900
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,799
and the badge itself is blank it's got a

901
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,240
little bar code on but there's nothing

902
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
on the other side and it literally says

903
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,480
contractor that's all it says there's no

904
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,840
other identification on here whatsoever

905
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,200
now um at the beginning of the year i

906
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,679
was tasked with getting into an office

907
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,519
in central london

908
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,519
and it was a satellite office for an

909
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,159
american company

910
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,679
so i thought okay

911
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,880
i can come up with this and uh i went in

912
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,799
there i got onto the floor that they

913
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,480
were on someone came up to me and are

914
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,360
you okay and i went yeah yeah i'm uh

915
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,840
from company x which is the company that

916
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,039
i was supposed to be from and

917
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,200
i am over from the us office and i've

918
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,919
come to work in the uk for a week

919
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,679
i hear you've got some hot desks and you

920
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,080
point them out to me

921
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,320
and that person went oh

922
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,799
yeah hold on a minute come on through

923
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,480
come on throw into our super secure

924
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,760
office and here's the hot desks for you

925
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
and uh let me show you what the tea and

926
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,159
coffee machine is and uh i'll take you

927
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,720
to show you where the toilets are and oh

928
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,480
by the way would you like to meet our

929
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,399
ceo and our ceo and i was like

930
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,640
sure why the hell not well yeah i'll

931
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
meet these people

932
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,640
and it was crazy it was absolutely crazy

933
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,519
now

934
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,960
the really astute and the really

935
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
observant among you will realize that i

936
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
do not have an american accent

937
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,080
and i didn't even try to put one on

938
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,240
either because accents are dodgy and

939
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,080
they often slip and then it

940
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,519
you get caught and stuff like that and

941
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,200
it's not a good idea

942
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
so i said

943
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,799
i was from the u.s office

944
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,600
and i said i was a contractor and the

945
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,559
only piece of evidence if you like that

946
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,480
i was any of those things

947
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,519
was this contractor lanyard on my on my

948
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,480
chest

949
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,760
that was it

950
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,279
but because i said there was a

951
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,279
contractor and because i've got a prop

952
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,000
that reinforced that they believed me

953
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,039
they were like yes come on in come on in

954
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
um

955
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,760
what was also crazy is uh they tried to

956
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,359
give me a visitors badge because the

957
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,280
toilets were in a

958
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,599
in a stairwell which was flight

959
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,719
controlled

960
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,159
and they couldn't get the visitor badge

961
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,320
system working they couldn't activate

962
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
one of the businesses patches

963
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,440
so they went to the coo and said hey

964
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
do you mind if leon borrows your badge

965
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,719
for a second so he can go to the toilet

966
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,079
yeah sure no problem here you go and i

967
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,159
had the ceo's badge for the day

968
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,359
there was no verification no nothing it

969
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,040
was just one plus one equals two he said

970
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,199
he's a contractor he's got a contractor

971
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,480
lanyard on

972
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,170
let him in

973
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,839
[Music]

974
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,760
another um

975
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,000
another war story if you like around

976
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,359
props

977
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,920
uh and this was a job that i luckily got

978
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,760
to do with a colleague of mine a guy

979
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,880
called luke hey luke

980
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,359
we went to a

981
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,920
manufacturing facility um not far from

982
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,040
here actually

983
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,000
and we've been tasked with getting in

984
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,720
we got in quite uh easily unfortunately

985
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,040
um and

986
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,640
we set ourselves up in an office we

987
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,160
found a nice empty office we set

988
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,079
ourselves up in there it was fantastic

989
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,680
we were all cozy

990
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,440
the client contact came to us and said

991
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,240
right

992
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,079
it's brilliant that you've got here it

993
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,760
was too easy i want to set you another

994
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,839
challenge now this often happens when

995
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,520
you do social engineering you get in

996
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
somewhere and unfortunately the client

997
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,040
contact goes

998
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,480
that was too easy

999
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
what difficult thing can i set them to

1000
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,359
do that they're gonna fail at i know

1001
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,079
you need to get into our server room

1002
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,320
okay yeah we'll give that a go

1003
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,880
so we ditched our rucksacks and we

1004
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,280
literally carried a laptop

1005
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,119
and we knew where the server room was

1006
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,400
because we'd walked around the building

1007
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,680
earlier

1008
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,839
and luke and i we get up to the server

1009
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,640
room

1010
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,560
and we look around and we've got like a

1011
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,400
badge on and we we're pressing it

1012
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,560
against the id badge system the swipe

1013
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,839
card system nothing

1014
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,920
happens a lady walks past and goes

1015
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,000

1016
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,040

1017
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560

1018
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,480
could you help us um we're bt engineers

1019
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
and um we need to do some software

1020
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
upgrades on your telephone system but

1021
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,000
unfortunately we can't get into the

1022
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,440
server room

1023
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,560
now

1024
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,800
we had smart trousers on we had a polo

1025
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,880
shirt on it had a logo on but it wasn't

1026
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,079
a bt logo and we had a laptop

1027
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,240
and so we got these props that made us

1028
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,800
look like we were bt engineers and then

1029
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,160
we said we're doing a software upgrade

1030
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,000
so we've got a laptop in our hand you

1031
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,920
would you need to do a software upgrade

1032
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,119
right

1033
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,440
and she went oh

1034
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,640
um

1035
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,240
okay hold on a minute and she brought

1036
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
her badge up er

1037
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,520
you're not coming in

1038
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,320
oh

1039
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,280
oh she said uh hold on a minute

1040
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,560
and she walked into that floor's office

1041
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,760
and she went

1042
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,119
hey everybody

1043
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,560
these two guys need to get into the

1044
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,800
server room has anybody got a badge that

1045
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,880
works on the server room door

1046
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,160
and literally everybody in that office

1047
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,839
got up and came out let me try mine

1048
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,520
no it doesn't work okay your turn next

1049
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,920
person comes up

1050
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,839
that doesn't work either next one comes

1051
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,920
up

1052
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,839
the whole office tried

1053
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,599
none of their badges worked

1054
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,000
and the original lady went oh

1055
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,119
i know

1056
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,359
hold on a second

1057
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,880
and she marched off

1058
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
and she came back 30 seconds later and

1059
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
she had another badge in her hand she

1060
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,720
put it up against the system and he went

1061
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,880
ding you can go in

1062
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,040
oh yeah it's okay i just went to the

1063
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,560
cfo's office and borrowed his badge

1064
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,960
okay

1065
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,400
and she let us in we sat in the server

1066
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,880
room we did our software upgrade which

1067
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,560
was basically us plug into the network

1068
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,960
and hacking it from in there uh we took

1069
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,599
some photos of us in the in the server

1070
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,440
room sent them to the client and he went

1071
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,680
i need a harder challenge um

1072
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,760
but the

1073
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,839
the crucial bit there is if you're going

1074
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,920
to come up with a story for a pretext

1075
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,560
think about what else you need to

1076
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,720
support that story

1077
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,359
uh and think about how you can reinforce

1078
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,920
it and as we've seen in these videos it

1079
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,320
doesn't even need to be that strong a

1080
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,960
thing it can be so loose

1081
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,640
you know we were in

1082
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
polo next shirts and some smarties

1083
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,880
trousers we said we're a bt engineer we

1084
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,119
had a laptop that was it

1085
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,520
that was all that i had or we had rather

1086
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,800
luke and i had

1087
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,960
to convince somebody that that's what we

1088
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,480
should be doing

1089
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,960
likewise in the u.s office thing in the

1090
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,760
uk office he said it was a contractor i

1091
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,000
had a contractor badge a lanyard on that

1092
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,240
is it but

1093
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
to the person questioning you they're

1094
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,359
going to go one plus one equals two

1095
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,599
ding you can go in

1096
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,359
so think about those those props and

1097
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,880
those pretexts

1098
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,040
um excuse me one second i'm gonna have

1099
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,520
some water

1100
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,379
[Music]

1101
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,440
okay

1102
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,599
um one of the other things that i uh

1103
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,520
suggest doing

1104
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,599
when you're doing reconnaissance is

1105
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,680
hanging around

1106
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,880
now

1107
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,720
if i'm hanging around a very super

1108
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,880
secure door like this

1109
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
and i'm sort of stood there like this

1110
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
like just looking at the door waiting

1111
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,839
for somebody to come in so i can

1112
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,520
tailgate them in

1113
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,240
i'm going to look suspicious

1114
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,839
and somebody's going to go what are you

1115
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,520
doing and that's as a social engineer

1116
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,280
not what you want to happen you want to

1117
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
blend in you want to look like you

1118
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,400
should be there

1119
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
and the easiest way to do this

1120
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,160
is is on a phone really

1121
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,720
so we've got these two people here and

1122
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,359
um they are hanging around

1123
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,640
outside the first floor lift

1124
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,760
but again

1125
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,839
uh the gentleman on the left there who

1126
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,440
we saw earlier is now wearing a wig and

1127
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,040
some glasses he's got a phone in his

1128
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,319
hand and i'm going to show you a video

1129
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,680
of that in a second

1130
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,560
and then the lady that we saw

1131
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,319
she's got some paperwork and she's

1132
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,160
clutching that to her to her chest and

1133
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,400
she again she looks like she's a hotel

1134
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,839
employee two very good ways of of

1135
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,680
validating if you like that it's okay

1136
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
for those people to be there

1137
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,680
now i've called these two if you like

1138
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
the watch out team

1139
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
and because we saw them from that

1140
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,520
disguise video earlier

1141
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,480
and um the male guy kevin he hangs

1142
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,359
around outside the lift for a long time

1143
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,040
and then the lady in the video has

1144
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,880
disappeared

1145
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,160
i think she's disappeared um because she

1146
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
was at the opposite end of the of the

1147
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
corridor where we saw the tennis guy

1148
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,480
looking over the balcony earlier i think

1149
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
she's up there because his room the

1150
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,079
victim's room is in the middle between

1151
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,640
the lifts and that end point

1152
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,839
so i think they're in there

1153
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,079
they're doing this on purpose because

1154
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,680
they're trying to cover any sort of

1155
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
entry and exit points

1156
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
and at this particular moment in time in

1157
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,680
the video the victim has gone out

1158
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,200
and he's gone shopping

1159
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,920
and so his room is unguarded if you like

1160
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,599
uh and again i'm not going to show you

1161
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,640
this because i didn't think it's that

1162
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,680
relevant

1163
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,560
but they try and reprogram

1164
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,400
one of their own

1165
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,680
um hotel badges to the same room number

1166
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,000
as his to try and get into his room to

1167
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,839
surprise him when he comes back

1168
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,240
it doesn't actually work

1169
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,200
which is interesting

1170
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,560
because i suspect having done some jobs

1171
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,119
in the middle east that the hotel door

1172
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,880
keycard system is probably not that

1173
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,920
clever and not that good

1174
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,440
so it is unusual that that reprogramming

1175
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,760
of the door didn't work

1176
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,960
my guess

1177
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,280
is they didn't have a lot of tools and

1178
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,720
stuff with them because if they came

1179
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
through airport security and therefore

1180
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,000
security said

1181
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,760
what's this thing here well that's a key

1182
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,000
card reprogrammer whoa why have you got

1183
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,960
that

1184
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,480
i think they didn't have a lot of

1185
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,760
technology or didn't bring a lot of

1186
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,560
technology with them and so had to buy

1187
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,480
stuff that was local that is my guess

1188
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,319
but it failed and they found another way

1189
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,200
in

1190
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,040
but what's interesting

1191
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,319
these are the lists these are the lists

1192
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,520
on the first floor this is not the

1193
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,079
reception list

1194
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,760
we're going to see that the guy

1195
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,800
literally

1196
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,760
facing up and down

1197
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,560
i'm on the phone

1198
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,920
and he's there for a long time

1199
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,040
but it's not suspicious activity

1200
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,280
it's not unusual for people to be

1201
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,520
hanging around on phones outside lifts

1202
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,760
especially because most of us know if we

1203
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,079
go in the lift it's a big metal box

1204
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,440
you lose your phone signal and you can't

1205
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,000
make a phone call anymore so you would

1206
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,640
naturally stand outside the lift and

1207
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,760
complete your phone call before going in

1208
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,680
and again it's all these small little

1209
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,280
details that make these things work

1210
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,240
so

1211
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
it is a really really great trick

1212
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,680
because again if i was up at this secure

1213
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,280
door

1214
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,119
i rather than me standing here looking

1215
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,800
at the secure door waiting for someone

1216
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
to come in so that i can tailgate them

1217
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,720
in if i'm on the phone like this and i'm

1218
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,079
going hi yeah how are you doing today

1219
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,920
oh someone's going in yeah yeah no i'm

1220
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,400
just coming into the office now boom i

1221
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,079
go straight in

1222
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,520
and that's roughly what they're doing

1223
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,760
there pretending to be on the phone it's

1224
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,200
a really really great trick

1225
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,720
because no one's going to bother you

1226
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,560
when you're on the phone right we're all

1227
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,520
polite human beings and nobody wants to

1228
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,680
interrupt a phone call to go excuse me

1229
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,160
what are you doing here nobody does that

1230
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,520
because we're all polite and we're all

1231
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,319
helpful and nice um

1232
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,040
so

1233
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,119
it's it's really really useful it's a

1234
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,560
great way

1235
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,200
to hang around somewhere and not look

1236
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,040
too suspicious because that's what

1237
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,720
people do when they take phone calls

1238
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,200
they hang around on the phone and wander

1239
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,200
about

1240
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,400
because yeah you're just on the phone

1241
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,400
now

1242
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,880
this is an interesting part of the video

1243
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,839
um

1244
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,720
and

1245
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
it's quite difficult because of the way

1246
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,800
that the gulf news television

1247
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,040
put subtitles along the bottom

1248
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,880
it's quite difficult to see it so i've

1249
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,800
tried to zoom in as much as possible

1250
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,680
but

1251
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,599
when the two of them are trying to get

1252
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,599
in or the sorry the other part of the

1253
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,240
team is trying to reprogram the victim's

1254
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,640
door to his key card and trying to get

1255
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,359
in

1256
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,200
a genuine hotel customer comes out of

1257
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,760
the lift on that floor

1258
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,960
now

1259
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,359
if you're an assassination squad you

1260
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,720
don't want to be caught in the act of

1261
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
trying to reprogram someone's door and

1262
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,440
so some interesting things happen

1263
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,680
um

1264
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
and yeah i've tried to show it as best i

1265
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,880
can it's difficult i will explain it

1266
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,599
so the genuine customer comes out

1267
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,359
the gentleman kevin

1268
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,400
literally

1269
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,160
magically appears as soon as he hears

1270
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,680
the lift door go bing

1271
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,200
he magically appears from around the

1272
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,079
corner and he

1273
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,800
intersects if you like the the

1274
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,400
the uh customer

1275
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
and he's got his notepad with him as

1276
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,400
well he's got that brochure that we saw

1277
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,319
earlier and again i think he's got that

1278
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,079
brochure because it's got logos on it

1279
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,000
which we've got the hotel name on it and

1280
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,160
again it all reinforces that idea that

1281
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,680
he should absolutely be there

1282
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,599
but yeah there's something going on down

1283
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,680
the corridor that he does not want this

1284
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,480
hotel customer to see

1285
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,720
and so he needs to stop

1286
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,079
this customer

1287
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,119
to get the team time to get out and get

1288
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,319
away

1289
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,279
so let's watch this

1290
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,599
here's the genuine customer

1291
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,599
coming out he's looking a little lost

1292
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,560
boom kevin's appeared out of there he's

1293
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,920
got his notepad

1294
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,359
he does this

1295
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,440
he does a very subtle

1296
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,160
hand symbol he doesn't do this because

1297
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,800
that would be rude he does this

1298
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,880
and it's a very subtle hand signal to

1299
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,119
say whoa there sunshine i don't want you

1300
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,800
to go any further please stop here

1301
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,160
because there's some bad stuff going on

1302
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,560
down there

1303
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,000
and it's really really subtle it's so

1304
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
subtle it's really difficult to see and

1305
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,920
the subtitles don't help so i've tried

1306
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,079
to take the video and zoom in on it a

1307
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,319
little bit

1308
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,319
he literally takes his hand off of his

1309
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,640
notepad and does that

1310
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,280
and the customer stops now he's also

1311
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,040
blocking that archway so that the

1312
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,680
customer can't walk down the corridor

1313
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,400
um but it's really really subtle but it

1314
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,960
worked and because he's got that persona

1315
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,440
of i'm a hotel employee i look like a

1316
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,079
hotel employee i've got my notepad i've

1317
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,079
got my brochure he's not going to

1318
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,079
question it he's not going to go

1319
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,119
get out of me way he's actually gonna go

1320
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:25,920
oh

1321
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,520
you can help me because you're smiling

1322
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,800
and you've got all the notepad and stuff

1323
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,960
like that and he interacts with him and

1324
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,599
it gives the team behind in the corridor

1325
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,119
enough time to get out and move

1326
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,599
now the other interesting thing that

1327
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,760
happens as well and um

1328
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,160
i owned an art about including this uh

1329
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,680
and i talked it over with my wife and we

1330
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,200
said actually it's quite interesting

1331
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,520
it's an interesting maneuver i've never

1332
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,920
done this or had to do it but i can see

1333
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,079
why it's there

1334
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,160
and you may come across an opportunity

1335
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,559
or a thing a situation where you might

1336
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,319
need to use this

1337
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,800
i've called it the block

1338
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,960
and what happens is i'll show you the

1339
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,400
video let's see if we can work it out

1340
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,200
so same same thing

1341
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,160
customer comes out

1342
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,800
now watch what kevin does here he

1343
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,400
interacts with the customer just the

1344
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,040
stop symbol he's blocking that archway

1345
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,960
behind so the guy can't get to the cut

1346
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,720
to the corridor

1347
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,319
then look at that the key card that the

1348
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,000
customer's got and tried to work out i

1349
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,280
don't know what the conversation is it

1350
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,440
goes on a little while

1351
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,720
they're trying to work out what's on the

1352
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,400
key card so we can try and help the

1353
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
customer help the customer get to his

1354
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,880
room so look at the key card now what's

1355
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,640
really interesting is the way first of

1356
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,599
all kevin puts his notepad he's creating

1357
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,480
a barrier between him and the customer

1358
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,319
by putting that notepad there and he's

1359
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,400
changed hands but he's also making the

1360
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,559
customer look that way when the hallway

1361
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,680
is that way which is clever

1362
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,760
but again he's using that notepad as a

1363
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,160
barrier against the customer and then as

1364
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,760
the customer works out where he's going

1365
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,000
he's creating another block and then he

1366
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,559
walks slowly and kind of walks in front

1367
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,720
of the customer to slow him down and

1368
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,880
then stops in the archway so the

1369
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,520
customer can't get through

1370
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,880
now

1371
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,440
that's actually really clever

1372
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,000
i don't think in most cases as a social

1373
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,920
engineer we would need to use that i've

1374
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,440
not come across a situation where i

1375
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,599
needed to block somebody

1376
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,359
but it's very subtle

1377
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,119
and it's very effective because it

1378
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,720
obviously gave the team who were trying

1379
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,000
to break into the guy's room enough time

1380
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,559
to get out

1381
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,399
how are we doing okay

1382
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,760
so

1383
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,400
let's wrap this up a little bit

1384
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,079
if

1385
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,240
this was mossad

1386
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,079
we have just witnessed

1387
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,400
possibly some of the best social

1388
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,559
engineers in the world

1389
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,359
and

1390
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,760
they literally did get away with murder

1391
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,880
um

1392
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,440
they left the country uh two hours after

1393
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,200
they committed the murder

1394
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,280
and they've never been seen again

1395
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,480
so

1396
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
these techniques that we're seeing here

1397
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,200
are so good they literally got away with

1398
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,520
murder

1399
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,520
they're obviously very very well drilled

1400
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,040
they've obviously got a lot of backup

1401
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,520
and stuff um they'd obviously

1402
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,280
done lots of practice in terms of doing

1403
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,040
the changeover for the reconnaissance in

1404
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,559
that hotel reception which is very

1405
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,559
clever

1406
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,400
the blocking stuff was very clever the

1407
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,640
little hand gesture was very clever

1408
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,200
the ability to blend in and stuff in a

1409
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,119
foreign country that you're technically

1410
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,559
enemies with

1411
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,599
no embassy support and you know as we're

1412
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,119
seeing with um

1413
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,559
lots of countries at the moment we're

1414
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,280
getting embassy staff expelled because

1415
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,880
they're spies and stuff like that there

1416
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,960
was none of that local support there for

1417
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,559
them in this country

1418
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,640
so risky

1419
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,079
um

1420
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,079
as i mentioned earlier i have no idea

1421
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,480
how they got out of the hotel room

1422
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,680
with the double lock on the chain and no

1423
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,520
signs of forced entry or anything like

1424
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,760
that so that's really interesting i have

1425
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,319
no idea how they did that uh

1426
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,640
and the original video is here

1427
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,599
and um i will post this up on twitter

1428
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,960
somewhere

1429
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,640
and that's roughly it thank you very

1430
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,559
much for listening if anybody's got any

1431
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,400
questions i believe there was a

1432
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,520
gentleman with a microphone going around

1433
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,839
stick your hands up where is the

1434
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,119
gentleman with the microphone

1435
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,920
yeah absolutely

1436
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,130
you're not my sad are you okay good

1437
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,240
[Music]

1438
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,160
i actually had uh

1439
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,720
a bit of nerves around presenting this

1440
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,480
and whether there would be any

1441
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,800
repercussions uh and i thought well you

1442
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,119
know it's it's a long time ago it's

1443
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,400
quite a while ago

1444
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,000
is there a gentleman with a microphone

1445
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,599
or we're just gonna have to shout them

1446
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,520
out

1447
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
no okay

1448
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,280
yeah to go around some questions

1449
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,520
sorry

1450
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,640
yes what did you say

1451
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,319
ah okay it's

1452
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,760
i tell you what let's just shout them

1453
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,559
out uh gentlemen with a mask and i see

1454
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,720
you hand up pretty quickly

1455
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,279
yeah i can hear you

1456
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,160
mm-hmm

1457
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,880
um so the question was just in case

1458
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,480
anybody can hear it uh the team that

1459
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,680
were messing around the tourist team

1460
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,400
that were messing around with the the

1461
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,880
communications equipment in their lobby

1462
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,040
were they possibly trying to smoke out

1463
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,920
other

1464
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,319
covert intelligence um

1465
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,240
possibly

1466
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,000
but it would seem a little weird to burn

1467
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,680
yourself because if you did

1468
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
if you did smoke out cover intelligence

1469
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,680
or another an opposite opposing covert

1470
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,920
intelligence agency um

1471
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,760
you'd burn that team

1472
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,160
and and you'd probably uh

1473
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,559
then trigger an alert and the you know

1474
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,319
other stuff on the cctv we've been

1475
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,240
looked at and reviewed quickly

1476
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,160
so maybe

1477
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,020
but i'm not sure

1478
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,250
[Music]

1479
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,200
i agree

1480
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,359
yes yeah oh yeah there's there's got to

1481
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,800
be a reason i think it's very difficult

1482
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,200
for us to know what that reason would be

1483
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,000
um

1484
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,680
but yeah i'm sure they're doing it for a

1485
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,440
reason i have no idea what it would be

1486
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,640
it's it's like you say it's bad upset uh

1487
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,000
but there must have been a reason either

1488
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,160
it was broken and they had a spare or

1489
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,920
you know as the battery died i have no

1490
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,079
idea but yeah it's an unusual thing to

1491
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,960
do

1492
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,480
if that had been me

1493
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,839
i'd have gone out

1494
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,839
and done it outside in a quiet area

1495
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,599
rather than in the center of a massive

1496
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,480
lobby

1497
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,160
where it's very visible

1498
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,800
okay another question gentlemen in the

1499
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,119
white t-shirt

1500
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,359
okay um so the question was

1501
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,559
when i was reviewing the video was there

1502
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,240
any obvious mistakes um

1503
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:10,000
no not really um

1504
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,760
obviously the opsec thing with the with

1505
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,000
the mic was was weird the communications

1506
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,599
device was strange

1507
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,000
um the fact that the

1508
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,559
door recloning whatever that was didn't

1509
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,559
work was was unusual

1510
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,480
but bearing in mind there was no local

1511
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,480
embassy support and so no

1512
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,640
fellow spies if you like to be able to

1513
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,640
hand them electronic equipment that they

1514
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,240
required elsewhere or they brought in

1515
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,960
through diplomatic bags etc um was

1516
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,440
unusual so for that failing

1517
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,440
but they still got in

1518
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,920
and they still achieved their goal

1519
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,040
um so

1520
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,570
yeah little tweaks maybe but ultimately

1521
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,680
[Music]

1522
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,079
they did what they came to do

1523
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,200
so yeah

1524
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,040
not really i don't think

1525
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,000
other questions i i can see a gentleman

1526
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,359
sorry i'll come back to you i can see a

1527
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,520
gentleman in a black t-shirt

1528
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,000
shout out

1529
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
okay

1530
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,319
okay good questions um

1531
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,558
um

1532
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,960
so i'll be i'll be

1533
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,319
perfectly honest

1534
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,480
because of covid the amount of social

1535
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,760
engineering jobs i'm doing is lessened

1536
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,119
they're still there

1537
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,400
and they're still ticking along and

1538
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,200
still getting more uh you know questions

1539
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,640
about doing them and inquiries and

1540
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,240
scoping and stuff like that so they're

1541
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,040
still there um but they've dropped a bit

1542
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,400
and i think that's because you know

1543
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,119
we've pushed everybody to work from home

1544
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,000
more

1545
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,640
and so the attack vector if you like is

1546
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,400
changing

1547
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,480
because people are not necessarily

1548
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,760
always in the office these days

1549
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,599
it

1550
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,000
it hasn't affected me too much in terms

1551
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,040
of the way i approach jobs

1552
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,720
because of most of the jobs i've had to

1553
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,119
do since sort of you know the unlocking

1554
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,760
of lockdown has still been trying to go

1555
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,000
into facilities or offices or things

1556
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,640
like that so most of the ones that i've

1557
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,359
been tasked with doing have still had

1558
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,079
some kind of person in an office or in

1559
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,880
an area and i've tried to emulate that

1560
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,799
i've not got to the point i've not been

1561
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,599
asked to do any jobs where an office was

1562
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,200
empty

1563
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,040
and so i've not had to change my

1564
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,400
approach in that way

1565
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,640
but i imagine it would come

1566
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,640
and sorry please repeat your first

1567
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,279
question again

1568
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,599
yeah

1569
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,160
ah yes okay sorry um

1570
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,520
if you watch the video it looks like

1571
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,520
they tried to clone the maids card

1572
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,359
and in the beginning of that sort of

1573
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,520
section and again i've cut it out but in

1574
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,880
the beginning of the section where the

1575
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,040
two people are outside the lifts there

1576
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,920
was a trolley a maid trolley in the

1577
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,599
corridor behind them

1578
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,799
so i think and this is a massive guess

1579
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,200
that they tried to clone her card the

1580
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,960
maids card in some way um

1581
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,000
but yeah again there are so many bits of

1582
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,599
this that we're trying to jigsaw piece

1583
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,520
together that we don't know it all and

1584
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,599
it's quite difficult but that would be

1585
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,000
my guess they did i didn't mention this

1586
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,599
because again it wasn't too relevant

1587
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,720
they did hire or rent the room directly

1588
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,640
opposite the victims so they had their

1589
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,160
own key card

1590
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,880
and i think the victim's room was 230

1591
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,200
and they hired 237 which was literally

1592
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,359
opposite so either they tried to get the

1593
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,839
maids card and clone it or they took

1594
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,599
their own card and tried to reprogram it

1595
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,319
in some way probably uh with something

1596
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,839
on a mobile phone you know an app or

1597
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,079
something they got on a mobile phone but

1598
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,160
it wasn't successful and they in the

1599
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,839
video they show you the logs of the

1600
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,680
failed entry as well

1601
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,799
in weirdly in reverse time order

1602
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,720
okay there's a gentleman there with your

1603
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,118
hand up yet

1604
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,119
yeah

1605
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,960
um it's a really

1606
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,000
easy answer but difficult to implement

1607
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,680
i always say trust but verify

1608
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,079
trust the fact that i'm a bt engineer

1609
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,640
but go away and verify it go away you

1610
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,839
know because we're not always very

1611
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,480
confident uh about challenging people

1612
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,079
face to face because it's an awkward

1613
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,680
thing to do

1614
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,200
and we're polite most of the time

1615
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,480
go away and trust that you know take

1616
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
that information trust it but go away

1617
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,559
and verify it hey reception if you just

1618
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,319
let two bt engineers in if they signed

1619
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,359
in and stuff

1620
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,520
or go to the guy who is in charge of the

1621
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,440
server room and go are you expecting

1622
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,599
some bt engineers

1623
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,640
trust but verify what is being said and

1624
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,480
then come back with either a gang of

1625
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
uh muslim people to throw them out or

1626
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,640
whatever but yeah my my suggestion is

1627
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,880
trust but verify go away and verify the

1628
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,839
information you're being told

1629
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,399
yes

1630
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,960
so

1631
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,640
because we do this professionally we're

1632
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,240
given something called a get out of jail

1633
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,160
free letter and they get our jail free

1634
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,040
letter is um something from the ceo or

1635
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,040
the cio or the cso whatever to say chris

1636
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,119
is supposed to be here

1637
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,880
you caught him and he looks suspicious

1638
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,400
fantastic that's really good but he's

1639
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,890
supposed to be here

1640
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,359
[Music]

1641
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,960
don't chuck him in prison kind of thing

1642
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,520
do i get nervous absolutely

1643
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,280
even to this day

1644
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,040
i get nervous at doing social

1645
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,280
engineering jobs because you know we're

1646
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,359
built as human beings to not break into

1647
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,200
things we're told by our parents don't

1648
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,640
break into things that's a bad thing to

1649
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,920
do

1650
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,799
and that's quite difficult to get over

1651
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:15,839
um

1652
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:16,880
and

1653
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,920
um

1654
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,400
the social engineering into an airport

1655
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,200
was

1656
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,359
absolutely the scariest social

1657
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,359
engineering job i've ever done because

1658
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,480
they have guns and a lot of them um

1659
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,960
and they are looking all i thought i

1660
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,720
thought turns out they weren't uh

1661
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,559
looking for people like me trying to

1662
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,319
break into an airport uh turns out they

1663
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,079
weren't very good at that um and i went

1664
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,520
in and out five times because i didn't

1665
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,200
believe how easy it was

1666
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,359
but it is still exceptionally

1667
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,400
nerve-wracking for sure

1668
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
any more questions i conscious a time

1669
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,920
here gentleman over there in a grease

1670
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,240
um yeah i thought about this i thought

1671
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,440
about this a lot um

1672
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,240
my

1673
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,040
guess is they use the window to get out

1674
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,760
i it's the only thing i can think of

1675
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,280
i don't know

1676
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,200
yeah i have not looked at the hotel from

1677
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,599
the outside so i'm not sure but yeah all

1678
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,000
of the hotel rooms are on the outside

1679
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,680
and that's the only thing i can think of

1680
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,079
that would potentially work

1681
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,880
for them to be able to get out

1682
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,720
all right i'm very conscious that it's

1683
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,359
time for me um

1684
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:28,720
