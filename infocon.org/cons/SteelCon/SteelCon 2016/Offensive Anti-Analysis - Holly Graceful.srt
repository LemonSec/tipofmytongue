1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:08,068
hi guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess one thing to start</font>

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,040
I'm holding<font color="#CCCCCC"> a microphone this time</font>

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,630
around if I start doing this then make

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,049
some hand gestures to say put the mic

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,090
back next FS and kill welcome to my

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,800
conference talk I am Holly graceful the

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,660
author of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this pink information security</font>

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,070
blog you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> all follow me on Twitter</font>

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,240
because it's how I judge myself as a

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,890
person no seriously I'll wear<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,169
seriously that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to talk</font>

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,730
about offensive anti analysis which is a

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,160
title that I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> up because it sounds</font>

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,050
cool a better name for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is probably</font>

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,250
Holly's adventures in antivirus evasion

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,750
part 4 um this is an incoherent 45

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,370
minute rant about the antivirus

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,140
community so strap in for that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,699
public speaker normally so we get a

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,840
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit lost about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my slide deck then</font>

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,079
don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it i'll work it out</font>

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,850
but um there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no demos and this one to</font>

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,989
go wrong it's just slides of the content

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,899
so hopefully everything will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work out</font>

25
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:05,548
just fine but part 4 that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> content</font>

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,110
came before it part<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 was um looking at</font>

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,650
antivirus version it was different

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,299
methods of red 90 virus part<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 was that</font>

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,560
time I made an aquarium because my

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,229
landlord tells me I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not allowed pets</font>

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,240
so my aquarium was a whole world of vm

32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,130
set up with different antivirus and had

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,619
fire viruses around the network and see

34
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,850
what happens turns out that someone's

35
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,159
already done this it's called virustotal

36
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,619
calm and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit late to that</font>

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">pie so part 3 was that time that I</font>

38
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,750
hacked virus tall and I didn't as a

39
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,689
story metal and plat for where we're at

40
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,189
now is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a rant about the</font>

41
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,679
web antivirus works the way that the

42
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,809
community works and ultimately my goal

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the end to the end of this talk is</font>

44
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,560
setting up the world's most ironic

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,960
botnet so um sighing at the beginning

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,520
then my last talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said starting at the</font>

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,380
beginning there's two types of antivirus

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,719
this signature analysis and behavioral

49
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,130
analysis and well that's not strictly

50
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,320
true because there's this thing called

51
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,360
next-generation antivirus and that

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,100
sounds really cool and that's the

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with information security se</font>

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,568
because it sounds really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so time to</font>

55
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,859
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> angry we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in</font>

56
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,709
information security where we keep

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,820
militarizing everything

58
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,770
and the some brilliant talks about

59
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,970
reclaiming the word cyber and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally</font>

60
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,120
should but when people use the word

61
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,980
cyber in this kind of style marketing

62
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,460
material<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of style then it really</font>

63
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,670
holds no meaning so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> say next</font>

64
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,640
generation antivirus and we have cyber

65
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> des and things like that well in</font>

66
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,019
the context of antivirus these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,209
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean anything the problem</font>

68
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,130
with that is take a look at malicious

69
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,590
software malware we have antiviral

70
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,470
systems or anti-malware systems to fight

71
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,300
the zero-day cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware's and well</font>

72
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,710
they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for a little while</font>

73
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,570
and you're kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking we were</font>

74
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,880
going to fix it we have done it by now I

75
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,299
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware's 30 years old ransomware</font>

76
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,850
specifically the first ransomware was

77
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,610
1989 that's older than me ransomware is

78
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,500
literally a problem older than I am and

79
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,630
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 years in we're up to</font>

80
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,600
next-generation antivirus and it's going

81
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix all of the problems now with a</font>

82
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,540
problem with antivirus really as I see

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,549
it is um well two sides my<font color="#CCCCCC"> b-sides talk</font>

84
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I ranted about defining malicious and</font>

85
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,280
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a problem the other side of</font>

86
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,770
it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how their</font>

87
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,170
work you you download antiviral software

88
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,710
you installed it on your machine and it

89
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,359
keeps you safe somehow if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

90
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">next gen antivirus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not using</font>

91
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,860
algorithms so next generation antivirus

92
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,980
works it's not signatures or behavior

93
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,310
its algorithm best that keep us safe I'm

94
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,070
sure it will now there's a problem

95
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,600
around next generation<font color="#E5E5E5"> weaponized cyber</font>

96
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero days and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this comes from</font>

97
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,260
the movies where people have seen that

98
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,840
documentary hackers and they think

99
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what it's like in real life now</font>

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,160
in real<font color="#E5E5E5"> life in my day job my</font>

101
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,330
nine-to-five I'm a penetration tester

102
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,579
that's why I got into malicious software

103
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,550
i do<font color="#E5E5E5"> malicious software development not</font>

104
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,200
analysis the bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind development</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

105
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,430
find it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really fun it gives me a benefit</font>

106
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,739
in my day job when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> break into</font>

107
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,240
computers and buildings now when people

108
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to me about this and ask me</font>

109
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,770
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this they have clearly</font>

110
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,700
seen CSI cyber and they're clearly think

111
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:22,040
they're know how it works so Tekkit

112
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,800
engine will talk about the part of my

113
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,850
day job where I break<font color="#E5E5E5"> into buildings</font>

114
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,360
people ask me questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

115
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,159
it's a nice and

116
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,259
allergy because it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

117
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,810
problem so yesterday somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me</font>

118
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:34,669
what do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is my most effective</font>

119
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,930
disguise when I am doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a physical</font>

120
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:40,789
access assessment an employee what

121
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,050
scenario do you build up before you

122
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:47,659
break into a building that I work there

123
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,189
really it's not it's not these kind of

124
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:52,460
chap so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put on there a</font>

125
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:54,500
hat or those cool sunglasses and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

126
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,780
talk them aware through an overdeveloped

127
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,419
scenario I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk up to reception</font>

128
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,400
and start the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how I'm</font>

129
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,900
an engineer and i'm supposed to be there

130
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,388
and someone will vouch for me he's

131
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,679
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> matt honest the way that I do is</font>

132
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,379
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk around the office for a bit</font>

133
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,080
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal some stuff probably plug</font>

134
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,879
a raspberry pi into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer after all</font>

135
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,550
and the hacker but I don't look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

136
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,400
hacker and that's my benefit so no there

137
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:23,479
is no big scenario there is no disguises

138
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,888
I'm afraid in physical access mail may

139
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,659
not work how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it does in the</font>

140
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,889
same sense that antivirus<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail may not</font>

141
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,889
work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there where that you think it</font>

142
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">does but as a penetration tester that</font>

143
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:37,759
means I'm an ethical hacker sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

144
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:39,110
a hacktivist that's a hacker um I'm an

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,400
ethical hacker which means I break<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

146
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,190
buildings and computers I tell people

147
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,469
how i do it and a side effect of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

148
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,300
a really like malware I really like

149
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:50,029
malicious software I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

150
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,620
of malicious software is something

151
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,990
that's hung around for so long<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

152
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,330
it's a genuinely difficult problem both

153
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,680
in terms of how do we define malicious

154
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,659
and how can we do detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> ziff we</font>

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,639
don't understand malicious and also in

156
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,039
terms of the fact that there's an awful

157
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,300
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of competition in that market couple</font>

158
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,520
of reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've got</font>

159
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">next-generation antivirus and what</font>

160
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,539
they're called their competition which

161
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:13,550
is legacy antivirus and then we've also

162
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,960
got things like them trying to protect

163
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,520
their intellectual property so they're

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,438
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really going to disclose too much</font>

165
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,448
information about how their products

166
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,960
work potentially because they don't want

167
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:26,389
the competition to steal those ideas and

168
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,419
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> competition is pretty strong pretty</font>

169
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,099
complex and pretty weird to be honest so

170
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,750
next generation antivirus an example of

171
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,459
that is silence you may or may not have

172
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,839
heard of those you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably heard of</font>

173
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,849
software because they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for</font>

174
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,009
a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they're fit into the legacy</font>

175
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:43,039
category now silence

176
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:48,710
very recently had a little bit of lovers

177
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:51,279
TIFF and allegedly silence were<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm how</font>

178
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,938
did they put it well choreographing

179
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,939
demonstration so they were saying

180
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:57,649
silence<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus sauce here's a demo of</font>

181
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:59,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">sauce didn't pick up anything silence</font>

182
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:00,559
picked up everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore silence</font>

183
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,399
is better and you should buy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

184
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:05,990
sofas responded with well staging a

185
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,589
well-choreographed<font color="#E5E5E5"> battle of course</font>

186
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,379
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to win and allegedly</font>

187
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:14,449
silence disabled some required

188
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,830
protection some default protections in

189
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:17,509
the software's antivirus so when they

190
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,089
put them head-to-head silence had the

191
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,520
advantage silence responded with well

192
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:24,050
this has happened to was before legacy

193
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,609
AV vendors have done demonstrations with

194
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,999
our software that are purposely

195
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">misleading so we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

196
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:34,819
antivirus or rather we know that we

197
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,409
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need viruses malware so we try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

198
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,360
get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of protection mechanism</font>

199
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:40,789
but that black box protection systems we

200
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,919
install them and hope that their

201
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,419
protectors<font color="#E5E5E5"> the antivirus companies</font>

202
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,789
themselves are saying that they're not

203
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,198
because both sides of both arguments are

204
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:52,068
misleading in some way or another

205
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">allegedly so I don't get sued and so</font>

206
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:57,110
well what are we to do silence say the

207
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,909
only thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is to test the</font>

208
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,800
software ourselves and everyone in this

209
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:03,080
room's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phil</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Yemen that sounds good</font>

all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> software's I'll set up an</font>

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,399
aquarium like Holly did and people will

213
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,379
go nice fish however think about the

aspire to work with a lot of them less

tests and others we wouldn't have

222
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,990
the burden of proof is on the user are

the users really kitted out to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

kinds of tests well thankfully you don't

look at these systems and he has found

240

that not only are their vulnerabilities

241
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,449
in the antivirus themselves and that's a

242
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,670
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you install these</font>

in the so fail pepper was the fact that

266
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,380
in his opinion his words he didn't think

267
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,600
that the sophos research has really

268
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,550
understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cord was</font>

269
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,860
executing under and therefore when their

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,050
relative nature it was often<font color="#CCCCCC"> for unused</font>

271
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,280
or dead code so they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font>

272
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,199
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that'd make a nice signature</font>

273
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,120
will write a signature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up for</font>

274
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the antivirus writer can just</font>

275
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,460
go oh I'm not actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> using that code I</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just delete it signature goes away</font>

277
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,320
so antivirus supports two protectors

278
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,910
supposed to use algorithms and all kinds

279
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,990
of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff doesn't necessarily</font>

280
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,209
protect as if it's introducing

281
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,710
vulnerabilities we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how it</font>

282
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,240
works but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone looks into it it</font>

283
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,360
turns out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing a particularly</font>

284
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,860
good job of it so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said at the</font>

285
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning I set up the aquarium project</font>

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,710
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> suddenly found out that</font>

287
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,090
someone's already done it before me and

288
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,160
there's these websites out there where

289

you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it in exe and it will scan</font>

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,240
them for you so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font>

291
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,189
scanner scan that's out there you send

292
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
it in exe payload it'll run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

293
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,180
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you other it's malicious</font>

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,130
probably the most well-known one is

295
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,380
virustotal and the other virus 12 works

296
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,840
is two tabs there's the antivirus scans

297
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,670
where it will run 56 antivirus against

298
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,200
the exe and then the behavioral tab

299
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,910
which is its own product

300
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,820
run and tell you how the behavior works

301
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,350
and I took a look at a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them I'm</font>

302
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to pick up on anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

303
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular I'll probably talk more</font>

304
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,500
specifically at virustotal because from

305
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">my last talked I spoke to them and they</font>

306
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,730
responded to emails and things like that

307
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,710
however two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

308
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,800
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at doing today one of them is and</font>

309
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,270
why do my b-sides talk which is

310
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">effectively a complete bypass of the</font>

311
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,680
scanner engine and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side of the</font>

312
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">things I'm going to do is hey if these</font>

313
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,260
are on the internet and I give it an exe

314
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,229
and it runs it wouldn't it be incredibly

315
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,700
ironic if i put malware on it if you're

316
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">setting up a botnet and you send a</font>

317
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,120
player a SI tú command and control

318
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,860
botnet wouldn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really cool if you</font>

319
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
could put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these just the</font>

320
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,920
irony of when someone's like oh my god

321
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,360
there's a tack traffic coming in from

322
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,240
virus tall whoop so and so the way that

323
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it works is give them an exe the scan it</font>

324
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,120
will tell you if it's bad somewhere

325
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,770
where's really easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work out of its</font>

326
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,080
malware or not you know you upload

327
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,370
probably malware exe and it's like yeah

328
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,220
this is definitely malware because when

329
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,630
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it on our computer that happened</font>

330
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,280
yeah ransom<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty obvious ransomware</font>

331
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,830
is actually one of my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font>

332
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,720
happen to antivirus community because it

333
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,970
makes users aware that malware is a

334
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,620
problem users are just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nom and we</font>

335
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,830
just install like whatever comes with

336
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows and probably fine however we</font>

337
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">should look at these antivirus systems</font>

338
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,719
and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there protecting us are they</font>

339
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,310
doing a good job run somewhere is easy

340
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,680
to work out because it does that to your

341
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,849
desktop botnet herders and things like

342
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,130
that they're a little bit more subtle

343
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,270
like an employee techniques to basically

344
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,850
make it so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you're</font>

345
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,079
infected or not but starting at the

346
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,040
beginning of what I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> to virustotal</font>

347
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,040
and what I did to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other online</font>

348
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,719
scanners I found a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way in virustotal</font>

349
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,430
that I could extract information from

350
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,290
their system that would allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to</font>

351
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,969
accurately fingerprint they're scanning

352
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,709
engine well that allowed me to do was

353
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,840
write a piece of malware that knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

354
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,220
virustotal looks like and then it can

355
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,200
choose not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be malicious when it's in</font>

356
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that engine so the behavioral</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engine is</font>

357
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,370
looking for malicious behavior and then

358
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,130
the exe is just like oh this is a

359
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,110
scanner I'll pretend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good pretty</font>

360
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i contacted google and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was like</font>

361
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,720
hey google kind of found a vulnerability

362
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,969
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little bit weird to explain i</font>

363
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent him a really really long email that</font>

364
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,620
basically said i can extract information

365
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,600
from the system

366
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,820
I guess you would call it remote code

367
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,350
execution but it's by design of course

368
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,810
it's by design i give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exe it runs</font>

369
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,680
it that's the point of the product

370
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,699
probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of the product</font>

371
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,459
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to be able to extract information</font>

372
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">from it or that was my opinion so I said</font>

373
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,200
to them what I'm thinking is I upload an

374
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,520
exe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack scenario is that i</font>

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,380
can accurately fingerprint the

376
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,020
behavioral engine and therefore avoid

377
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,850
detection and<font color="#CCCCCC"> google send me a worthy</font>

378
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,410
email back you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at the</font>

379
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,390
back so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made it bigger and realize</font>

380
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,980
you'll still never read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

381
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,540
important part if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you minus out all the</font>

382
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,600
technical details is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and last</font>

383
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,010
line which is turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out this is working</font>

384
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,430
as intended what you've reported so far

385
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,380
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security vulnerability so we'll</font>

386
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,000
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> there we'll start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

387
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I can accurately fingerprint an</font>

388
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,560
antivirus engine and write a tool that

389
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,600
not only tells me which antivirus engine

390
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,770
a mitten but can actively avoid it

391
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,480
because it says this is a scanner

392
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,880
therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't be malicious we've</font>

393
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,470
seen attacks like this before the google

394
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,820
play store had a little bit of a problem

395
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,029
with malware because they were less

396
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,560
strict than the iOS App Store and in

397
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,450
what kind of applications they allowed

398
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,800
on and they just allowed anyone on so

399
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,470
obviously the malware developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

400
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,300
like wicked<font color="#CCCCCC"> well right load malware</font>

401
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,980
stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Store now google</font>

402
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,750
introduced a system called bouncer and

403
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,160
bouncer was a behavioral analysis engine

404
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,640
and it scanned apps as they were

405
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,900
uploaded excuse me and if they did

406
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,270
anything malicious it remove them from

407
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,010
the Play<font color="#CCCCCC"> Store so to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get on to the store</font>

408
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,230
you had to pass that behavior analysis

409
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,880
engine it took researchers approximately

410
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,490
five minutes to work out how to bypass

411
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,990
that system it's really trivial you just

412
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,580
don't do anything malicious whilst the

413
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,010
scan is running the scanner only runs

414
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,920
for five minutes you just do sleep five

415
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,319
minutes do malicious stuff and it's that

416
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,439
kind of attack I kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack that</font>

417
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,970
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at here so apparently I'm</font>

418
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,990
going to rant at you for the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

419
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,610
minutes about something that's not

420
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,529
vulnerability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the end of it</font>

421
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,260
you'll be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

422
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:16,080
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> goddamn it so start at the</font>

423
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,400
beginning and the ability to extract

424
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,410
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the scanner is</font>

425
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,880
apparently not a vulnerability so why

426
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,069
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent me</font>

427
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,230
from doing this if I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and extract the</font>

428
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name from the scanner it will</font>

429
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,640
replace what I extract with the word

430
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,450
user in angle brackets so it's picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

431
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,630
that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal some</font>

432
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,790
information and it's removing it now

433
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,860
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> spoke at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning about next</font>

435
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,320
wasn't complaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the word cyber</font>

436
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,660
as complaining about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry's</font>

437
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,790
requirement for everything to be cool

438
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,560
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't look at security unless</font>

439
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,810
it's cool it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zero day I don't</font>

440
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,930
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it problem and that is</font>

441
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:58,310
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the area of antivirus</font>

442
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,540
their versions are night if you don't

443
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,920
need to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of effort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

444
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,719
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to write assembly and do</font>

445
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,890
crazy things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that academics are</font>

446
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,550
doing that because they have to justify

447
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:09,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">phd's to justify it HT wasn't expecting</font>

a left there to justify a PhD<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

449
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,870
to show a significant contribution to

450
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">your field and I'll never get a PhD for</font>

451
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,440
this research because what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do is</font>

452
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,420
really naive and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight</font>

453
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,980
the fact that you can get effective

454
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,010
attacks against these systems doing

455
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,080
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trivial stuff so academics are</font>

456
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,660
doing things like looking at hardware

457
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,940
implementations of processors finding a

458
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,740
bug in the hardware implementation and

459
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,270
then comparing that to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

460
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,700
implementation and if the bug isn't

461
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,470
present it must be a virtual I system

462
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,180
scanners are virtualized therefore

463
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,740
there's a chance that you're in a vm or

464
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,719
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not vm like virustotal then</font>

465
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,350
potentially you're on a malware analysts

466
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,330
machine directly now implementing bugs

467
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,620
in code is a difficult thing and in fact

468
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,240
finding the books in the first place is

469
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,210
a difficult thing it's a really cool

470
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,650
technique for avoiding virtualization I

471
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,330
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do that what I did was</font>

472
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,220
extracted all of the information from

473
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,950
virustotal about their scanner and i'm

474
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,319
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> like username serial numbers</font>

475
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,780
files on the desktop stuff like that

476
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,129
attracted all of those and then just

477
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,920
wrote a signature and said if you see

478
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,449
these files you're on virus tall now if

479
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,589
you imagine for example if the running

480
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:20,240
user is cold virus total<font color="#CCCCCC"> so pretty</font>

481
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,770
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being scanned right now and</font>

482
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,390
it's that kind of technique that I'm

483
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing so I'm really sorry i'm not going</font>

484
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,630
to drop any zero days there's not going

485
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,330
to be slides filled with assembly

486
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,740
because you don't need it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

487
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,790
extract the<font color="#CCCCCC"> username and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there won't let</font>

488
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,500
me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need to obfuscate the username</font>

489
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,790
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a way that i can extract it</font>

490
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,170
without it realizing that it's the

491
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,340
username now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this could be something</font>

492
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool i could write my own</font>

493
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,570
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm and i could encrypt</font>

494
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,008
the payload and then when extra

495
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,200
I can decrypt a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-side they'll</font>

496
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:49,630
never see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that coming out or I can just</font>

497
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,169
like put space between upper lateral

498
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,299
reverse the string or best 64 it or and

499
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,070
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly user name isn't reflect by</font>

500
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:58,809
flagged user anymore it's the actual

501
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,519
user name that comes out the first

502
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,049
implementation I wrote our best 60

503
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,490
forward it and I pulled it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out best</font>

504
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,289
60-fold<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a python script to</font>

505
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,919
decode it for me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything like a</font>

506
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:09,879
shell<font color="#E5E5E5"> a virus toll that felt really cool</font>

507
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,960
still felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like too much effort so</font>

508
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,090
instead I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote a payload that</font>

509
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,320
changes it puts a full stop between

510
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,750
every letter and it comes out in the

511
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,340
interface directly so what kinds of

512
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,960
information was I flagging them on and

513
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,850
what kind of information do you need to

514
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,490
to look at to know that you're being

515
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,110
scanned by these kinds of systems not

516
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,639
spit not thinking specifically

517
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,019
virustotal but the kinds of scanners

518
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,699
that i have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> online the kind of ones</font>

519
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've talked about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usernames a</font>

520
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,539
really good one because the user name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

521
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,389
pretty unique another one is the

522
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:39,039
services that are running so any malware

523
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:41,110
analyst in fact there's an awful lot of

524
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,639
blog content out there about using

525
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,889
systems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> vmware and about using</font>

526
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:46,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">VirtualBox and hardening them in such a</font>

527
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:48,580
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that malware can't tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

528
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:50,500
virtualized so stripping all of the

529
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,759
little tokens out of the system in such

530
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,370
a way that the mower won't be able to

531
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,059
know that it's on vbox there didn't

532
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:59,439
bother with that just running<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

533
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,178
now when i first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started looking at the</font>

534
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,970
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was thinking about the</font>

535
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:05,500
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can do that right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

536
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,090
take a list of the running processes and

537
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,110
see if there's virustotal the exe on

538
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,759
there i'll see if there's anything like

539
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">vbox on there which is virtual boxes</font>

540

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,699
right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read running processes you need</font>

542
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,960
to be an administrator so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

545
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,309
blindly because i can't extract him

00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">information at this point and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did I</font>

found a privilege escalation venerable

amy was awesome and Exploited it and

549
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,820
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a new admin account and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

as admin anywhere you just wasted an

552
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:37,678
entire weekend so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turns out it's</font>

553
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:39,909
even more naive and I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was so</font>

554
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,169
pull out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> username that's unique pull</font>

out the running processes look for

anything that looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

virtualized this is actually a reduced

list as a few more in there i'll give

559

you hints but vbox tray and vbox service

560
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,370
are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good indicator that you're on</font>

561
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,299
VirtualBox then take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the</font>

562
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">system and see if there's any other</font>

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,200
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were crying have written</font>

implemented the existence of files is a

573
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,860
good indicator that we're virtualized

574
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,300
especially of one of them's like c

575

program files virus toilet or something

576

like that but also take a look on the on

577
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,610
the desktop check look in the documents

578
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see if there's unique files there</font>

579
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,550
take a look at the uptime of the system

580
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,500
I mean you would think that these nodes

581
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,020
as you send an exe up you think the node

582
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,280
would be spun up<font color="#CCCCCC"> its scan the exe if you</font>

583
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,010
spun down so you're up time to be like

584
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,660
seven seconds or something just

585
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,310
inhumanly short it's not turns out it's

586
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">like four years no idea what's going on</font>

587
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but it's another unique signature</font>

588
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can pick up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on we can take a</font>

589
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,909
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the scanning nodes take a</font>

590
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the time of the mall and see if</font>

591
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,880
it matches so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can flag on these</font>

592
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,190
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can extract this</font>

593
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,470
information I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it into my exe</font>

594
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:59,280
and my exe can be built in such<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're so</font>

595
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,960
that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it runs on my desktop it just</font>

596
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,000
the attack payload thing and when it

597
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,520
runs on<font color="#E5E5E5"> virustotal it does something</font>

598
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">else can I cool tools like this where</font>

599
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,320
whenever an IT admins scans the files

600
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:14,850
see if it's malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets what I want</font>

601
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,010
out of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can lie to the admin and</font>

602
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,929
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple and that's why I</font>

603
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,240
did it besides also i showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> there where</font>

604
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,650
you run executable and we can lie<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

605
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,880
scanner and puts the behavioral tab

606
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,680
instead of showing what's actually

607
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,170
happening this is mimicked at that's

608
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,940
running by the way i wrote a rapper<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

609
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,040
sits around many cats and and does this

610
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,210
technique instead of running member cats

611
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,610
and being really<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious to the user</font>

612
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,830
they'll just display any message that I

613
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,810
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's the social engineering</font>

614
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,310
moment where you can be like totally not

615
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,690
malware txt but now that I can do this I

616
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,399
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of awesome I can</font>

617
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,870
weaponize this and release this as a

618
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,970
cyber tool and I'll get a conference

619
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,189
talk and everyone I'll clap and that's

620
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,510
cool and the weather they extract this

621
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,830
information for anyone who knows these

622
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,600
scanners I did it through the front end

623
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,590
through the behavioral tab itself you

624
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,530
can pull any information out that way

625
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,760
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things i wanted to do</font>

626
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,170
whilst is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system was take a</font>

627
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,250
look at some of the file content and

628
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,310
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awkward because there's</font>

629
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,780
loads of it so part of another way that

630
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">i could extract information would be to</font>

631
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">just use</font>

632
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,890
or socket calls so instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pulling</font>

633
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,899
out through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front end I can</font>

634
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,059
effectively go out the back end now you

635
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,860
would think in this context now it would

636
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:22,408
be strictly firewalled and would be

637
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,750
filtering you know oh what's that term

638
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:26,700
did a loss prevention that's another

639
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">another side before that loss prevention</font>

640
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,690
would prevent these kinds of attacks and

641
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,949
well yeah you'd also think the uptime

642
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,429
would be like seven seconds and we were

643
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:37,020
wrong there so getting it through the

644
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:39,000
front end is pretty simple up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> scared</font>

645
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the output it comes straight out getting</font>

646
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,770
it through the back end well you can

647
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:47,610
play around with it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit jump my</font>

648
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:48,658
slides forwards to this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and play it</font>

649
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,309
through the back end you need to work

650
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,110
out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports are open so just write a</font>

651
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,270
payload<font color="#CCCCCC"> that checks every pore in turn</font>

652
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,250
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to a server that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we control</font>

653
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,309
and every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> pot if one of them is</font>

654
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:02,039
open you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that one try and TCP</font>

655
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:03,539
and UDP then you can try things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

656
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,559
handling I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

657
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,330
presume some people in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

658
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,840
little less penetration testing than

659
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,129
other people so network sockets we

660
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,408
should all know those just make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> role</font>

661
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,940
connection on<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS fun along the way</font>

662
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:16,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this works if you're unfamiliar is</font>

663
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,169
you do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lookup for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a server that you</font>

664
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,850
control so attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm whatever</font>

665
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,960
website you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you'll put the</font>

666
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,428
payload the information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

a subdomain then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just check the logs of</font>

669
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:30,390
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server you'll see it paying so</font>

670
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,929
DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> son leagues a pretty simple way of</font>

671
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:36,169
doing it we've got an ICP<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crow request</font>

672
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:39,120
as well that's one way of doing it so

673
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">ICP echo request tunneling through a</font>

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,110
ping basically for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those are unfamiliar</font>

675
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,179
you can read loads and loads of

676
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,479
documentation on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing it's</font>

677
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,789
like oh man packets and stuff and bits I

678
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,059
don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of this but data</font>

679
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:56,309
optional that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> good debtor</font>

680
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,720
optional so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like 30 bytes of</font>

681
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,520
data into every ping packet and then i

682
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,169
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just ping my server run wireshark on</font>

683
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,179
my server and every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pen comes</font>

684
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,919
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can smuggle data and the back</font>

686
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,630
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool hit 30 bites at a time which</font>

687
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:12,510
isn't a lot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fairness send as many</font>

688
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,679
things as you want so sneaking

689
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,270
information out through the front end

690
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,030
sneaking information out through raw TCP

691
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:20,970
sockets smuggling it out through DNS and

692
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:23,280
ICMP the last one is UDP hole punching

693
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,029
UDP hole punching is a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> world of</font>

694
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,960
weird

695
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:30,719
and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the weather UDP hole</font>

696
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,570
punching works is you have two servers

697
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:35,159
behind that so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the virus hole or</font>

698
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,379
the scanner that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to target</font>

699
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,179
and then is your machine somewhere in

700
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:41,639
the internet on your bt home hub

701
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,919
connection whatever you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

702
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:46,709
the two systems to fire UDP traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

703
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,109
each other and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see we have this</font>

704
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing we have stare full firewalls step</font>

705
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:52,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">4 firewall sound cool and what they do</font>

706
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:54,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">is their track connections so a TCP</font>

707
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,639
connection comes in is see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

708
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,499
authorized and if it is it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

709
00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:00,059
and the return traffic comes back and

710
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:02,210
it's like yet that matches this is a

711
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:06,119
connection this is allowed apart from

712
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,440
UDP is a connectionless protocol so the

713
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,330
stateful firewall can't track

714
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,700
connections because there aren't any

715
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,379
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic in each direction so</font>

716
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,129
if you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your payload running on virus</font>

717
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:19,289
tall to just keep firing traffic at<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

718
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:21,658
home router and you get a client on your

719
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:23,549
home router to keep firing traffic at

720
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,099
the target scanner eventually the

721
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:28,229
firewall go looks like these two things

722
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:30,059
are trying to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each other i'ma</font>

723
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:32,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">let that through and it just lets it</font>

724
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,479
through so it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit like</font>

725
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,919
magic and there's a firewall engineer

726
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:36,349
who works in my office who still doesn't

727
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,119
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that this as possible I</font>

728
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:41,399
didn't invent this this is a thing that

729
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,658
exists and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually an</font>

730
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,580
implementation of it done by Samy Kamkar

731
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,080
if anyone wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up a just a</font>

732
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,519
working implementation of this kind of

733
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,320
thing because that's the thing you see

734
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,409
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> write malware we do these kinds</font>

735
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,658
of attacks you'll see Mel<font color="#CCCCCC"> lionel</font>

736
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:56,339
analysis online like kaspersky labs and

00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,679
people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pulling malware apart</font>

738
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:00,178
and being like oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> this malware is</font>

739
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,129
terrible it's written in the most naive

740
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,049
of where's he's just stolen<font color="#CCCCCC"> cord from</font>

00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">all over the place this is basically</font>

742
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:08,849
made from stack overflow two things to

743
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:12,239
say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the first is all software</font>

744
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:14,639
is made from stack overflow if you want

745
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:17,099
to have if you want to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

746
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,769
effective dos attack in the world tech

747
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:21,539
stack overflow down and no work will get

748
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,290
done you'll probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> write the economy</font>

749
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,360
off that'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hilarious</font>

750
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,670
and so all quarters run from stack

751
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,320
overflow and beings like that and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

752
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,790
when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a look at my b-sides</font>

753
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,950
talks and I'm sitting in the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

754
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:35,020
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing these Packers I don't want</font>

755
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,970
to write an implementation of a yes so

756
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,980
I'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go snack / floor a yes</font>

757
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,960
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> that copy and paste into my</font>

malware send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the internet and</font>

759
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,380
that totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> works I told a friend in</font>

760
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,600
the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and he was like no</font>

761
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,350
this cannot possibly be true<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

762
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,629
downloaded an example ransomware from

763
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,530
the internet send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to virustotal it</font>

764
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,060
was like yeah this is definitely

765
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,620
ransomware I've seen this<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it's</font>

766
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,080
like encrypted my desktop and all sorts

767
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,030
and then he downloaded an example of the

768
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">T encryption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm wrapped the</font>

769
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:07,720
ransomware and that fight that up and

770
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">got no hits it's like wow um malware is</font>

771
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,540
copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> paste and we're done and yet it is</font>

772
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,730
so we see all of these library reports

773
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,080
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> out saying this this malware is</font>

774
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,750
trivial and it was written from stack

775
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,399
overflow don't concentrate on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't</font>

776
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,570
concentrate on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view where</font>

777
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,520
were like if it doesn't include<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

778
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:27,939
zero-day it's not cool concentrate on

779
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,889
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> then monetize it and did they make a</font>

780
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,350
profit so look at crypto wall

781
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,910
cryptolocker things like that allegedly

782
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,240
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two male has made three million</font>

783
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:39,250
dollars and 18 million dollars each that

784
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,510
is crazy money you could literally buy

785
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,420
an island and hollow out a volcano

786
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,590
volcano for that kind of money and then

787
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,150
you see the analysis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font>

788
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,320
artists is really trivial and this

789
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,970
developer clearly doesn't have a clue

790
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,240
what he's on about well maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

791
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,950
need to so jump in back to where we were

792
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,300
if if you take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at systems like</font>

793
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,490
these online scanning engines and you

794
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,230
can upload a tool to them they'll

795
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,750
fingerprint the fact that it's a

796
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,830
scanning engine you'll see that there's

797
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,540
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nodes on there</font>

798
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,280
obviously and for the sake of my own

799
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,909
sanity unnamed the node so I could work

800
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,960
out what is on which not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as on and and</font>

801
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:14,320
then I tried lots of different

802
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,460
techniques tcp UDP UDP hole punch in all

803
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,500
kinds of stuff to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get traffic</font>

804
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,390
back from the scanner node to the

805
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet the reason that I was doing</font>

806
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,850
this was just exfiltrate data but I had

807
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,680
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a think if you have this</font>

808
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,419
level of control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over these scanning</font>

809
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,370
engines and you know that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

810
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,690
scanning engine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get to the</font>

811
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,889
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate with</font>

812
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,890
servers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

813
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,059
be the best place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a command and</font>

814
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,649
control server for a botnet because

815
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:44,350
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got full control coming out of</font>

816
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,820
what they did what the data is so yeah

817
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,428
when it comes to antivirus version

818
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,840
there's an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

819
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:52,090
out there the academics are doing some

820
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,260
crazy stuff when it comes to actually

821
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,590
what you need to do to pull an attack

822
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,059
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really naive take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

823
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,439
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are up there taking a look at</font>

824
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:01,990
the way that traffic's filtered it's

825
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,550
probably not effectively filtered right

826
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,780
and proof of concepts like this sending

827
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">it into the vendors and then the vendors</font>

828
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,700
like yeah now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is all right</font>

829
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:11,889
actually turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is working as</font>

830
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,840
intended and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it is but I</font>

831
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,370
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is wider than that one</font>

832
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,649
scanner that is looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at I think that</font>

833
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:20,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is our fixation as an</font>

834
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,990
information security community on things

835
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:25,870
being cool start off a slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 weaponize</font>

836
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,400
cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 des take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at slide 10</font>

837
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,020
where were like yeah man<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> copied</font>

838
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,960
and pasted some code we've got wider

839
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,700
problems in the community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm really</font>

840
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry for renting at you for 30 minutes</font>

841
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,840
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to virustotal and</font>

842
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,040
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> not dropping any zero days but i</font>

843
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,809
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's some problems with</font>

844
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,030
antivirus evasion stuff and I think we

845
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:45,030
should fix it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

846
00:29:50,400 --> 00:30:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh questions go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead yeah so there's</font>

847
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,430
two ways to do that and I saw a post

848
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,900
somebody but I think wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter in</font>

849
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,880
fact they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were like why don't we just</font>

850
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">spin up loads of processes cold like</font>

851
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Reeboks and cold like semantic go exe</font>

852
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and stuff like that and then malware</font>

853
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,900
will avoid that and that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get</font>

854
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of the arms rest well</font>

855
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,180
yeah the malware totally would avoid

856
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,650
that this generation of malware would

857
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,440
avoid it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the next generation</font>

858
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,760
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better so I think yeah I think</font>

859
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,680
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at antivirus and</font>

860
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,020
be like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working just lying in</font>

861
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,700
demos is not the way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I've got</font>

862
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,960
algorithms and next interaction stuff

863
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,820
coming out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds really cool</font>

864
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,460
well yeah maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should take the the</font>

865
00:30:47,820 --> 00:31:09,120
naivety and fire it back at<font color="#CCCCCC"> their the</font>

866
00:30:50,460 --> 00:31:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">enemy anyone else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh so even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though we</font>

867
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,280
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get caught first time around</font>

868
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,280
interesting news comes up again again

869
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,590
yeah and so the point was a virus total

870
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,850
keep signatures keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> exe s in their</font>

871
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,949
entirety and it will release them to

872
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">people yes it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does it'll share them</font>

873
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,390
between antivirus vendors and also it

874
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,939
holds 12 them indefinitely so Stuxnet

875
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,590
was uploaded a virus toll in like 2007

876
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,850
allegedly and no one paid any attention

877
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,620
to it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one knew what it was</font>

878
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,330
but when it became interesting and we

879
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,159
had fingerprints for its behavior

880
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,810
somebody looked back through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the API was</font>

881
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,280
like oh that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Stuxnet we can</font>

882
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,659
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you are a malware</font>

883
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,660
developer please turn yourself in to the

884
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,740
police they're just outside and but yeah

885
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,280
if you want playing around with these

886
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,720
techniques do be aware of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there</font>

887
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,190
are systems out there that don't share

888
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,450
samples but still I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help</font>

889
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that because that's bad stuff I</font>

890
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">am blue team although I'm a penetration</font>

891
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,850
tester I do like defensive stuff

892
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:09,169
highlighting problems

893
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:09,168
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix them anyone else go ahead</font>

894
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:17,730
kill so the proposed fixes for the

895
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:21,240
problems no it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really good</font>

896
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">question actually because you think the</font>

897
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,690
antivirus community that the vendors

898
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,820
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at this and I'm sure</font>

899
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,200
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and next generation a virus has</font>

900
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,760
come out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem has been</font>

901
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,590
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it</font>

902
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,500
and they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithms so it's</font>

903
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:36,030
like I don't know throw AI and machine

904
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,250
learning up in the air and catch what

905
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,500
lens and that's what they're going for I

906
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,090
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the naive stuff we need to look at</font>

907
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work that's already been done and</font>

908
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,260
implemented so the fact that i can and

909
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,850
fingerprint what the virtualization

910
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,860
system is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the scanners are using</font>

911
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,389
there's already fixes for that ask any

912
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,129
malware analysts how they've set up

913
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,450
their role<font color="#E5E5E5"> and system it will be</font>

914
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,220
hardened against those kinds of attacks

915
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,559
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scanners should be</font>

916
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,539
hardened to maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

917
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,520
code review I don't know hollow Travis

918
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,169
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday on Twitter not me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because he</font>

919
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,299
rants an awful lot more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

920
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:08,370
that legacy antivirus works and what we

921
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,360
should do there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically take a</font>

922
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:15,020
look at research that's already been

923
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,020
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and implement it on its back</font>

924
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,760
because it breaks stuff so why is an app

925
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,830
Locker<font color="#CCCCCC"> and email rolled out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> white more</font>

926
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,179
widely it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it breaks stuff</font>

927
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,820
that's the problem how many how many

928
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:31,110
times if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work to the company and the</font>

929
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">antivirus is pinged one too many times</font>

930
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:36,449
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've turned it off false positives</font>

931
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,129
are really bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the antivirus world if</font>

932
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,490
your antivirus is loud people will

933
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:44,220
disable it so that sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really</font>

934
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry blend normal computer users not me</font>

935
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,289
and emits great though an email and

936
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,030
protections like<font color="#CCCCCC"> applica should be</font>

937
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:53,760
rolled out because they'll block things

938
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">like ransomware and although ransomware</font>

939
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,900
was first released in 1989 I don't think

940
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it became</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a massive problem until</font>

941
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,210
recently I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to blend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin for</font>

942
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:05,760
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to monetize the attacks</font>

943
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,200
is is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really made ransomware come</font>

944
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,589
about and now that users are getting hit

945
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,480
by it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet worse yet ethical</font>

946
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:13,759
difficulties the fact that hospitals are

947
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,168
getting hit by it

948
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,000
now that it's actually causing a

949
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact it's not just geeks or</font>

950
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,060
concentrating on its normal people who

951
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:21,918
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into it and I think that</font>

952
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of thing will lead to a wider</font>

953
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:39,908
deployment of a man up<font color="#E5E5E5"> locker to looking</font>

954
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:42,260
at you again go ahead yes very hard and

955
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:44,360
well and just because the problems hard

956
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,490
doesn't mean we should avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

957
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,169
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nave stuffs really easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

958
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:50,299
have unique files on your machine don't

959
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,069
have a unique user names I mean they're

960
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,750
already scrambling the MAC addresses for

961
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,490
example every time the node comes up it

962
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,650
gets a unique MAC address those kinds of

963
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,180
things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy to do what's</font>

964
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,710
difficult to fix is what the academics

965
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:06,529
are looking at so things like causing

966
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,500
finding bugs in VMware and<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtualbox</font>

967
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that'll cause crashes for example</font>

968
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,640
finding bugs in the implementation so

969
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,930
VMware can talk to the host you can

970
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,029
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> information between not talking</font>

971
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,160
GSXR here<font color="#CCCCCC"> by talking vmware work session</font>

972
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,900
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the host so the malware</font>

973
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,000
can attempt to talk to the horse thief

974
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,270
that connections open you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do things</font>

975
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,560
like seeing what bios features are

976
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,720
available and try and communicate with

977
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,920
those if the system advertises a feature

978
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,600
is available but you can't communicate

979
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,040
to it it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's lying</font>

980
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,770
and it's a virtualized environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

981
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,480
mentioned during the talk is and bugs

982
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist in hardware because hardware</font>

983
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,620
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> imperfect see if those exist in the</font>

984
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:45,440
software implementations but those kinds

985
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:48,109
of things as hard as they<font color="#CCCCCC"> artifex are</font>

986
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,380
also harder to write a tool that detects

987
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:53,000
them so with information security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

988
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,830
with penetration testing kinds of things

989
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,600
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time we just were just</font>

990
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,340
increasing the height of the speed bump

991
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,440
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad thing</font>

992
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,570
if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from naivety and</font>

993
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,670
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult problem then that's</font>

994
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,140
good so yes sadly a lot of these fixes

995
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,350
are harder to implement but we should

996
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,799
totally do it oh I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

997
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,799
time three

998
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:46,890
yeah it's true and and publishing the

999
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,089
techniques is a funny line that we have

1000
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,799
to draw<font color="#E5E5E5"> are as red teamers as well</font>

1001
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:51,359
because whenever we release a tool it

1002
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:53,069
should benefit blue team more than it

1003
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,990
benefits red team so if I come here and

1004
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:56,460
I do a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is really easy</font>

1005
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,919
and it shouldn't be easy that's quite

1006
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,809
bad but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I enter the end of the day</font>

1007
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,029
with yeah here's a full proof of concept

1008
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:04,589
of how this works then I just slender

1009
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:06,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">the speed bump right down it's</font>

1010
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,099
absolutely right we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

1011
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:10,109
return on investment but we're at right

1012
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,259
now with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these scanners need to</font>

1013
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:28,019
be just a little bit higher do you have

1014
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:29,819
question and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what</font>

1015
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:31,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">the botnet her does it not someone I</font>

1016
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:33,150
heard us do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> teams need to look at</font>

1017
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,288
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the botnet track as adding and one</font>

1018
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,140
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things the botnet trackers will</font>

1019
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:39,720
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they'll spin up a virtual machine</font>

1020
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,160
infect it with malware on the hopes that

1021
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will become a super node or become an</font>

1022
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,578
important node in the botnet so they can

1023
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">extract more information about the</font>

1024
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,910
tracker and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their do things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1025
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,618
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll set a wallpaper and they'll</font>

1026
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">make messy files on the desktop and</font>

1027
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,980
things and they've got videos of the

1028
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:55,140
botnet herders logging in having a poke

1029
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,670
around manually human taking a poke

1030
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,200
around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems to see fits in use or</font>

1031
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,299
not and yeah when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at that level</font>

1032
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,549
we're really good we're really hard if

1033
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:05,630
you can't differentiate between it is a

1034
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:08,489
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> or is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an analyst but I think</font>

1035
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:10,499
for the most part the problem with

1036
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:14,099
saying if this machine doesn't look like

1037
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:16,680
it's in use by human then I presume<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1038
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,849
virtualized the problem there is how do

1039
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it's in use by a human</font>

1040
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:20,609
there's a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look out</font>

1041
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,380
for does it have a mouse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyboard</font>

1042
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:24,119
plugged in does it was sound card for

1043
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,009
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all non virtualized</font>

1044
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,329
machines will have a sound card but past

1045
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:29,220
that in terms of things like mouse

1046
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:31,910
movements idle time things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1047
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,910
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

1048
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,669
filed it sometimes is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at</font>

1049
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,990
in this context actually and like i said

1050
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,580
the scanners that eyes looking at and

1051
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,649
naively presumed the uptime would be

1052
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,180
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just spin a node up</font>

1053
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,090
and scan it and it wasn't it was years

1054
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,560
and over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there had been filed</font>

1055
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,180
behavior I don't know maybe they're

1056
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,009
cloning the systems or something and

1057
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,240
there's this year's worth of activity

1058
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,500
but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely right there's</font>

1059
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">years worth of activity but there's no</font>

1060
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:04,720
activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last week for example</font>

1061
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:06,040
yeah yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those kinds of things</font>

1062
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:20,290
would be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to defend</font>

1063
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:21,759
against but we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> there yet bad yeah</font>

1064
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">virus halt was written a long time ago</font>

1065
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,109
it was acquired by Google after it is a

1066
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,930
Google product but they didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1067
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:31,150
and so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of it is probably the fact</font>

1068
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the tool written an awful long time</font>

1069
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,840
ago and it works you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

1070
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of we implement security after the</font>

1071
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,980
fact it might have just been that and

1072
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,290
also sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> as winter Billy's I mean</font>

1073
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,700
we see all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time don't we news</font>

1074
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,890
iredale come out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> avenel panic</font>

1075
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,939
heartbleed for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow ha bleed we</font>

1076
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,230
need to patch in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next eight hours</font>

1077
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,060
otherwise the world's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> self fire</font>

1078
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,190
and then someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks sounds like guys</font>

1079
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,930
this has been here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like two years I</font>

1080
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,180
think it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if no</font>

1081
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,919
one's really done this before or if no

1082
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,868
one's done this and then talked about it

1083
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,849
then maybe that's why they haven't fixed

1084
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:02,440
it I think specifically why they say

1085
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:03,790
this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security vulnerability in</font>

1086
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,000
the emails where I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them</font>

1087
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:11,140
is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're it's a language issue</font>

1088
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,250
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it isn't a security</font>

1089
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,980
vulnerability because remote code

1090
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:17,140
execution is by design but it is a risk

1091
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,369
to users because users use the system to

1092
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,440
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some things malicious and I'm</font>

1093
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:22,330
lying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

1094
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">tripped up on terminology here i'm not</font>

1095
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not saying like oh this is a</font>

1096
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,740
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> vulnerability and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1097
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">be like a patch to fix a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying it's</font>

1098
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,729
kind of broken by design because every

1099
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,500
time i come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a new where of</font>

1100
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,790
obfuscating debtor and pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

1101
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the system you could say oh we could</font>

1102
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,700
block that we could block that we could

1103
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,400
block that and then we're back to the

1104
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,529
arms rest problem so it doesn't have to

1105
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:46,820
be perfect but where it is right now is

1106
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:48,500
pretty trivial oh oh go ahead

1107
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,030
so I just quickly do you think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

1108
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,410
have more success with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google if you</font>

1109
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:55,100
framed it as more of an information

1110
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,120
disclosure<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of I did I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did am so why</font>

1111
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,589
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there was just the last</font>

1112
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,589
paragraph where I talk about the attack

1113
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,780
scenario the full email was huge and it

1114
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,000
started out with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> explanation of what</font>

1115
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,250
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that the vulnerability is and</font>

1116
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,750
that's why I have the scenarios and

1117
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,220
quite accurately defining a scenario

1118
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,020
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> code execution I'm talking</font>

1119
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">about its debt or exfiltration and they</font>

1120
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,620
also give them samples like I can get

1121
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,569
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> direct get that debtor out things</font>

1122
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,279
like that and but yeah I think the

1123
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is god it's that bug bounty</font>

1124
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,640
problem isn't it where if you have a

1125
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,830
managed book value then to the guys who

1126
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">are tracking it and understand the</font>

1127
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,400
issues and if you have someone who does

1128
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,990
understand the issues do they understand

1129
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,300
the terminology the talking to people

1130
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,279
side of things and it's a bit of a weird

1131
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:40,870
vulnerability that might be why it

1132
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:59,270
hasn't been addressed anyone else know

1133
00:41:40,870 --> 00:42:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um ah no don't try that and no you</font>

1134
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,880
couldn't because the system is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1135
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,669
really small which is why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1136
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,950
it as I see two and because it's it's a

1137
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:10,160
really low powerful low power machine

1138
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,060
low bandwidth and but yeah god that

1139
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,620
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really weird</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't if</font>

1140
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,620
someone actually did that don't do that

1141
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:21,580
cool anymore before we go go right back

1142
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,509
to then on Heather word kill Chen<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1143
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">decided</font>

1144
00:42:49,809 --> 00:43:05,979
so just stop normal users yeah God<font color="#E5E5E5"> 054</font>

1145
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,098
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a slide for this I</font>

1146
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:11,259
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> can and the way that I Hugh</font>

1149
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,660
I'm a penetration tester I break into

1150
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:18,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">computers for a living I attack over the</font>

internet which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably arguably</font>

1152
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:22,630
where most attacks come from and I can

1153
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:23,979
do cyber zero-day attacks and do sequel

1154
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,329
injection into your servers but

1155
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:28,718
hopefully because sequel injection

1156
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:29,920
camera in 1998 you fixed that so the

1157

<font color="#E5E5E5">next one down will do from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in terms</font>

of effort level of the attacker is a

fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> camp an ad efficient campaigns</font>

1160
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:39,939
all the time I don't send an email to a

1161
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:41,289
user like hey what's your password

1162
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:42,969
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's going to fall for that</font>

1163
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:44,529
I send a subtle campaign with the

1164
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:47,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lincoln generally click this link it</font>

1165
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:49,180
will prompt a login box fifty percent of

1168
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:54,969
these things that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not garner</font>

1169
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:57,910
statistics that's just what I do at work

1170
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:59,679
and if that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work if somehow</font>

1171
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:01,449
you've managed to fix the phishing email

1172
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,029
problem because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't don't think</font>

1173
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyone specs not yet I'll just break</font>

1174
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:07,779
into the building benefit of wrecking

1175
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,429
the building is I don't dress like a

1176
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:13,719
ninja I don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like lava and</font>

1177
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:15,880
a dot on an anonymous mask so people

1178
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">just let me in I think in terms of quick</font>

1179
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,400
wins from a cyber point of view from a

1180
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:23,319
computer point of view is take a look at

1181
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,209
your monitoring and is it all on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1182
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:27,219
perimeter because the permit doesn't

1183
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:29,279
necessarily exist anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> so think of</font>

1184
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:31,869
attack vectors like rubber duckies it's

1185
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:33,789
12 key prices to compromise a laptop if

1186
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,439
it's unencrypted if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can either plug</font>

1187
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:37,449
something in or get a user to plug

1188
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:39,219
something in that's a massive threat and

1189
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:42,489
the problem with that threat is it's a

1190
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:44,410
low difficulty to exploit so stop stop

1191
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:45,910
worrying so much about what Nash instead

1192
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,428
hackers can do and start worrying<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1193
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:52,328
what users can do to their own machines

1194
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:55,980
if someone gives them a USB and also

1195
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:59,440
probably hire some armed guards

1196
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:04,020
probably that was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing see how</font>

1197
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,020
I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> away with that yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 go ahead</font>

1198
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:26,890
it's really contact specific with VPNs

1199
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,359
because to me a VPN is just a tunnel so

1200
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,980
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're arbitrarily extending the</font>

1201
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:32,740
perimeter so say for example V painting

1202
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:35,020
from a user's end device then the

1203
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,060
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets really complex because the</font>

1204
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,410
end device is a company device and you

1205
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,670
can lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> that down you can monitor it</font>

1206
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,368
you have your own endpoint protection on

1207
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:45,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it or is it a BYOD policy where the</font>

1208
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:47,890
users got their own machine I think the

1209
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem doesn't get doesn't change all</font>

1210
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,910
that much all you've done is

1211
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:53,470
geographically move the perimeter if a

1212
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,180
user can still plug a USB device in

1213
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,830
every user can still click a link<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

1214
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:01,149
phishing email we've not really made any

1215
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:02,350
progress so antivirus is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right the</font>

1216
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,790
fact that any virus only<font color="#E5E5E5"> picks up</font>

1217
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,880
seventy percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the threats is that</font>

1218
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:09,430
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> semantic said something like that</font>

1219
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,080
fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> God shouldn't be a problem</font>

1220
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">shouldn't be a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that antivirus</font>

1221
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,359
only picks up fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1222
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,900
threats because our defensive

1223
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,520
technologies is not just any virus about

1224
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,250
antivirus systems antivirus isn't the

1225
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,050
front line it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin one in front</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1226
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,940
hedge q they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have broken through</font>

1227
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,680
so much stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to that the fact</font>

1228
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,630
that a user can click a link or plug a

1229
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,270
USB device in or be coerced over the

1230
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,830
phone is a problem and your perimeter is

1231
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:35,290
nowhere near as deep as you think is I

1232
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:37,630
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the VPN issue is so much of</font>

1233
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:41,200
a problem VPNs<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop me using wireshark</font>

1234
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:42,580
that's it I don't know any attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1235
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,049
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses that kind of technique</font>

1236
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,420
unless you're in starbucks and you're

1237
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:53,599
bored<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then be fans are good</font>

1238
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:57,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyone else awesome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks guys</font>

1239
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,309
that was 45 minutes
