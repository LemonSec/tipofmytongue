00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
hello my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Chris Ratcliffe and</font>

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,350
today I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a talk called</font>

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,989
Vorsprung durch Technik otherwise known

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,370
as ye cars I'll hackable and hacking

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,839
them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun and profit little bit of</font>

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,720
background about me I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional for about a decade but I've</font>

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a lifelong car fam anybody who</font>

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,619
follows<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter this is what I</font>

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,279
look like on there this is what I look

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,729
like in real life<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I Drive racing cars</font>

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">i drive my car on track i drive other</font>

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:39,510
people's car on track I take photos of

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,070
cars on track I talk awkwardly on

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube while driving other people's</font>

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,149
cars so today I'm doing one of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the other and this this is my car</font>

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,430
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what has been really</font>

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,090
instrumental over the past three or four

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,440
years about learning what makes up all

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,270
the car systems aren't going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,309
about today I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,380
learnt all about the 15 control units in

24
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,509
the car all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different buses the</font>

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,640
protocols the messaging formats all of

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of stuff by decompiling</font>

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,439
firmware by probing the buses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font>

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,460
have you I didn't I googled it and found

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,970
BMW tech are you great them out all the

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,619
cars all this stuff ends up online you

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">can tell this actually a training manual</font>

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,079
from a dealer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because at the end of each</font>

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,610
chapter it's got review questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

34
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,949
also old enough to remember when car

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,450
security wasn't about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it</font>

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,159
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually about stopping a car</font>

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,899
getting stolen we had things like these

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,880
primary requirements for these warm

39
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,880
paint it yellow to<font color="#E5E5E5"> misspell lock</font>

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,550
we then moved on so we then had trackers

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,500
we then had aftermarket alarms we had

42
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,610
fobs that would cycle through code so if

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,230
you make press it in the pub you

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,630
couldn't get into your car and but we've

45
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,000
now moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> on from simple after marking</font>

46
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,359
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> to massively connected really</font>

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,950
integrated cars before we go on I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,360
set up a few conventions so first of all

49
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,780
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> two car manufacturers are the same</font>

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,120
and often no two cars from any one

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,040
manufacturer are the same either so I

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,300
can't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this will always be</font>

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,640
connected into this which will always<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

54
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,590
connecting to this it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every</font>

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,369
car starts with a new piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of paper and</font>

56
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,090
a whole new idea about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work it</font>

57
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,530
the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm going to talk</font>

58
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the car's computer system cars</font>

59
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,340
massively variable some are very

60
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated some of some are very</font>

61
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,900
straightforward some are very well

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,100
integrated some are very distributed

63
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,010
something's can refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it is the car</font>

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,810
computer and in fact it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

65
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,269
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font>

66
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,080
far cars have come this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a wiring</font>

67
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,610
diagram from an original 70s mini and

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,269
those of you who know your electronics

69
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,769
will see relays and buttons<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things</font>

70
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,190
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this actually connects</font>

71
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,930
into the engine in two places one for

72
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,120
the starter motor and one for the

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,470
alternator and everything else was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,780
of stand alone by comparison this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

75
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,830
diagram for the traction<font color="#CCCCCC"> control system</font>

76
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,750
on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> car I wanted to get the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

77
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,959
diagram the whole wiring diagram for the

78
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,630
car<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it only exists on a DVD and it</font>

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,380
will only show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one portion at a time</font>

80
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:39,930
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one system of many on a car</font>

81
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,799
and it hooks into both control systems

82
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:47,600
into hydraulic units into dashboard all

83
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,590
sorts the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes this work</font>

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,930
thing that connects all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

85
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,360
disparate systems together is thing

86
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,890
called can or can bus you've probably

87
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard it because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one thing that</font>

88
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:03,529
people often talk about but what is it

89
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:07,340
no its controller area network it's a

90
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:11,630
serial bus really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple messages</font>

91
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:14,240
go on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk there they have a an ID</font>

92
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,760
attached to them if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,380
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> item it gets discarded if</font>

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:25,849
otherwise it's red and acted on it's not

95
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">fast typically a network within the car</font>

96
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,520
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about things like</font>

97
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,730
electric windows headlight systems like

98
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,549
that running<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 125 kilobits second</font>

99
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,580
now 500 kilobits<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the engine where</font>

100
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,810
you need slight<font color="#CCCCCC"> for higher speeds</font>

101
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,130
slightly more bandwidth and also less

102
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:47,050
latency might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single bus might be</font>

103
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:50,210
multiple buses it's entirely possible

104
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,700
with some cars that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the</font>

105
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,159
speed value which is constantly put onto

106
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,860
the bus and read by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dashboard will</font>

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,620
be available across the whole car for

108
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,960
some reason where it split into multiple

109
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,630
buses what we found with some hacks is

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,120
that they have points where they're

111
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,690
bridged and we'll come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to that a</font>

112
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,510
bit later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it's unencrypted sone</font>

113
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,400
authenticated the standard was put

114
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,719
together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 80s this stuff was never</font>

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,770
even thought about and it relies on

116
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,260
physical security if you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

117
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,909
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car you can hope at something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

118
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,110
the network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start reading and</font>

119
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,570
writing to the bus the door locks a kind

120
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the only security that exists</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

121
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,599
nobody was<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever really supposed to tap</font>

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280
into it and if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a sense</font>

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,100
of just how interconnected cars are

124
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,380
here's a very generic diagram that shows

125
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,190
the sort of distributed system that

126
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,880
we're talking about imagine any single

127
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:58,900
component on a car probably has its own

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,400
control system anything that has logic

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,719
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've ever won the</font>

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">window up and you've stuck your hand in</font>

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,539
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it sensed it and drop down</font>

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,799
that's handled by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate system from</font>

133
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:12,050
the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that controls the door locks or</font>

134
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,160
the sunroof or the dashboard or the

135
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,290
gearbox all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

136
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,960
attention each one of these talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

137
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:23,420
each other and it's sometimes not quite

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,109
what you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> um ignore the check</font>

139
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:30,110
engine light this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my all</font>

140
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,390
focus that's not why I sold in over on

141
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side is the temperature</font>

142
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,130
gauge and you think okay well you know

143
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,200
what temperature gauge is it shows the

144
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,890
temperature of the engine except I

145
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,719
noticed it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever had two positions</font>

146
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:50,390
it was either a cold or is absolutely

147
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,180
upright and i thought either ford have

148
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,030
their calling very very accurate or

149
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not showing me the temperature</font>

150
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,820
and essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to was</font>

151
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,549
that that has three positions and based

152
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,940
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the temperature from the engine</font>

153
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,490
is read by the ECU is sent to the

154
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:16,040
dashboard controller it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> either be</font>

155
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,690
cold<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay within parameters or hot it</font>

156
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,630
will only have one or throws three

157
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:24,430
settings that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually more a fault</font>

158
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,430
indicator than it is a temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> gauge</font>

159
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,599
now when I say physical security it's

160
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,210
worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointing out that this is a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">network that runs a lot over a lot of</font>

175
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,460
weird sensation and here we've got the

176
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">boots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open as well well in this car the</font>

178
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,400

179
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get to the can Network and that's</font>

180
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,770
even without unlocking the doors or

181
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,770
setting the alarm off

182
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,590
because it's physically secured how do

183
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,299
you ensure that nothing's tampered with

184
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,218
nothing's authenticated nothing's

185
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:38,958
checking that it hasn't been tampered

186
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:41,149
with and think about when you leave a

187
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,549
car intended but you give the keys to

188
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:45,290
other people how many times does

189
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,359
somebody have full physical access to

190
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,089
your car maybe when you take it to the

191
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:58,370
garage maybe when you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

192
00:08:50,089 --> 00:09:00,620
cleaned maybe valet Parker it's fair to

193
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,550
say that sometimes hacking isn't the

194
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,550
biggest thing you have to worry about

195
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:11,270
love that scene and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really has</font>

196
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,800
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of an issue now largely</font>

197
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:18,290
thanks to a paper that's put out<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris valasek and Charlie Miller a well</font>

199
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,279
well worth going on to the ioactive blog

200
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,560
having a read of this because what they

201
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,260
did was that they took a couple of cars

202
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,099
one of which was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prius and they hooked</font>

203
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:33,800
into the cam Network when<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what can</font>

204
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:37,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do with it turns out you can do quite</font>

205
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot because they did gone inside the</font>

206
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,200
physical perimeter and there was nothing

207
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,399
stopping them reading and writing from

208
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:49,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> can Network making the speedo read</font>

209
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:52,130
199 miles an hour accidentally crashing

210
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,529
it into one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own garages for a</font>

211
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,320
reason I'll come back to you later but

212
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:58,430
it's well<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth looking at and the prius</font>

213
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,720
is also interesting is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

214
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">first cars that came along where it got</font>

215
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,360
things like auto park so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

216
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">driving along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the car would look for</font>

217
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,399
certain conditions so am I stationary am

218
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,640
I in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reverse am I going at less than</font>

219
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">five miles an hour what turns out if you</font>

220
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,800
flood the canvas you can override<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

221
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,540
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> checks and they have it try and</font>

222
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">parallel park while going forward at</font>

223
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,779
speed

224
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,810
now there's two ways you can patch into

225
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,180
the cam Network so first is something

226
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,310
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all the canvas</font>

227
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,380
actually is nothing more<font color="#CCCCCC"> complicated</font>

228
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,899
than the twisted pair so you can get

229
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,579
transducer click like that run it

230
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,190
through your opieop software you got

231
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,689
access you may have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in some</font>

232
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,500
places depending on if it is a

233
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,480
segregated bus otherwise a lot of people

234
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually can't connect to a canvas</font>

235
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,339
initially at least through this now some

236
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,939
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might recognize this view not</font>

237
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:04,220
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> by people so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

239
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,600
the onboard diagnostic port<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and it's</font>

240
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,120
the difficult second connector but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

241
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they did quite well with it and</font>

242
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,889
first put first proposed in early

243
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,579
insight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the late 80s it's now become</font>

244
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:22,430
a standard around the world a mandatory

245
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:25,399
standard around the world so it's

246
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,779
appearing on but frankly most cars that

247
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,240
people here will ever come into contact

248
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:31,339
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have one of these ports and</font>

249
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,720
there's certain things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

250
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:40,850
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it really really</font>

251
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,470
useful for people like us so for one it

252
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,639
has to be in a standard location it has

253
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,500
to be somewhere within reach to the

254
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,449
driver it's often down in the footwell

255
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,740
somewhere near the door it has to be

256
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:55,849
unencrypted it has to be a standard

257
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:59,360
connector and anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be able to</font>

258
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,769
connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you go well from</font>

259
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,470
security point of view why wouldn't you

260
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:08,839
lock it down the concern was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

261
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:13,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it proprietary if you make it lock</font>

262
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,810
down suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> only dealers can reset</font>

263
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:16,550
service indicators can read error

264
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,800
messages and the only way you can get

265
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,589
your car serviced is by going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a main</font>

266
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,199
dealer and the argument was<font color="#E5E5E5"> well if you</font>

267
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,730
can fix a car with spanners and with

268
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:28,939
screwdrivers surely you should be able

269
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:34,279
to do the same with electronics so

270
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:36,400
that's why this is open to anybody and

271
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">what makes it really fun as well is that</font>

272
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,199
is the same connector that a garage

273
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,660
might connect to read an error code that

274
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the factory used to set the cars up main</font>

275
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,270
dealer will connect you with her

276
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,390
changing a major component so this

277
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:53,530
actually has a lot of power and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

278
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,460
data going through it again we'll come

279
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,939
back to this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more detail later</font>

280
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,170
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm guaranteed some of you</font>

281
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">will now go back to your cars and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

282
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,620
start pulling off bits of trim trying to

283
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,760
find this connector it's there somewhere

284
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,110
it has to be so connected cars i'm not

285
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,670
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through through this</font>

286

fantastic job in previous talk one thing

288
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,780
sorry I to jump out because I've taken

this applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all cars we're in this</font>

293
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,870
commands can be sent to the car who can

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,660
send them where they come from all of

295
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:43,300
these sorts of questions you see some of

296
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,680

300
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,449
don't know why I keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting stuck on</font>

301
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so they've what they found was</font>

302
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,800
really interesting with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeep which</font>

303
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,420
was you've got the app the app talks the

304
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:06,490
manufacturer manufacturer<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

305
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:11,079
car<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's why what they found was</font>

306
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:13,720
that the car had a certain gsm provider

307
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:17,680
and it had an open port to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

308
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,140
and you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually scan an IP range</font>

309
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:25,689
and start finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> cars open to the</font>

310
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet not only that the canvas is</font>

311
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:31,960
basically open on these cars to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

312
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,699
internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controls about what</font>

313
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,770
could actually be run are set in the app

314
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,050
and they're controlled up in by the

315
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,900
manufacturer so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you get here</font>

316
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:44,079
the communication is trusted unless you

317
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,840
go straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now what's really</font>

318
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">worrying is that there's one function</font>

319
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,360
that all cars have the cars with abs

320
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,819
and that is a facility to bleed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

321
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,949
brakes now with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ABS what you need to do</font>

322
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,660
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a series</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of pumps</font>

323
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:00,998
then you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure there's lots</font>

324
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,670
and lots of space soon get all the all

325
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:05,709
the fluid through get all the air out

326
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,509
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing this because it's</font>

327
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,609
basically retracted all the brake system

328
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:12,189
if you press the pedal nothing happens

329
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:16,299
now this is fine when you're standing

330
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:18,309
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they found with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prius was</font>

331
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:21,549
that they could send that command to the

332
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">car while it was moving and this was why</font>

333
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:25,089
as they rolled slowly into one of their

334
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,920
garage they press the brake pedal

335
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing happened and they crashed into</font>

336
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">the shelves at the back this is in the</font>

337
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:32,429
paper by the way the photos brilliant

338
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:38,589
but it's legitimate so if you're

339
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:41,230
plugging directly into a car it kind of

340
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense that that's what a mechanic</font>

341
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,829
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do hip lick his service computer</font>

342
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,329
in put into a bleed mode while it's

343
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:50,679
stationary or up on a lift bleed it

344
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:52,779
reset you got to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this they found</font>

345
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">they could send that same message to the</font>

346
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:59,549
car while it was moving at speed

347
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:02,199
remotely so they're driving along and

348
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:04,420
you can find a car not know whose car it

349
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:08,079
is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start sending a</font>

350
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,868
message to the car that says by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

351
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,319
put it into a brake bleed mode press the

352
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:16,389
pedal nothing happens there was no check

353
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,949
there was no mitigation there was

354
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:21,069
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stopped that happening</font>

355
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:24,609
either within the car or within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

356
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:26,618
systems of the car but they somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

357
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:34,839
it so open that even diagnostic modes

358
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:36,910
were available remotely excuse me now

359
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there was a similar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attack that was</font>

360
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,360
publicized recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> partners</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">family could hack a mitsubishi outlander</font>

362
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:49,569
hybrid what makes this really

363
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,999
interesting not they could hack it not

364
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:53,949
that they found again the canvas was

365
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,959
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open and there was all sorts of</font>

366
00:16:53,949 --> 00:17:00,209
odd features that you could trigger

367
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,930
remotely but that it was using Wi-Fi

368
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:05,470
because what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

369
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,859
is you can only access the car while

370
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,179
you're within range and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

371
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:15,309
turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the Wi-Fi range wasn't very</font>

372
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:21,010
good anyway now why would mitsubishi do

373
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:22,300
this via Wi-Fi my guess turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

374
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:25,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">ring up mitsubishi press office they</font>

375
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,928
don't tell you my guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's quick</font>

376
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,000
it's cheap you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put all the</font>

377
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:32,860
back end in you don't need to put all

378
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,500
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSM connectivity into all the cars</font>

379
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just put a Wi-Fi module in you have</font>

380
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,870
your apt form and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad hoc network job</font>

381
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:45,240
done which leads us on to the first

382
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:52,479
persistent threat with connected cars

383
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:54,940
marketing I've got this great idea let's

384
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
have a connected car what's the quickest

385
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,420
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it to market</font>

386
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,200
well we can't afford all that let's just

387
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,510
perfectly on Wi-Fi it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

388
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,920
you must have friends who tell you I saw

389
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,960
this thing on Kickstarter it's like a

390
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,210
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> card and you clone all of your</font>

391
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,980
other credit cards onto this one thing

392
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,360
and then it uploads all those details to

393
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,270
the cloud and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> access your credit</font>

394
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,250
cards from anywhere and at some point

395
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,650
there's like a spidey sense when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

396
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:26,920
comes to security it's what I call the

397
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:32,860
raised eyebrow of security you kind of

398
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:35,830
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay carry on and I was reminded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

399
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:41,199
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um I already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started a</font>

400
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:44,379
pilot with DHL<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon and certain</font>

401
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,360
cars in Germany you could tell amazon

402
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,360
where your car was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be parked</font>

403
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,949
seriously this looks like this looks

404
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,290
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've locked up this is absolutely</font>

405
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,020
true tell them I your<font color="#CCCCCC"> car's part they</font>

406
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,629
will come unlock your boot with a secure

407
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:05,200
one time only option leave your parcels

408
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:10,210
in your boot and then go I don't know

409
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,210
about you my boots full of crap<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

410
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,940
don't want people going through

411
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,130
and also I can drop the seats in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my car</font>

412
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,470
sir what's the boots<font color="#E5E5E5"> open you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

413
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,210
get into the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the car which then</font>

414
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,210
gets us back to the can bus thing I

415
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,500
don't know if they're carried this on I

416
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,940
can't find any reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> this past about</font>

417
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:37,140
April so I'm hoping that somebody went

418
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:39,810
really I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of get the same thing with</font>

419
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,210
the apps as well so here we've got on

420
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:46,340
this end we've got ford escape app and

421
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:49,140
you'll notice unlock engine start Lock

422
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,730
quite common with connected cars except

423
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,720
this is connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

424
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:57,480
your car can be anywhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

425
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:01,710
why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start the engine when</font>

426
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,990
you're anywhere in the world and as my

429
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,260
substantially away from it and we could

430
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,250
only really come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with really really</font>

431
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:17,100
tenuous cases and the same BMW I app in

437
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,500
awkward but we can't redo any danger but

438
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,330
lock and unlock again we've got this

439
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,810
thing where you why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want it in</font>

440
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,510
a nap this one's interesting this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

441
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,510
Volvo's app so again we've got engine

442
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,520
start engine stopped what it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if</font>

443
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:49,560
you want the heater running you've got

444
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,970
to have the engine running<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay still</font>

445
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,540
not comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sitting outside my</font>

446
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:55,380
house we my car with the engine running

447
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,260
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually precedent for this</font>

448
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,060
actually by the way I've just remembered

449
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,129
the ford f-150 pickup truck in the

450
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,030
states they had a feature that would

451
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,280
allow you to leave the engine running

452
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,470
while you're outside the vehicle they

453
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,570
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of it few years ago</font>

454
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,250
those complaints that brought it back so

455
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,929
you're driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> through America it's</font>

456
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">freezing cold snow on the ground engines</font>

457
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,950
running cars nice and warm you want to

458
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,810
go into a shop get coffee whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

459
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,420
can get out the car lock the door and

460
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,879
set a four-digit combination code on the

461
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,500
door go in and get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff unset it</font>

462
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,190
again keys still in the ignition away

463
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,139
you go

464
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,340
I don't know why that hasn't taken off

465
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:33,269
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the world but there</font>

466
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,309
we go so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why why put the</font>

467
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">functionality in are you doing it</font>

468
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:40,649
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to fulfill a marketing</font>

469
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,929
requirement is there somebody going hey

470
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:47,008
wouldn't it be really cool if you could

471
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:49,669
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or is there actually use case or</font>

472
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:53,970
put another way it's like Goldblum's law

473
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:56,639
in a gold rims lon you were so

474
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,029
preoccupied with<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you could you</font>

475
00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:01,709
didn't stop to think if you should and

476
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,450
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with car</font>

477
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,090
manufacturers is that they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

478
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,649
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> great with electronics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I will</font>

479
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,949
carry out by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> by saying that Tesla</font>

480
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,908
actually do a lot of their own

481
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,080
electronics if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this time the</font>

482
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:14,970
teardown stuff people found this got

483
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,730
Tesla branded PCBs they make their own

484
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,690
motors they make their own batteries

485
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,429
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically technology company</font>

486
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,289
that makes cars traditional car

487
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:25,049
companies though they kind of struggle

488
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,669
with electronics they do things like

489
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they press metal they weld it</font>

490
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:32,070
together it's heavy industry stuff in

491
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,379
fact seabreeze parent companies fuji

492
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,860
heavy industries their design for sort

<font color="#E5E5E5">of handling lumps of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Steel some of them</font>

494
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,758
make engines but they don't cast<font color="#E5E5E5"> pistons</font>

495
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,590
they don't make all the bits that go

496
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,039
into the engine they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of screw them</font>

497
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,570
together and then on the production line

498
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">while they screw cars together and they</font>

499
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:54,269
paint them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they ship them out to</font>

500
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,979
customers but what they don't do is they

501
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,559
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the car</font>

502
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,629
they buy them in there's a whole raft of

503
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,769
manufacturers you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and you</font>

504
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:05,730
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a catalog and you can buy</font>

505
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything you need to make a car the</font>

506
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:12,600
problem is what happens when those parts

507
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:16,018
have a problem so on the Left we've got

508
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,029
a clutch pedal from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toyota Twitter you</font>

509
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,159
know clever car company they use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

510
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,289
every single model save money<font color="#CCCCCC"> by and</font>

511
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,360
bolt be cheap it's only a throttle pedal

512
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:29,519
and then it failed it started sticking

513
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,699
that calls 4.2 million cars to be

514
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:37,440
recalled<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fixed under warranty in the</font>

US Europe and China on the right

516
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:46,559
right on the right is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> air bag from a</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cheaper explosive and they found</font>

afraid you want to hear they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

525
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:06,629
time it absorbed moisture and it would

either not go off in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event of</font>

527
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:16,039
accident or it would go off randomly and

528
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:20,220
it killed some people this has caused

529
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:22,320
somewhere between 15 and 20 million cars

530
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,019
around the world to be recalled<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had this on my car as well some people</font>

532
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,519
actually say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's even a higher</font>

533
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,710
figure than that and recalls are only

534
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,730
ever led by safety it's the rule of

535
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:38,279
Fight Club you know if the cost of the

536
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:42,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">claims is less than the cost of recall</font>

537
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:46,500
then come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way around is anyway</font>

538
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:49,649
and don't and this isn't trivial thing

539
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,720
either in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> states the obligation to</font>

540
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:55,049
change out components<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are faulty</font>

541
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,210
for safety reasons is enormous to the

542
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:59,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">point that cars that people know are</font>

543
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,620
affected but<font color="#E5E5E5"> are aren't on a dealer</font>

544
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:04,080
database or anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

545
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,820
private investigators trying to track

546
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,199
down these cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who owns them so</font>

547
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,330
they can inform them that this needs to

548
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,610
be replaced you know it's costing the

549
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,580
company billions of dollars and it's

550
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:17,939
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the company at risk</font>

551
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:20,639
now there's actually a security problem

552
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,429
bit like this so there was a researcher

553
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:26,820
can you read that kind of so there's a

554
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:30,389
researcher who found a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in door</font>

555
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:34,139
lock modules so this was a product

556
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:36,570
called mega moss and it had<font color="#CCCCCC"> pti crypto</font>

557
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:40,979
between the key fob and the car and they

558
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:43,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">found a vulnerability in it VW took out</font>

559
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:46,889
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> injunction to stop the research being</font>

560
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:48,840
presented because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would affect all of</font>

561
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:50,199
their cars and potentially put their

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,030
customers at risk

563
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,130
it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the manufacturer of the part</font>

564
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,120
it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who buy those</font>

565
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,310
components and it would have affected

566
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,110
all of their cars that were currently on

567
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:04,780
sale VW fought this for two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

568
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,560
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now out in its public knowledge</font>

569
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,000
and they relented for some reason and

571
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,740
on there but hey it's a nice picture but

572
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,139
this was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about VW protecting their</font>

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,930
reputation through legal means not by

fixing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and it actually</font>

575
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,890
turned out once the papers were

576
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,419
published it actually had a list of all

577
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,070
of the cars and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the manufacturers</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the author had identified weren't</font>

580
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,879
necessarily an exhaustive<font color="#CCCCCC"> list but you</font>

581
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,520
can see you know you've got trucks

you've got Ferraris you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> VW's you</font>

583
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,830

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:45,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">board and all because a component that</font>

585
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:49,270
is brought in has a vulnerability that

586
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,159
well car manufacturers can't fix because

587
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,660
it's already<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the car if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

you can't have everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but each year</font>

601
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:36,730
it's gotten better and then on this side

602
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:38,800
there let's put every beat BMW 5 series

617
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,730
do we do and they sent out USB stick to

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a vector</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that anybody else</font>

won't ask why you're buying them again

over-the-air updates built into the cars

integrating it over about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten cars and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">even now when we're three years on from</font>

643
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,500
the announcement there's actually not

644
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,889
that many cars there's only now starting

645
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,600
to become cars become a stream of cars

646
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have this enabled because it just</font>

wasn't in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> term</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first manufacturers to enable it</font>

650
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,580
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole range was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ferrari</font>

651
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,020
that's might because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's premium might</font>

652
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,340
because its high-end or it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

653
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:54,889
because this man sits on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they said yeah we're not going to tell</font>

00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:05,990

659
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,639
and through a few conversations I came

660
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with this sort of timeline based on</font>

661
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,440
again by car so starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with a no</font>

662
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,970
way OEM so original equipment

663
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,120
manufacturer having an idea for a

664
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:20,030
product getting it signed off internally

665
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,639
getting the buyer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign it off getting</font>

666
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,350
it delivered for integration testing

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,750
compliance heat testing durability

668
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:32,120
testing and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into</font>

669
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:35,180
the car is somewhere around two years so

670
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:40,129
you say a cable when's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration</font>

671
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:45,320
can be locked<font color="#CCCCCC"> well kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of here my car</font>

672
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:50,030
is was made in 2003 so I've got

673
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:52,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">something in my car that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was there on</font>

674
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:55,160
the 2000 release which would have been

675
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">delivered BMW in 1999 so it's four years</font>

676
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,540
old i also have an analog TV tuner that

677
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:04,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">now has no signal it can pick up and a</font>

678
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:06,649
tape deck I can't complain<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much but</font>

679
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the problem because cars are so</font>

680
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,190
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> greater because they're tested</font>

681
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,800
because they need to be reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

682
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,559
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw in new tech and it's</font>

683
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,220
now so integrated that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

684
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:22,790
swap out the stereo like you used to can

685
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,290
on my car yes you can't start taking

686
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,460
units out because everything's coded to

687
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,350
everything else and you've got a feed

688
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,610
from the engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a feed from the tire</font>

689
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,139
pressure gauge that comes upon the

690
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:33,370
display<font color="#CCCCCC"> and comes upon the navigation</font>

691
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:37,370
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort stuff is so integrated</font>

692
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:39,590
so it's we've kind of painted ourselves

693
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,629
into a corner the great thing for us is

694
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something you can play with</font>

695
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,090
and if you've ever wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into</font>

696
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,190
control systems engineering and it

697
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,490
hacking well guess what you've probably

698
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a test lab sitting on your drive and</font>

699
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:57,380
you can interrogate can you can read

700
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,178
these messages without it interfering

701
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,929

<font color="#E5E5E5">know just see what it's doing so if you</font>

didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did this and the forms a</font>

710
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,440
full of karen is going hey did you know

711
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,670
if you flick the indicators store can do

712
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and you'll do that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's light</font>

713
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,110
will come on isn't that fantastic you

714
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,040
can also get an engineer menus

715
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,760
diagnostic menu

716
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,740
so again a series of button presses and

717
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,190
flicks and what have you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up</font>

718
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,800
extra information out the car all there

719
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,060
none of it's usually documented but it's

720
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,780
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> around on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forum so it's worth</font>

721
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:50,990
having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google second thing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can buy</font>

722
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:53,300
a little adapter that goes into the

723
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">onboard diagnostic port I've actually</font>

724
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:58,100
got one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these it's a go point a</font>

725
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth unit integrates with iOS</font>

726
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,600
integrates with android has its own nice

727
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,520
app and you can start reading data out

728
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> canvas so you can read the error</font>

729
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,450
codes you can reset service lights you

730
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,030
can even start seeing things like speed

731
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:13,610
and revs another data that might be

732
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,320
available it's also really good a little

733
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,790
way of building a data logger if you

734
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,129
fancy going on track<font color="#E5E5E5"> and download</font>

735
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,389
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> app white Harry's lap timer but</font>

736
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple you plug it in</font>

737
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,880
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it by a blue to open the app</font>

738
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,550
and the data is that it's easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

739
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,560
it's easy to easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read then you start</font>

740
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,300
getting a bit more serious so there's

741
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,530
things like a vacuum cable if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

742
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:38,960
a VW audi group car then plug it in you

743
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:43,310
can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the depths</font>

744
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,320
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> alucard how it's built econ cable</font>

745
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,980
again more generic version of the same

746
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,659
thing lastly<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get really really</font>

747
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,270
into it you can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get things like an</font>

748
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,010
arduino shields so you can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

749
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,500
system that integrates into the card

750
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually reads and can transmit actually</font>

751
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,870
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would advise</font>

752
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,120
actually again if you read the the

753
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,159
ioactive papers it goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

754
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,790
detail about what they use how they use

755
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,909
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's an XR what they found it's</font>

756
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:17,179
fantastically rich information now for

757
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:19,339
me one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I really like is</font>

758
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:22,520
getting something for nothing come on

759
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,470
who doesn't so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> my club was</font>

760
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,110
released BMW brought out this which is

761
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:29,270
the m3 CSL at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was about</font>

762
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:31,160
thirty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent more than my car costs</font>

763
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,949
it's now worth about ten times<font color="#E5E5E5"> what my</font>

764
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,330
car<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs and it's got some special body</font>

765
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,939
works on special wheels a carbon fiber

766
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,909
roof some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice little features</font>

767
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,440
but crucially it has a third setting on

768
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:44,120
the traction control somewhere between

769
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,480
on and off

770
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:51,409
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as restrictive but you've</font>

771
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,969
still got safety net<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I thought that</font>

772
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:54,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be really really cool on my car</font>

773
00:34:55,150 --> 00:35:00,440
turns out what BMW did when they mainly

774
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,670
made this was they got the bespoke bit

775
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,670
so they got the bits that only ever

776
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,200
appeared on this car the electronics

777
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,150
they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> then put on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to every</font>

778
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,750
single production car and just turned

779
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,760
off the nice new things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you</font>

780
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,080
but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable things like that</font>

781
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,290
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like a dash option</font>

782
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,950
it's not there in the in the navigation

783
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:23,240
what you really need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like say</font>

784
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,980
for example if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the software</font>

785
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the factory used to set cars up</font>

786
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,120
when they rolled off the production line

787
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,620
I'll be honest you have to use a fair

788
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,879
bit of google translate but you'll owe

789
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,620
this onto a laptop you connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

790
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,360
car you connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the module</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you pull</font>

791
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,930
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> a config file which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple</font>

792
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,300
text<font color="#E5E5E5"> file and you start getting settings</font>

793
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,299
like this the google translate's our

794
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,310
mine I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know what the under</font>

795
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,760
control threshold is why quite like it

796
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:59,390
the override something I google couldn't

797
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,360
actually deal with but this is

798
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:04,430
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what BMW do is they put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

799
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,440
nice part in and they turn off a load of

800
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,720
functions thinking that you can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

801
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,660
it but guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gone to the forums</font>

802
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,069
lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> and lots of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone</font>

803
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,960
through this process software's out

804
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:19,550
there and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go further</font>

805
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,770
than this if you want that's aftermarket

806
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see you all it does is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

807
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,220
control how much fuel and air and spark

808
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,109
goes into the engine and make the car

809
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,689
move take yours out put that in

810
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:31,910
configure it however you want or if

811
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a bit more of a hobbyist so thing</font>

812
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,830
called a megasquirt that comes as a kit

813
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:41,529
now you might ask who is a slot person

814
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,090
who'd use this well some people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

815
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:47,260
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a bench and they connect to it</font>

816
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:49,930
and they test it other people say if

817
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,640
they had a goal from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 80s that built</font>

818
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:55,149
their own aerodynamic kit<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

819
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,190
fiberglass in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their in their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> garage they</font>

820
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:01,720
bought turbo parts off ebay and they

821
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:04,210
built their own ECU I love this car guy

822
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,160
who owns it just he has no sense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

823
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,920
can't do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> he just build it in</font>

824
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,649
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fantastic okay so you've had</font>

825
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:15,340
some fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> with your car tell let's do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

826
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">for profit so what could you do bug</font>

827
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:20,680
bounties believe it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fiat-chrysler</font>

828
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,520
actually announced this week that

829
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,220
they're doing one with bugcrowd<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">motors do one with hacker one Tesla do</font>

831
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,129
do one with blood crowd as well an Elon

832
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,600
Musk has even tweeted about people that

833
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">have found stuff in the firmware of</font>

834
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,700
their car so he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite on</font>

835
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,450
board with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> General Motors not so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

836
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,040
if you read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Conditions</font>

837
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:47,200
it's basically about a dozen ways they

can sue you<font color="#E5E5E5"> um automotive security</font>

839

testing a couple of companies are

840
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,600
starting to do this pen test partners

841
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:55,780
ioactive starting to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> security testing</font>

844
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:04,779
car security testing probably should be

at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point defensive security</font>

846
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,250
products saw one at announced this week

847
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:11,470
basically fingerprints the clocks on

848
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,780
each control module and can detect if a

849
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:16,089
message is either legitimate or its

851
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:21,490
interfering with us with the system this

852
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the first product I've seen which</font>

853

actually is trying to stop this stuff

854
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:28,899
being locked about with and again huge

855
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,000
growth area because cars are only going

856
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,230
to become more complicated and we're

857
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,460
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to a point fairly soon</font>

858
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:40,050
where your install the antivirus and

859
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:43,480
firewalls and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto your car and</font>

860
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:46,500
enabling remaps so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

862
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,350
some car car<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies now more and more</font>

00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:55,550
they want to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fiddling with the</font>

864
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:56,750
bits the computers on on the car because

865
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:00,410
they can make it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliable they can</font>

866
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:03,380
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems about well if there's an</font>

867
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,490
insurance claim or if they frankly if

868
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,170
you get more performance that you don't

869
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:13,060
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so when this car came along and</font>

870
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:17,600
the GTR when it first was launched the

871
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:21,320
just out the corner of my eye the the

872
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,330
ECU was actually kind of uncrackable and

873
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,790
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good few months until</font>

874
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:29,560
somebody found a way to put a new engine

875
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:34,640
map into it and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

876
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:37,820
monetary and reason to be the first to

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,859
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some others um some can be</font>

878
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,210
flashed like this so they can be you can

879
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">have new software uploaded to them</font>

880
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,080
others they have physical controls so

881
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,810
you've got actually crack the ECU open

882
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,690
and solder in a jump lead or take a link

883
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:53,420
out or something to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into a into a</font>

884
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,770
writable mode but somebody's got to find

885
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff out before it can then be</font>

886
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,340
production eyes and sold by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way if</font>

887
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lens your map actually</font>

888
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:05,620
is so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a representation of how</font>

889
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,180
much fuel and air goes into a car under

890
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,680
different circumstances so man to

891
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,029
throttle massive load the car's owner

892
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,970
and so on except it's not this simple

893
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:20,180
cars have multiple engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> maps depending</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on if the engines cold engines hot if</font>

00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,940
the fuel grade is low if the feels very

00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:27,230
a very premium fuel if the cars fight

897
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,880
the car develops a fault some of you

898
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,040
might have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> or even experienced a</font>

899
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,170
limp home mode where it puts into a very

900
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:38,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">very safe and your map now this is</font>

901
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally developed on a rolling road</font>

902
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,810
like this and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice this is</font>

903
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">rear-wheel drive so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rear</font>

904
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:47,600
wheels spinning on roller front<font color="#E5E5E5"> wheels a</font>

905
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,980
stationary now if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it with</font>

906
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,120
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> front-wheel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drive car after you have</font>

907
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,740
it the other way around so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front</font>

908
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,500
wheels will be moving the back wheels

909
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,089
would be stationary the other thing that

910
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would get on a rolling road with</font>

911
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,270
front-wheel drive car is the the

912
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,100
steering wheel would always be facing

913
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,160
forward

914
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,950
so if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that front wheels moving</font>

915
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,480
the rear was a stationary<font color="#CCCCCC"> steering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

916
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,120
pointing forward it must be on a rolling

917
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:17,930
road therefore it might be having an

918
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:19,310
emissions test and if theoretically you

919
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,740
were to have the car drop into a

920
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,690
particularly lean engine map you would

921
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,759
get great fuel economy figures in a test

922
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,900
lab and you'd get very low emissions now

923
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:35,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody has done</font>

924
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">this theoretically and then once you</font>

925
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,680
develop new maps so with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GTR now you</font>

926
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,680
can actually buy a device like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah</font>

927
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:50,540
oh come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so you can you can buy a</font>

928
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,940
device that will plug into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> onboard</font>

929
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,830
diagnostic port and you can then upload

930
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,200
new maps to it that functionality has

931
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,700
now been enabled and you can now change

932
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,980
maps on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly to either have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it very</font>

933
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:07,069
economical very very performance driven

934
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:13,100
and or anywhere in between now my I've

935
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:16,310
lost my remaining slides so the future

936
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:19,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of connected cars so I've talked a lot</font>

937
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,860
about can can as a physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> medium is</font>

938
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,140
kind on its last legs it's been around

939
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">since the 80s what's replacing it is</font>

940
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:29,529
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet so guess what all</font>

941
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,330
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know about sorry</font>

942
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:34,250
right so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we know about</font>

943
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:36,680
Ethernet security now can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied to</font>

944
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,700
cars you can have segmented networks you

know fee<font color="#E5E5E5"> lands you can have</font>

946
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,319
authentication you can now be sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

947
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,550
what's talking to each other is actually

948
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,880
what's supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

949
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,250

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,220
make sure that things haven't been

953
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:59,299
altered the only way that you'll be able

<font color="#E5E5E5">to load a new and some new data or new</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">their CA and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

959
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,140
important is because somewhere down the

960
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,210
line we won't be driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> cars well</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a Tesla</font>

962
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:19,220
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be moving towards</font>

963
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:21,730
autonomous cars and the liability issues

964
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,700
around if an autonomous car gets hacked

965
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:27,680
or gets upgraded or gets tampered with

966
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:30,109
suddenly becomes very real and very big

967
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the manufacturers so they need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

968
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:34,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to prove if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cars been tampered</font>

969
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:38,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that they're not actually liable</font>

970
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,790
for those issues so suddenly instead of

971
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">having people like us tinkering in our</font>

973
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,430
lot of this stuff's lockdown until those

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,980
keys start escaping from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

975
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:50,930
manufacturers and then we'll be going

976
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:53,240
through a loop of cars being hacked

977
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,490
again and because cars are put in

978
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,169
production for five<font color="#E5E5E5"> or ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years we kind</font>

of won't be able to fix it if those keys

980
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:04,099
get out lastly the other thing that

981
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,170
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have its load of cars on</font>

982

the road where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security on them is</font>

983
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:12,080
essentially obsolete so think about all

984
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:14,598
the websites that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> shaaban stuff</font>

985
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:18,290
it's now char<font color="#CCCCCC"> two certificates think of</font>

986
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,970
all the phone upgrades that happen that

987
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:23,240
improve the security of those devices

988
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:26,868
over time a manufacturer is going to go

989
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:30,020
back and retrofit those improvements on

990
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:32,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">two older cars no once those cars become</font>

00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,790
vulnerable they will continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

992
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,859
