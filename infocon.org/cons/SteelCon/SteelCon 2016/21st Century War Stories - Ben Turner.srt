1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
so everyone thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cover to watch my</font>

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,899
talk on 21st century<font color="#CCCCCC"> war stories big</font>

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,670
thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> silicon to have me back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,379
second year<font color="#E5E5E5"> immune Dave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did talk</font>

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,179
on interactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell sessions we</font>

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,070
met support last year so it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,059
be back again I've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,460
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for everyone in this</font>

9
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,198
talk so it's not only focus at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SE</font>

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,930
enthusiast but also the professional red

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,609
team and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions take</font>

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,830
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all at the end so the talk is going</font>

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run a little bit like this recon is</font>

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,149
quite important in any penetration test

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,640
so i'll touch on that talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

16
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">their current tooling and commercially</font>

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,950
pay for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source talk about</font>

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,390
getting inside the environment

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,969
infiltrating tactics techniques and

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,969
procedures persistent so once we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

21
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,500
inside an environment how we can stay in

22
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,510
lateral movement and then acting on

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,280
objectives<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was going to talk about</font>

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,129
crush c2 which we did a workshop on

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,140
yesterday and hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a live demo</font>

26
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:03,300
openly a<font color="#E5E5E5"> demagogue do with us so Who am</font>

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,589
I so my name's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben turn over those of</font>

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,140
you who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm a penetration</font>

29
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,990
tester and red team in attitude this is

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,220
me before via drawing a beer and after a

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:16,169
beer I've been through the Christine

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,030
leader exams and do my fair amount of IT

33
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,439
health checks kind of think that makes

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,000
quite a good foundation for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> red team</font>

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,679
you because you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these sort of</font>

38
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,150
late most of my focus is on red teaming

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">se star and see best I've also got the</font>

41
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,590
about now<font color="#CCCCCC"> for almost two years also not</font>

45
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,610
for an attitude and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what handles</font>

46
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,240
that then be to know if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

47
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,530
follow me bit of a disclaimer the

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,490
redacted for client sensitivity at

client confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so what is</font>

52
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,119
21st century hacking so 21st century

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,760
best and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of the most cutting</font>

engineering infrastructure hacking and

63
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,190
everything that's kind of what I feel

64
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,799
like it is it's free from caveat at all

65
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,359
forms so you know there's no constraints

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,610
really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to so why should we</font>

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">have them constraints and in my opinion</font>

68
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,240
you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not waking up at 3am</font>

69
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,260
to see if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shell inside an</font>

70
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,230
organization you haven't really

71
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,760
experienced red teaming what I'd say not

72
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,350
to class reteaming as a sort of blowing

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,149
the doors off a building with c4 and

74
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,799
access the computer systems that's more

75
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:54,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a military term so this is kind of</font>

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,750
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Team Eunice so</font>

77
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically in a nutshell when people ask</font>

78
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,340
me you know why should we do red team in

79
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,480
I kind of focus on this one story so

80
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bank over in the Middle</font>

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,600
East and they've had lots of penetration

82
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,090
tests and they thought were fairly

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,910
secure and so that pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I speak</font>

84
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to themselves it's just a normal ATM in</font>

85
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,960
the back it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually been jammed</font>

86
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,670
open by someone else not me so I saw a

87
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,970
nice Cisco switch hanging out the back

88
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,010
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so this is there is a lot that was</font>

89
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,130
its you ripped off held on with wood

90
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,570
which is nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we did then was</font>

91
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,900
able to actually plug in the cisco

92
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,269
switch and and see the complete

93
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,130
basically over the 3g 4g network see all

94
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,690
the bank systems i was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rdp onto</font>

95
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,430
the main controller or they were the

96
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,560
hack all the systems literally from that

97
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,630
ATM machine so I kind of you know why

98
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,769
focus on all the internal inside of

99
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,840
threat when you can kind of focus on

100
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of why I feel</font>

101
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it is really and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,489
example of another<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATM just this is how</font>

103
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,110
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the old another Cisco switch 3g</font>

104
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,890
router so we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to plug in</font>

105
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">into access to the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they even</font>

106
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a nice IP address with their default</font>

107
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,850
gateway and everything for me so I

108
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,019
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to work hard to get</font>

109
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so everything we do we kind of map</font>

110
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,620
it back to a cyberattack chain and the

111
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,780
kill chain from<font color="#CCCCCC"> lockheed marketing so</font>

112
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,000
reconnaissance delivery exploitation

113
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,380
pivoting and data exfiltration so I kind

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,060
of focus this whole talk around them

115
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,858
five sort of fundamental key principles

116
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:24,350
I guess red teaming also fundamentally

117
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,240
it kind of providing risk to the

118
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,470
organization and everything we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,000
to deal with based on a threat

120
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,040
depends which type of threat to a trying

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,240
to mimic sometimes it can be sort of a

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,230
lone wolf or the script kitty and

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,740
sometimes we might be trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mimic</font>

124
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,320
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation-state so depending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

125
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,150
what type of organization type of type

126
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,320
of organization the targeting might you

127
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,609
know change the way you attack it these

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,190
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different through actors and their</font>

129
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,560
capability so arranged in like I said

130
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,240
from script kiddie or lone wolf with not

131
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,490
much capability sort of easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

132
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,690
fingerprint easy detect to sort of go

133
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,980
and right up to the end of the other end

134
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,810
of the scale which is nation state or

135
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,450
state-sponsored so which has got like

136
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,370
custom cryptography very very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> anti</font>

137
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,950
detection capabilities and zero days

138
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:12,260
things are app and it's a lot harder to

139
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:14,780
bring print and detect so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess recon</font>

140
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,090
is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important principle</font>

141
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,650
in every penetration test I kind of live

142
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,330
by the now to<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper planning prevents</font>

143
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,570
piss-poor performance and I really think

144
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,099
it does every pen test<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ogden if you do</font>

145
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,900
enough recon sometimes you don't even

146
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,430
need to actively target the organization

147
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,640
because you can just get in on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Recon</font>

148
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,990
data that you actually got most

149
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,340
importantly the more you can find out

150
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the environment the better you can</font>

151
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,580
attack it about you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk weaponize</font>

152
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,110
your payload your comms things that so

153
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,479
you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great way to go the</font>

154
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,990
tools are simply tender users multi go

155
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,419
dns reconnaissance who is records media

156
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,380
social networking github and i'll

157
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest so you can read it for yourself</font>

158
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:54,290
but certain even search engine just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,030
know normal search engine operates and

160
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,990
things like that previous breaches are

161
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,460
really good as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well because obviously</font>

162
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,080
they've got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information and</font>

163
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,289
often credentials might sleep still even

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,430
work and so Dean acids are really

165
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,590
interesting one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was targeting</font>

166
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,240
organization recently and I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

167
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,890
they were that savvy in terms of email

168
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,479
security but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> when doing some</font>

169
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,890
dns reverse lookup so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

170
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,690
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using mine cast so I was like</font>

171
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh bugger probably not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get in</font>

172
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,860
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just having that knowledge i was</font>

173
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,270
able to adapt my attack method to

174
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,710
actually because i know mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> class is</font>

175
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,450
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at blocking attachment so i</font>

176
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,680
right right this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

177
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,820
send a document<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send a</font>

178
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">link to a document because I know it</font>

179
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,969
won't probably pick that up so that you

180
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,010
know just having that insider

181
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,180
information that's freely available is

182
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:37,849
really good when you target an

183
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:39,830
organization so email tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> sore email</font>

184
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,000
recon and tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are you so am I</font>

185
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,440
going actually throat

186
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,170
tool called prowl which is pretty cool

187
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go away and use LinkedIn or</font>

188
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,110
grab all the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from LinkedIn</font>

189
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,630
and give you basically a great list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

190
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,950
email addresses also when picks up on

191
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,130
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've gone out in a</font>

192
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:57,320
minute simply email the harvester more

193
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,760
to go fucker and obviously previous

194
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,080
breaches like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dis mention so these are</font>

195
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,510
these are great ways to get information

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,010
when your target an organization you do

197
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,270
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know the format of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email so</font>

198
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,349
you can probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by doing some</font>

199
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,320
manual searching against the

200
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,730
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I guess pick wisely</font>

201
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,830
because then you know if you are

202
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">targeting annoying as I organization and</font>

203
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,359
you've got sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an end objective that</font>

204
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you want to get on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> banking</font>

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get on this server you</font>

206
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,580
know linkedin might tell you that that

207
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,990
guy actually runs that part of the

208
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,250
company so actually you know you don't

209
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do any lateral movement if you</font>

210
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,980
can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> down on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his machine so again it</font>

211
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,900
comes down to research and recon this is

212
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,290
prowl so one of the tools that you might

213
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,000
want to consider it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

214
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,010
cross-checks against have I been pwned

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,330
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will pull back all the information</font>

216
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,740
it will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if any of these email</font>

217
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,840
addresses have been in the hub of<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

218
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,860
phone database so i guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing your</font>

219
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,659
terminology when doing this type of

220
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,430
engagement as well so spam phishing and

221
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,080
spoofing that are sort of quite

222
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,780
significant differences spans of

223
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,150
unsolicited bulk email like a respective

224
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,549
of content fishing is like a type of

225
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,770
spam but it's normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended to get</font>

226
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitive information or like fake</font>

227
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,919
paypal invoices that sort of thing and

228
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">the spoofing is normally sort of when</font>

229
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,270
you spoof the<font color="#E5E5E5"> from address so when you</font>

230
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,530
try it you know impersonate someone else

231
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,479
also know the counter measures as well

232
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you can tell the client what they can</font>

233
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,590
do to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help me to get this stuff</font>

234
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,590
like sender ID SPF D command D mark

235
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,659
had quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> success recently</font>

236
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,640
actually from doing an engagement where

237
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,590
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was targeting them I did some</font>

238
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,600
recon on their email gateway system and

239
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I didn't use the very top mail gateway</font>

240
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,770
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the third one and</font>

241
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,390
actually spoof<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from address so but</font>

242
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,799
not not spoofing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address from any</font>

243
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,780
random email I was actually using the

244
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,760
company name<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sending emails from</font>

245
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,290
themselves so it was like it almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

246
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,819
an open mail relay but back into

247
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,829
themselves and so the great thing with

248
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,140
this is without look it's a trusted

249
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,580
domain so if you like UNC path<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw</font>

250
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">images they'll automatically download</font>

251
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's a trusted domain so that's</font>

252
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,530
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great way to to get inside an</font>

253
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,910
organization you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font>

254
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,620
domains to hack them you can basically

255
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,060
just use their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mouse it so often</font>

256
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,860
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good idea to check that</font>

257
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,209
first so the current tool in any

258
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,620
industry at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so Matt's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

259
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,330
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best open-source penetration</font>

260
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,130
testing frameworks but I wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

261
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,180
it's great for red teaming it's quite

262
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,410
noisy and it's not but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very stealthy</font>

263
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,020
it's been signature by a lot of seeming

264
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,550
AV products as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reverse</font>

265
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTTPS comms are still pretty good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

266
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeouts and sleep now</font>

267
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,699
and but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still probably wouldn't use it</font>

268
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,880
as a red team you know venant so as a

269
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,590
red team<font color="#E5E5E5"> in two empires really good and</font>

270
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,570
but I've had some issues with proxying

271
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,300
and but it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool got some great</font>

272
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,550
modules and lateral movement and cobalt

273
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,780
strike it's not the cheapest but it is

274
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably you know one of the best tools</font>

275
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:52,910
out there for red teaming so getting in

276
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,490
so kind of have like a hundred percent

277
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,810
success rate so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I guess one of</font>

278
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the main reasons is sort of proxy where</font>

279
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">payloads and kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that</font>

280
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">all your emails or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your fishing or</font>

281
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,540
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty guess trustworthy</font>

282
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,250
and if you can mimic sort of like you

283
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,099
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nation-state listen to that then</font>

284
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,040
you put likely to get in some of the

285
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,410
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use or vba so macros</font>

286
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,730

hosting java files in in an applet<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

on websites and sending links to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

293
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">always sign that sort of thing because</font>

294
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,620
default settings on<font color="#E5E5E5"> java is high so how</font>

295
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,400
I means it won't accept anything that's

296
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,720
not signed so if

297
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,040
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of attacker would go</font>

298
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,250
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get yourself a code signing</font>

299
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">suit linked files as well quite a good</font>

300
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,460
one recently that's come out so you can

301
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,660
send a link file within an email when

302
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,390
they open the link file it's basically a

303
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,829
link to powershell it wins a bit code

304
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,090
click once done quite a bit click once

305
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,770
recently that's also good as well

306
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:58,520
especially when you target stuff like

307
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,780
Citrix slight cloning again that's a

308
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,220
really really good one you can just stop

309
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,839
sending email saying hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just upgraded</font>

they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using to fau</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get around that</font>

314
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,690
as well which i'll talk about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

315
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,220
but even sometimes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

316
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,480
you've even sent a short<font color="#CCCCCC"> efficient</font>

317
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,160
campaign you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try like</font>

318
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,940
a simple brute force against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems</font>

319
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,459
even if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> even say they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too FA so</font>

320
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,110
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually testing again the quite</font>

321
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,630
prestigious flying and they had a citrix

322
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,520
to a phase system on the internet which

323
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was quite interesting so because it</font>

324
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,210
said username password and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pasco doesn't</font>

325
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,680
ours is never going to work well<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I</font>

326
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,690
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try a single group</font>

327
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,630
thoughts anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the email</font>

328
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses that i got from from the</font>

329
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,380
linkedin breach basically I'd

330
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,760
photographer the organization sent a

331
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,650
shock none of the passwords now<font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font>

332
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,550
one across everyone and then it's

333
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:51,050
actually getting so not all accounts are

334
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,339
subjected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PHA you actually got to</font>

335
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,949
set that up so it's always always worth

336
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,240
trying that and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> egg access</font>

337
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,980
to literally a lot of banking

338
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,690
information and what was interesting i

339
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,210
was kind of hit jackpot really literally

340
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,100
the credit card data was stored on the

341
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,230
server external facing on the internet

342
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,190
and got access to coming behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> me now</font>

343
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">25,000 credit card details in the clear</font>

344
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,950
so and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

345
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to target the organization i just</font>

346
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,760
sent a quick brute force from the

347
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and got in so it you know it is</font>

348
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:24,350
amazing how simple it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

349
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:27,290
they got through a fey and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess</font>

350
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,910
the way to increase you know the success

351
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,069
rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> is increasing the trustworthiness</font>

352
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,660
of all your attachments or your emails

353
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,690
or your links everything like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

354
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">so what ways you can do that is</font>

355
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,770
legitimizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code signing suits</font>

356
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,300
purchasing burner phones so you

357
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,069
basically to get a coat on<font color="#CCCCCC"> insert you</font>

358
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,930
have a company so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> readied a company</font>

359
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,280
with a p.o box and then you can

360
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,140
basically go ahead and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> coats on him</font>

361
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,400
so it's quite a lengthy process<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

362
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,030
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing the stuff</font>

363
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,890
engagement

364
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">toronto sort of mimic a threat for this</font>

365
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,370
sort of nation state or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at or</font>

366
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,970
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> activists I hacktivists you get a 1</font>

367
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,290
probably a code signing suit also using

368
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,090
things like let's encrypt it's like a

369
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,050
free ssl certificate so when they see

370
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,000
the padlock in the back right corner

371
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:10,370
they feel nice warm and fuzzy so they'll

372
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,560
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> click your link yeah so as I</font>

373
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,510
said before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java default is high so it</font>

374
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,550
won't run if it's an unsigned applet so

375
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,770
that's me just an example of an applet

376
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've used and basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yets or sign so</font>

377
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,300
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't want any nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read errors</font>

378
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,380
another interesting ones while a slight

379
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,030
email reputation so a lot of the guests

380
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,090
more prestigious clients of ours use

381
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite good websites filters so they're</font>

382
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:37,010
blocking things like unknown or recently

383
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,800
created IP addresses or just direct IP

384
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,360
addresses so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to really go</font>

385
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,219
ahead and now create websites on the

386
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,270
internet and leave them running for sort

387
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of six months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to get some</font>

388
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,870
reputation just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as light and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brochu</font>

389
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">air or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something so if you're doing this</font>

390
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,540
type of thing against you know quite

391
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,670
quite a big client or something that's

392
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">got got a bit of security savviness and</font>

393
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,760
then you might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing this</font>

394
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,439
because as you can see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font>

395
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">there this is like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area this is</font>

396
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,350
there they would get if you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

397
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:07,280
campaigning so you know your stuff is

398
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:08,540
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back out a good way doing</font>

399
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,120
it is some submitting your site to

400
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google and there's a website's URL page</font>

401
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,960
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually submit to as well and</font>

402
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,400
so they get reputation then and then you

403
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,990
won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any issues also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use</font>

404
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,150
dynamic dns we've seen that blocked a

405
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,100
lot as well and so on it some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

406
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:26,480
early days we started to use that again

407
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">I try to not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use that fancy so another</font>

408
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,560
way we often get in is targeting so a

409
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,950
slight cloning or credential harvesting

410
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,680
so an interesting one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> citrix again so</font>

411
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,380
when you think it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FA if you</font>

412
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,479
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in basically saying yet we're</font>

413
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,390
just really citrix lalala and you clone

414
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,040
their page<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

415
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">some nice cool JavaScript embedded in</font>

416
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,550
the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that actually offloads</font>

417
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,470
the credentials to a third party site so

418
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,969
literally in real time I was getting

419
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,780
each potential doubt and was able to

420
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually log into the site real real</font>

421
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,470
properly and if you redirect if you do

422
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,359
it right and you redirect the actual

423
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,130
clone site back to the original site and

424
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,080
just like get it with a sort of failed

425
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,640
login page or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> they log in a</font>

426
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,870
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in getting and at that time</font>

427
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,160
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anything of it I think</font>

428
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll great my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credentials still work</font>

429
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,910
actually you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> foothold inside the</font>

430
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,949
organization now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a foothold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

431
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,390
citrix is kind of the best one because

432
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,740
you can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> break out a citrix to</font>

433
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,030
powershell that you're learning

434
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">irrelevant on a test where you can't</font>

435
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:26,939
break out citrix to a command prompt so

436
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,400
when i'm sending in some sort of fishing

437
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,550
campaigns clients really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like analytical</font>

438
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,160
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love graphs so the way I kind of</font>

439
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,740
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is have a three-stage approach</font>

440
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,930
so inside the email that was send up a

441
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,880
web book basically with it which<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

442
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,380
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> random integer so I can target</font>

443
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,480
and say how many unique random images

444
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,310
ever got back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm</font>

445
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,930
sending in a payload I can put in a

446
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,130
weblog inside the payload and then if

447
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,229
I've got obviously a document with a

448
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,880
macro or an hourly object if that gets

449
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">executed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know if I've compromised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

450
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,180
machine so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have a nice graph at</font>

451
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end which basically says what here's</font>

452
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,449
all the emails sent here's how many

453
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,099
people open the emails here's how many

454
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,660
documents opened and there's a many

455
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,650
hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> would compromise just got a nice</font>

456
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,449
graph when you're doing this type of

457
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,680
engagement so they you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font>

458
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,540
this and then go right we need to now

459
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,160
perform security work and skip your

460
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,980
awareness training off the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

461
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,959
engagement as you can see there in my

462
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,700
log is obviously like 1k<font color="#E5E5E5"> ng and then the</font>

463
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,160
ID but also it's good as well because

464
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,810
you know who's open your email and so

465
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,760
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say specifically that user not</font>

466
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we you know condone source telling</font>

467
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,720
people who who the unlucky people are

468
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,620
they clicked<font color="#E5E5E5"> our links but it's good to</font>

469
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that there anyway so UNC path</font>

470
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,040
hopefully you went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Niels talk but</font>

471
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,750
he'd talk more on this and basically

472
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,430
it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good way getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside an</font>

473
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,650
organization again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the clients</font>

474
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are I guess more developed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

475
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">got sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of good files and things</font>

476
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,470
probably won't allow this but if you

477
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,000
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNC path inside of an email you</font>

478
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually capture the hash the ntlm</font>

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,870
hash providing the allow port 445 out

480
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,160
band so we've done this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on loading</font>

481
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,200
engagements and you can just pay to get

482
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,120
hash so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the SMB ntlm</font>

483
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,140
challenge hash so again you can crack

484
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,730
that and use that on single practice

485
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,170
systems on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so it's a really</font>

486
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">good way of sending it you know sending</font>

487
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,769
in

488
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:07,100
with a malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> to of attachment or</font>

489
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:08,839
something the interesting one melissa is

490
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:10,099
like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're targeting like maybe</font>

491
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,958
a bank or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something which you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font>

492
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,579
isn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be allowed if people are</font>

493
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,650
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> from home basically and they</font>

494
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't always have a no split VPN then</font>

495
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,329
basically they'll be using BT Home Hub

496
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,039
scrappy firewalls and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an app for</font>

497
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,899
provide straight out man so you know

498
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,119
it's were thinking even it against the

499
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,610
more sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security aware clients to</font>

500
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:33,229
put this type of attacking so you can

501
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,760
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> as and that's what module do i</font>

502
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,440
do it or do it manually but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

503
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,309
module provide it a document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

504
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,840
basically recognize it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UNC path</font>

505
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:44,090
once you've crashed it quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hashes</font>

506
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,408
you can log into owa literally the

507
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,270
amount of times I've typed password in

508
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">owa and you get like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of information</font>

509
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:53,059
back or Wi-Fi people often send the

510
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:54,379
Wi-Fi code out over<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outlet and so</font>

511
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:55,970
you can use basic go outside the

512
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,620
organization hook up to the wife<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a</font>

513
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,970
new access to the network so these are

514
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,889
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read team the</font>

515
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,909
organization again without even really

516
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:09,559
sending anything in again the one link

517
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:11,299
we often<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and log into also you can</font>

518
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you actually manage to get into</font>

519
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,260
outlook add some user you can kind of

520
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,668
reply to<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if they've got</font>

521
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,860
company-wide email address you reply to

522
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,840
all add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNC in there and you'll get</font>

523
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,178
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> well our big the company's you get</font>

524
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,370
a thousand thousand UNC path<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out</font>

525
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:29,600
at you with a thousand hashes so that's

526
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:32,209
another good way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it so often we</font>

527
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,740
send mappers in macros are usually by

528
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,539
default that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are disabled but they do</font>

529
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,159
have a notification so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

530
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,500
can put something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the document for</font>

531
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,380
example like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and say oh you know to</font>

532
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,520
to enable the content in this document

533
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,750
please click enable content and

534
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,610
obviously that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will enable your macro</font>

535
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,720
and give you a foothold but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

536
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,908
nothing's happened and then you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

537
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,460
image change or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that so</font>

538
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:54,409
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always do is CV so I've got</font>

539
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,110
a nice little CV here that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not me</font>

540
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:58,669
obviously but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks encrypted so I've</font>

541
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,639
put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little image at the top it say oh</font>

542
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:03,080
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fault faking coding please</font>

543
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,279
click enable content to show the image

544
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the image appears and they're</font>

545
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:11,570
like oh yeah one more fuzzy yeah it's

546
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,010
all works as i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> before click once is</font>

547
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,730
really good especially retarding

548
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:18,720
something like Citrix

549
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,460
I've talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot about 60 that and but</font>

550
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,440
when you basically first go to citrix

551
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,910
ask you to install something so that's

552
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,620
why I clip once rich really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well because</font>

553
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,090
as soon as you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto this page if you</font>

554
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,949
clone a website<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and send in</font>

555
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,080
an email it once they click click

556
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,179
install<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll actually poppity pop up</font>

557
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,320
the box and go host checker yeah oh I'll

558
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,610
run that because I need to do that

559
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,409
because it always does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anyway so</font>

560
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's you know just legitimizing your</font>

561
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:43,710
attacks to make them make them feel warm

562
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,179
and fuzzy always anonymize your traffic

563
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,790
so depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what for actor you</font>

564
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,990
trying to MIT in these engagements you

565
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,700
don't want them to like look<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibly</font>

test right we don't on that and so

569
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,870
always anonymize it so ways you do you

570
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,399
can do this is by VPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> Azure round the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and Russia and all places like that and</font>

573
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:04,679
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the simple iptables</font>

back to your server just completely

576
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,660
anonymize as the traffic or you can

577
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">create like some funky scripts which we</font>

got some Python scripts which basically

says if it's legitimate web traffic

616
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,810
shell is only the beginning sure it's

617
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,400
great to get lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of shells yet dick</font>

619
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">yards would but to be honest it's it's</font>

620
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,980
only the initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> fold inside the</font>

621
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,420
organization so it's the lateral

622
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,280
movement and access and the crown jewels

623
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,460
which is where the real sort of red team

624
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,430
comes in but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

625
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be aware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we are don't</font>

626
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,560
forget when you're doing this type of

627
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,910
engagement you're going in blind so you

628
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,899
don't know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization looks</font>

629
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,340
like you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the network</font>

630
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,690
layer is you don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you've</font>

631
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,790
actually compromised the right machine

632
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,380
you want be on Bob's home machine but

633
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,899
you know so you need to just ensure that

634
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,250
you know doing the right thing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

635
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,870
make sure your implants landed on the

636
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct system be aware your</font>

637
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,689
surroundings is it on a desktop isn't on

638
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,820
a VD is on a laptop is the system go

639
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,240
into the main what's the system uptime

640
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:28,520
what's the date what's the language even

641
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,400
so I was on a job once and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> landed on</font>

642
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,960
it and any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Algeria randomly and I was</font>

643
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to add my user to the local admin</font>

644
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,720
group and it was like now it's not

645
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,950
working not working I was pulling my

646
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,660
hair out about 30 minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

647
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,910
administered towards or something in

648
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,680
French so just knowing that little to a

649
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:46,880
difference makes it goes a long way

650
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:50,090
really so persistence ryan michael so

651
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,400
here's another little story so again we

652
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,439
applied for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a job at the top of the CB</font>

653
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,240
we had our burner phone number and a guy

654
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,680
came and named Michael cause the phone

655
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,300
to three of us in the room at the time

656
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,580
and we were all a bit nervous been all

657
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,080
the phone ringing not really sure what

658
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,340
was going on so he was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you</font>

659

660
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,470

661
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,520
hello we've got your CV and yeah yogurt

662
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,020
yes is there but this needs to be a

663
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,370
problem with it there's there's a

664
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture but it think it's like all</font>

encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> iyi oh sorry yeah it's a</font>

666
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with it is there an enabled</font>

667
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,370
neighbor content / yeah yeah click it I

668
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,689
got a shell saw pretty happy and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

669
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,919
like did the image shows that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

672
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,460
shell so the reason why I'm saying is

673
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,140
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an implant in the organization</font>

674
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,990
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing we did was try to</font>

675
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,030
install persistence so unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

676
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,960
us it failed so reinstalled it was on a

677
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,730
VDI and we get it in the registry

678
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,220
we put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bat file on the seat in the c</font>

679
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,610
drive so that when the guy then log back

680
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,559
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he got a random VDI so</font>

681
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,529
we thought okay maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try sending</font>

682
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,970
in the document again so we sent like

683
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:56,860
Michael the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CV and said oh you know I</font>

684
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,750
made a few updates would you mind just

685
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,270
opening it and PDF in it sending it back

686
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,309
we thought you might not any weight

687
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,559
shell comes back in yes got another foot

688
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:07,000
all inside the organization anyway

689
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,970
second time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought why you need to</font>

690
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,770
nail this time we need the persistence

691
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,179
so we like yet right we put it here put

692
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in the registry blah blah blah anyway</font>

693
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:18,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">for another reason it failed who thought</font>

694
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,919
no we can't send a 30 surely not but

695
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,989
yeah he clicked the email and we got in

696
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,190
assistance again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the</font>

697
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,510
important thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away is you know</font>

698
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,399
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always be looking and get</font>

699
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,080
a guy like Michael inside the

700
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,129
organization so just make sure when

701
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,899
you're running with assistance put it in

702
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,929
the right place and check if you want to

703
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:38,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">VDI or something like that so when doing</font>

704
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,850
this stuff engagement there's four ways

705
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,520
that I think you can reliably get

706
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,080
persistence so if you're in New Zealand

707
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,700
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the best way for me is</font>

708
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,320
registry wonky so whenever they log out

709
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,880
and log back in something whatever is in

710
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,529
that Reggie<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonky will run so if you</font>

711
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,909
point out to a bat file or even

712
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,890
PowerShell directly in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will run</font>

713
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,659
if you actually manage to escalate to

714
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,480
system you can do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing on the</font>

715
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:01,720
hklm which will basically once a machine

716
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,950
boots in children a scheduled task so

717
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,570
you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a schedule tasto in every</font>

718
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,279
24 hours or every 60 minutes or whatever

719
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,139
you want that's another really good way

720
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,669
doing it sometimes in environments that

721
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,440
is actually locked down she can't you

722
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:14,049
should your task but I find more times

723
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not you can do that approach and also</font>

724
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:18,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">when if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do our system on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a box you</font>

725
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,580
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> create service which is one</font>

726
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,539
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best and most effective methods</font>

727
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,879

728
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:26,289
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> WI events so that's also a really</font>

729
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,179
good and stealthy way to get inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

730
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:29,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> persistence especially if you you</font>

731
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:33,880
know tackling a quite a good blue team

732
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:36,130
that knows what they're doing also one

733
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,450
thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I go on about it</font>

734
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,240
quite a lot but it's making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure your</font>

735
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">payload approxi aware so if you've</font>

736
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,840
escalated to system system isn't going

737
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,460
to know what the proxy server<font color="#CCCCCC"> is inside</font>

738
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,750
the organization it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have</font>

739
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,130
credentials on the domain to even get

740
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,440
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you need to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

741
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,660
can

742
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,090
payloads that you can put in the proxy

743
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,680
so Matt's what it's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good one HTTPS</font>

744
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,540
proxy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it allowed you actually go</font>

745
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,490
right this is a proxy server this is the

746
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,980
port this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the username nas's this is</font>

747
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,540
the password so just to be aware of it

748
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,010
because again this is an issue when you

749
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,690
escalate the system people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I edges</font>

750
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,760
and silver systems in service and happy

751
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:13,130
days it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> visit</font>

752
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:15,379
an environment so other post

753
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,660
expectations techniques that I use quite

754
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,150
a lot is things like cred credit popper

755
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,220
and key logging so just popping up a

756
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,300
credential harvest credential box on the

757
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,860
screen saying outlook needs your

758
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,540
credentials a really effective way to

759
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,919
get the password if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't click it</font>

760
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:32,149
first time if you do it a hundred times

761
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,730
but they'll do it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the main</font>

762
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a red team engagement is to get</font>

763
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,900
the critical assets or the applications

764
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,700
and often this isn't always integrated

765
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,380
windows authentication so sometimes it

766
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,390
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle or Swift or any banking</font>

767
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,920
app that doesn't rely on ad so actually

768
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might need to get their credentials</font>

769
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,090
for that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i ND</font>

770
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,199
using key logging sometimes we didn't

771
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,360
kill the application that were running

772
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">so they all just real so then i can get</font>

773
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,479
captured their credentials so at least

774
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,980
an example of the bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> its we thought i</font>

775
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,390
was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack they see i had to</font>

776
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,860
wait until they logged in force the

777
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:05,510
application to close and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

778
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">access the banking application so bring</font>

779
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:10,460
it on to another little story so we

780
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:11,899
approached a guy called Andrew and who

781
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,050
may or may not have been a network

782
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,210
specialist in his current<font color="#E5E5E5"> role so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i may</font>

783
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,760
also slightly over sold him in uit role

784
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,920
in another organization i offered in

785
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,440
pretty stupid salaries working from home

786
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,400
all the time good pension private<font color="#CCCCCC"> health</font>

787
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">care I really did sell it to this guy</font>

788
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,330
what wasn't fair in hindsight and he did

789
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:40,100
send me some bad messages after but but

790
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:41,300
yeah we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back onto that yeah so</font>

791
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,070
lately on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone so I needed this</font>

792
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,290
guide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to basically click something and</font>

793
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,490
it was very very targeted because I

794
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,020
wanted this guy because he was a network

795
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,280
engineer I want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he</font>

796
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,960
acts because he had access to all the

797
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,100
crown jewels basically so I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

798
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,020
to actually move so I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

799
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,760
work on this guy so I called<font color="#CCCCCC"> him a few</font>

800
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,020
times and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clever said I know</font>

801
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,400
y'all go home and I'll do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

802
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,000
obviously didn't want to when I was

803
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,010
acting as a

804
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,010
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do any of work time now</font>

805
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've got an anonymized form that</font>

806
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,970
you can fill out basically it just

807
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,440
creates it creates an agreement between

808
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">me you and that means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like an act</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

809
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,100
your behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work with this</font>

810
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,120
organization so I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> job of payload</font>

811
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,560
basically embedded inside the

812
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,770
application and he look she had to go on

813
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and put yet legal full name e-mail I</font>

814
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,300
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this content shall be given</font>

815
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:25,520
by UK law click that box suja click that

816
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:29,810
box<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a shell basically so yeah he</font>

817
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,450
did that happily so what was really

818
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,580
interesting what I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> on his machine i</font>

819
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,470
started doing some key logging and

820
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,419
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've really sold this job to him</font>

821
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,250
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually going to kit out his</font>

822
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,450
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home so he's buying shares and</font>

823
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,070
printers and things like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

824
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,450
don't know he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only doing this because</font>

825
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've sold him a job at working from home</font>

826
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,199
but actually he did have the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

827
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,090
kingdom use on all the switches all the

828
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,400
firewalls all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rooters and after</font>

829
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,959
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some key logging</font>

830
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,160
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

831
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,580
all I need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't even need to</font>

832
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,860
laterally mean it could have been worse

833
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,220
though it could be my mate who targeted

834
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,149
people on LinkedIn with that picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

835
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably get a broker's marriage if so</font>

836
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:15,290
i'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't do that so a lateral</font>

837
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,180
movement it's a key point in the cyber

838
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,010
kill chain and it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a key</font>

839
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,390
point to act on your objectives because

840
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,780
usually they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite as easy as</font>

841
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one that showed you about there so</font>

842
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually the way I do it is I would</font>

843
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">employ a sort of matter at this point</font>

844
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,380
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a great Sox watching</font>

845
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,150
capability so you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use proxy</font>

846
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,710
change with the socks proxy and use any

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,750
tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> one your cali but counting machine</font>

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,980
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you use it's just a</font>

850
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,300
great way of beta target an organization

851
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,450
with what you would normally use as an

852
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,129
internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test cntl am also does the</font>

853
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,590
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you'd have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use ssh</font>

854
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:50,180
through the proxy server obviously you

855
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,520
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a normal thing with like sort of</font>

856
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,290
PowerShell when RN w mi that sort of

857
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,550
thing but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just get</font>

858
00:29:54,290 --> 00:30:01,520
in and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own tools i would just</font>

859
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:02,990
tend to use the socks proxy stuff so

860
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,129
that's the module if anyone didn't know

861
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,170
what it is but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sock server</font>

862
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,940
basically it creates if you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell</font>

863
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,929
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> matt's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coit and basically you can</font>

864
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,220
use this module and it will

865
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:13,950
open up report on your box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

866
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,330
then use proxy change through it and you

867
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,119
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use all your normal tools like</font>

868
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:21,029
me do sir rdp SMB mapping it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

869
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">app basically so you might be really</font>

870
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:26,720
lucky and you might have a guy who's got

871
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document opens all this passwords</font>

872
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:33,240
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually obviously are again</font>

873
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,909
coming back to citrix but i do love

874
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,529
citrix and what I often find with citrix

875
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:39,149
is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people use them all the time</font>

876
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:42,299
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really patch citric service</font>

877
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:47,008
so again once<font color="#E5E5E5"> your breakout go on to</font>

878
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:50,249
powershell yeah elevate she'll remember

879
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:51,840
16 32 and get system and do all your

880
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,460
normal stuff like mini cats drop the

881
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,230
domain admin credentials out so this is

882
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">again why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i love citrix you can always</font>

883
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,039
break out and do something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

884
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:03,529
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd Utley on the domain</font>

885
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,529
controller again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all from home</font>

886
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:10,110
and access all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications banking</font>

887
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:13,320
applications transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and money make</font>

888
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:17,939
payments again all from home access all

889
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:21,059
the legal documents again banking

890
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,529
applications SQL service the rescue also

891
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,809
has quite an interesting one if they use

892
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:27,119
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Imperva Imperva will log</font>

893
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:28,918
access to databases basically on a

894
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,259
network level what's interested if you

895
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,970
are deeply actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the SQL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

896
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,610
and go through the manager here none of

897
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's logged that's a good way getting</font>

898
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:41,340
around when you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a red team</font>

899
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,499
vs blue team type thing so yeah I guess

900
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,959
that's kind of my social engineering and

901
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:47,340
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reading in background so me and</font>

902
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,019
Dave hardly over there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I created a tool</font>

903
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,779
called posh c2 to help alleviate all

904
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:53,820
this or all this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to</font>

905
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:56,100
try and do a live demo I'll do a quick

906
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,168
introduction first so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

907
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,850
maintained free and open source it was

908
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:02,909
inspired by some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff we did in</font>

909
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,350
Matt's point last year and it kind of

910
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:06,090
allows you to learn powershell and a

911
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,320
phased approach so most people get

912
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,119
scared when they open power charlotte

913
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,529
pros read errors so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a good</font>

914
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,158
way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting you to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powershell</font>

915
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:16,529
it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> is encrypted with 128-bit key</font>

916
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,059
it's got an auto kill switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

917
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:19,379
you know got a really risky customer

918
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,428
doesn't like to just stop engagement

919
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:22,709
because they will you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

920
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:24,330
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do land we you know some reason</font>

921
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't manage to get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shelves gone in</font>

922
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,178
two weeks it will you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it hits</font>

923
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:28,740
that to reap mark it will just

924
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,309
automatically kill the shells so it's

925
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,570
kinda just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a risk mitigation thing</font>

926
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:36,299
so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a red teaming tool it's</font>

927
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,789
also basically a penetration testing

928
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,408
tool kit simple and really easy to

929
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:42,119
install basically we've written a little

930
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,799
installer one line it will do everything

931
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you anything it doesn't do is</font>

932
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,230
install jdk which you need to create the

933
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,490
Java payloads if you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

934
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,830
works on powershell version 2 and above

935
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:55,860
so in the seven eight ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. anything</font>

936
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:58,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">on tap it's based on customizable HTTP</font>

937
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,789
beacons so you can set them to have a

938
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:00,990
long you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> five seconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds</font>

939
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">two minutes three minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all things</font>

940
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's also got a ten percent jitter</font>

941
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,090
so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a sort of a blue team</font>

942
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:08,429
its monitoring traffic like maybe every

943
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:10,830
60 seconds it's a bit a jitter so it

944
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:13,980
sort of transfers it from like 55 to 65

945
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,749
etc it's maintainable and modular once

946
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,399
again one of the big things so we're not

947
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,509
saying we're good as in<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell but</font>

948
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,908
basically we're just giving you the

949
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:22,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity to use PowerShell modules in</font>

950
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:24,269
in aretta me engagement so all the

951
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,220
modules with carbon Jory things that is

952
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:27,929
written some great modules you can put

953
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,399
these in them in the modules folder and

954
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:31,230
load them on them you know load load on

955
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:33,239
client again I'll show you this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

956
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute it's been tested again sort of</font>

957
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,139
fire I Palo Alto we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some quite</font>

958
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:38,460
clever stuff with image heuristics so if

959
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:39,928
they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put all the traffic back</font>

960
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,490
together as all you would see is a

961
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:43,139
little image of like Facebook or Twitter

962
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,929
or LinkedIn so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really</font>

963
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:47,969
quite cool and again one of the main

964
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,649
things about doing this type of type of

965
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,419
job is that you need to give the blue

966
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:52,860
team is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to work on obviously</font>

967
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,480
it's great to say I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> in but you need</font>

968
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,590
to say well I access this I did this and

969
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,450
I did this and I compromised these

970
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,158
machines so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most important</font>

971
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,409
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us is this output to HTML</font>

972
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,149
function so it basically tells you every

973
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:05,279
implant that you've got on on the work

974
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:07,739
on on the implant like every implant

975
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,869
you've got on each called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a workstation</font>

976
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,869
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also tells you every command</font>

977
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:14,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every output so if you could</font>

978
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:19,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to get a screen shot off some it's</font>

979
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:19,399
always in there let's give this a go

980
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:47,170
so basically when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it up it will</font>

981
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:50,759
say I haven't got my peak so I held on

982
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,760
to need a demo gods were with me

983
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,230
service

984
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,439
okay well

985
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:05,259
yeah no it's not that now come on I'm

986
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:09,669
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to reboot this machine is</font>

987
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:10,809
very few seconds sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's windows it</font>

988
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:19,119
all work once you switch it off and on

989
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:24,190
again demo<font color="#CCCCCC"> God's should have videoed it</font>

990
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,459
knew it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know there's a ballsy move and</font>

991
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,459
it failed

992
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:35,560
now so I'm ants just me PG

993
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:31,520
alright we're back so over that so this

994
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it should look like when you get</font>

995
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,180
an IP so<font color="#CCCCCC"> lady I'll get the IP from the</font>

996
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,350
network adapter which at the moment is

997
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,819
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> one 1761 8128 and so the first</font>

998
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,500
thing you'll ask you is what IP do you

999
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,420
want to use or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> seek what's the sea</font>

1000
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,010
to sort of server in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back end so</font>

1001
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,170
usually this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be like the URL that</font>

1002
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,510
you using and in the engagement so it

1003
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,460
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain default orbit just</font>

1004
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:55,400
the external facing IP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually it's</font>

1005
00:38:52,460 --> 00:39:00,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">not an internal IP so once you've done</font>

1006
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,490
that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> lasts you'd basically basically</font>

1007
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,970
what folder you want to put it any I'll

1008
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:06,709
just give you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> temporary name default</font>

1009
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,060
beacon time so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set that</font>

1010
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,790
to anything less or more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

1011
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,350
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it got the auto kill switch</font>

1012
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,230
date so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually extend that</font>

1013
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,430
will make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> less if you wanting and</font>

1014
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,530
then the default port again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd always</font>

1015
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,850
recommend 80 or 443 just because when

1016
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,830
you're in then proxy where environments

1017
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:24,980
18<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you generally what is only</font>

1018
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,810
allowed out and then what it will do is

1019
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,940
it will create<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for the red team in</font>

1020
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,440
that section<font color="#E5E5E5"> three red with black so</font>

1021
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your java payload again it's</font>

1022
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,430
unsigned so if you get coat on and suit

1023
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,900
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually then basically sign</font>

1024
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,669
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hosted some on the</font>

1025
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,200
internet it will create<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a batch file</font>

1026
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,480
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just more used for</font>

1027
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,160
internals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll create your macro</font>

1028
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,330
payload that again you can just put

1029
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,770
straight into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Word document to</font>

1030
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,660
weaponize it and send into the client

1031
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they will also create your data link</font>

1032
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,490
a file again if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send that in</font>

1033
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,399
to the organization it's also another

1034
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,990
way you can run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on internal is</font>

1035
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,970
basically with like the top one there

1036
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,290
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell how can exact bypass</font>

1037
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,640
that one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just a quick way</font>

1038
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,440
doing it but it's not always proxy aware

1039
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,049
that way because it using the download

1040
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,610
cradle so I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> always use that only</font>

1041
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,630
on Eternals I would use the other ways

1042
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,790
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to read to you an</font>

1043
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,860
engagement also if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to try and</font>

1044
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,540
bypass app lock or a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 sub cheese</font>

1045
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,070
written some cool stuff about it on how

1046
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,009
to use install util so I've actually

1047
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:21,260
embedded that everyone so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will not</font>

1048
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">even use any execute walls on the disk</font>

1049
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,060
so if I got bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 it's not that and I'll</font>

1050
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">just work until I get for all so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

1051
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:31,279
another window will open which is the

1052
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">implant window so that's how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1053
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,150
actually give command so this server<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1054
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,720
the CTU server and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implant</font>

1055
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,040
handler so all

1056
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,839
so all the commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything will</font>

1057
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,279
actually output here all on the screen

1058
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what you use to basically</font>

1059
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,730
interact with the clients and in the

1060
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,740
foot holes once you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so I'll</font>

1061
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,780
just go ahead and run the payload on my

1062
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:53,879
machine just to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it looks</font>

1063
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:55,320
like run the bat file in there you go as

1064
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,550
you can see it gives you the encryption

1065
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,200
key that's using to encrypt all the

1066
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,510
traffic back and forth it tells you a

1067
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,580
bit about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client so what domain it's</font>

1068
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,830
on which is Windows 10 spoon what user

1069
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,390
what the architecture of the machine is

1070
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:09,330
and the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1071
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:12,359
injected into which is 4 6 8 a and the

1072
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:14,610
default sleep time then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

1073
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:20,130
and use the implant basically on this

1074
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:21,300
window so it's basically just command

1075
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,710
line that so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can run whatever you</font>

1076
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,210
want so rewritten some quite cool

1077
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,130
modules in it but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1078
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,690
like you want normal PowerShell commands

1079
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">so anything like Who am I everything</font>

1080
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">will work so when it first does it loads</font>

1081
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,260
the implant<font color="#CCCCCC"> core which has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a few</font>

1082
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:37,830
features and stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then again it</font>

1083
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,720
will run your command so some of the

1084
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,069
modules we've written and some of the

1085
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,330
modules we haven't but again that's the

1086
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,860
great thing about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools you can put</font>

1087
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,509
any module in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just load the</font>

1088
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,980
module by just doing load module blah

1089
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,470
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will just load module</font>

1090
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,590
inside inside the organization basically

1091
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,549
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client machine you compromise</font>

1092
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,470
there's got some a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1093
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,180
again I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for all the basically</font>

1094
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a demo just to</font>

1095
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,569
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it can do all the traffic</font>

1096
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,670
is obviously going over HTTP but it's

1097
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:04,740
all encrypted it's all looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like images</font>

1098
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,870
which there's also a temporary image so

1099
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,540
if you go inside the folder that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1100
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:11,279
create posh et voila bar w called temp

1101
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,740
heuristic image which will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1102
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,710
image<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets that gets sent back and</font>

1103
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth with the binary encrypted data</font>

1104
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that's all well see</font>

1105
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:28,340
some of the cool thing you can do with

1106
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:30,560
it well you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of the modules</font>

1107
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell but I guess</font>

1108
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,150
some of the great things is like get

1109
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:39,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">screenshot so again Abbot have a play</font>

1110
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,320
with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all on get up get up / an</font>

1111
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,330
attitude /<font color="#CCCCCC"> quashed e2 but it's really</font>

1112
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite cool and but yeah I wouldn't go</font>

1113
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,220
for it all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's basically</font>

1114
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,900
essentially what it does and how it

1115
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,790
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and loads of things like Craig</font>

1116
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:53,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">popular again that's quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool one she</font>

1117
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:54,500
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying before so evident i do want a</font>

1118
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,140
regimen gagement I kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of</font>

1119
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,850
put into this so we've kind of done all

1120
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,620
the hard work for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I've got a</font>

1121
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,180
wiki which I've got all my notes for so

1122
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,770
when running a red team I'd like maybe

1123
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,450
wanted to latch remove using wmi or

1124
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,980
something so instead of me<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a wiki</font>

1125
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,629
now they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pour it all out into</font>

1126
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,100
here so all the commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything</font>

1127
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,600
it's all there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1128
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,920
actually running so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing</font>

1129
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,630
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to hide anything and we</font>

1130
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,900
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to learn when you use this tool</font>

1131
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,220
so just for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the pop-up box</font>

1132
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,750
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what it's running on</font>

1133
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,879
the client so you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying</font>

1134
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:26,060
to hide anything you can see it you can

1135
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,690
win your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own PowerShell commands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

1136
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">cred proper here</font>

1137
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:41,460
root username and password<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a</font>

1138
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to get any passwords so</font>

1139
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,880
yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick demo</font>

1140
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,440
the output HTML quite cool as well but

1141
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,850
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling me about again I won't</font>

1142
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,260
have got anything here that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

1143
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:51,259
slides now I'll just pretending

1144
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,140
yeah a bit of a road map so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying</font>

1145
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to create more methods of the initial</font>

1146
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,230
payloads we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a click</font>

1147
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,250
once so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you open it it</font>

1148
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,470
automatically have a flick once

1149
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,840
application there when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I create a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTA</font>

1150
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,310
which is like a hypertext application

1151
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,390
HTML application again which you might

1152
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,759
want to use when you're sending into the

1153
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization what we also like to do is</font>

1154
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a daisy-chain method so once you</font>

1155
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,279
target one machine in the organization

1156
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,140
and you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to then laterally</font>

1157
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,270
move but instead of them all going out

1158
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,190
of the proxy maybe just use one host so

1159
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,080
that'd be quite a cool little feature

1160
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,850
also like to implement process migration

1161
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,310
so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always in them at the moment</font>

1162
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,540
in like a PowerShell process so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1163
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,430
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject into another</font>

1164
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,840
procession of the running process but

1165
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,190
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things at</font>

1166
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,230
the allows and things and gets quite

1167
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,930
complicated probably far beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine</font>

1168
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge also complete yeah that we</font>

1169
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,470
really quite cool and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

1170
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,900
to type things everything autocompletes

1171
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:56,609
but that's Dave's job but feel free to

1172
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,170
pull requests that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you access it</font>

1173
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,000
that's how you download<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're</font>

1174
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,670
actively doing things basically daily

1175
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,990
probably too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much to be honest but yeah</font>

1176
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,520
have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at downloaded it mess with</font>

1177
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,169
it it's all PowerShell it's basically to

1178
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,300
code two lines right to the lines of

1179
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,250
code that'll be nice at two scripts

1180
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,360
itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got the sea to serving</font>

1181
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,920
you got the implant handler so it's

1182
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,250
really easy to edit even you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1183
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,570
to know much<font color="#E5E5E5"> perishing so as I said the</font>

1184
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,680
logging is really an important part for

1185
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:24,870
us so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see here this like</font>

1186
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,399
basically shows you that's the command

1187
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,049
one that's the implant so you get to

1188
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,000
HTML files that want to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

1189
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,530
implants<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got when you first saw them</font>

1190
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,210
when you last saw them the IP address

1191
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that should be the external IP address</font>

1192
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,330
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internally that's the</font>

1193
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,590
internal IP address and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they use it and</font>

1194
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all the commands and everything</font>

1195
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,860
so if you forget to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1196
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,060
just take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a screenshot on that and it</font>

1197
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,230
tells you exactly what you've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1198
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,040
you can let you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you go this is</font>

1199
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,040
what we did inside the organization

1200
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:53,790
there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reference stuff that</font>

1201
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:55,599
you might want to use so anyway I

1202
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,339
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sponsored a bar</font>

1203
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,900
which is the most important thing I

1204
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:00,910
think we went through and finished by

1205
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,200
about half<font color="#E5E5E5"> one last year so if we can</font>

1206
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,999
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make it 12 this year that we did</font>

1207
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,319
and if you want to grab me for a beer

1208
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:10,709
after catch up anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool thanks any</font>

1209
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,710
questions

1210
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:35,630
any questions define everything yeah

1211
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks anymore cool all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right let's go</font>

1212
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,930
get beer
