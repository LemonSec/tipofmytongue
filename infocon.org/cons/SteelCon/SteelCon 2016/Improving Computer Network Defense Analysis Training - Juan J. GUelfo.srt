specialized in information security

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,510
services located in Norway just to tell

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,279
you a bit about my background I'm a

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,940
computer engineer I have a few

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,480
certifications and my work I do both

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,870
offense and defense so I do application

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,480
network security testing red teaming and

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,949
I also have some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for helping</font>

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,000
customers with network security

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,940
monitoring and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> training in my free</font>

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,760
time which I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have much I develop a</font>

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,309
few open source tools one of them is the

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,750
blue team training tool kit and

22
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:05,700
hopefully we will see a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it in there in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the demos so before</font>

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get started can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you show your hands</font>

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,229
those blue team ears<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay red teamers</font>

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:21,450
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone in the training industry</font>

27
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:24,090
college universities<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this talk</font>

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,970
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> focusing on defense but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to say</font>

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff that I'm going to</font>

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:34,110
show today could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned into a you</font>

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,210
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> red team asset so in this case add</font>

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,369
information and i will show you also a

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,919
few tips it could be useful for

34
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:46,560
resurrecting engagements as well so it's

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,530
old news that avian firewalls can be

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,659
bypassed by attackers and even though we

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,810
have had some improvements with the

38
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,689
next-generation firewalls next gen IV

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,869
and so on the truth is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

40
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,270
technology is not make things any better

41
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:05,070
so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a company's our</font>

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,030
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not possible to</font>

43
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,519
keep the attackers from coming in so

44
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,860
they little by little they are focusing

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,190
more on detection and incident response

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,860
and if you are in a blue team and if I

47
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,660
didn't see the incident that happens

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,310
sooner or later you will need computer

49
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:30,030
and write 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense analysis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just for</font>

50
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:33,750
short Sen VA at some point if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

51
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,580
the training landscape we could see that

52
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,980
in the information security industry

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,050
we're having a challenge and we have a

54
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,109
shortage of qualified<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec</font>

55
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,750
professionals so what we see at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

56
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,170
in Norway is that many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations that we work with they</font>

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,440
tend to well have a hard time when they

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,930
try to build a blue team from scratch or

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,840
if they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain hire new people</font>

61
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,670
find the right skills that they want so

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,610
instead of going through the painful

63
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,230
process of finding the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> employee</font>

64
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,970
and they tend to teach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> train</font>

65
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,470
existent employees with that knowledge

66
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:18,330
that skill set that they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing in</font>

67
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to that if we look at the</font>

68
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,030
offensive in infosec industry focusing

69
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,630
on other sorry replication simulation

services<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Team pen testing and so on</font>

71
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:33,870
we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that organizations here</font>

72
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,399
at the top of the pyramid are the ones

73
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,519
that usually get the most benefit from

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">them basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because they already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> medium sized businesses</font>

businesses and individuals who don't

<font color="#CCCCCC">computer nerd defense skills we're</font>

thinking about defense for me that I

tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep an offense perspective I</font>

have to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a red team with</font>

computer natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense analysis skills</font>

112
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,840

<font color="#CCCCCC">effective red team in other words the</font>

114
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,099
red team will understand how the blue

115
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,380
team operates and this will allow them

116
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,870
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient and at the same</font>

117
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:45,240
time and more effective when achieving

Red Team ER or maybe just a single

120
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,789
individual learning I have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

121
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,740
practice is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> required if you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on to the next level and the skills at</font>

least in the computer retro defense

125
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,120
analysis and you can get them from many

126
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,640
different ways one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most use is by</font>

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,670
learning and analyzing network traffic

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,820
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a key material that needs to</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated in an efficient way if you</font>

130
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:24,659
want to get relevant cases and then

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,270
analyze and learn so if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

132

start your<font color="#E5E5E5"> training sessions you will</font>

133
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:34,229
need some sort of environment where you

134
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">can run maybe a piece of malware monitor</font>

135
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:40,460
the network and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture the end the</font>

136
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,460
traffic which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening right there</font>

137
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,260
we argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are four major</font>

138
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,349
challenges that companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> facing</font>

when they are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Train</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Blue team</font>

140
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:57,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and the first one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

141
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,330
difficulty of implementation of an

142
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,040
attack scenario so the definition it

143
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,409
would be how difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

which is hosting attack scenarios how

146
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,719
you can set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up and especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,840
time is going to be required so when you

149
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">are planning and preparing a training</font>

150
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,000
session you will have to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time</font>

151
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:27,400
during the preparation typical tasks

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,250
here could be finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what sort of</font>

153
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,849
attack scenario you want to simulate for

154
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:37,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> training session and like I said if</font>

155
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,370
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of a fixed set</font>

156
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,090
up that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse over and over this</font>

157
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,860
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to require some maintenance</font>

158
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">hmmm think about for example if you if</font>

159
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,530
you have to give or configure a specific

160
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,929
patch level in yours in your environment

161
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:55,030
with it require work are we thinking

162
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual machines or physical</font>

163
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,419
environments so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all about the</font>

164
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,780
difficulty of implementation another

165
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:08,170
important component it's the monitoring

166
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,359
in other words how we can capture the

167
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,180
network traffic produced in during a

168
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,670
training session and at the same time I

169
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,790
have it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a format which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is compatible</font>

170
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:22,240
with tools so we can work further<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

171
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:26,500
them if we think about the ideal

172
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,880
training session I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

173
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:39,760
training session should have low

174
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:42,159
preparation requirements the next

175
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,350
is cost and this is the amount of

176
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,459
resources required for the correct

177
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:50,530
implementation of an attack scenario and

178
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,980
basically here we are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

179
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:57,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">budgets organizations IT departments run</font>

180
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,230
on budgets which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

181
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,810
to have a training<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment in place</font>

182
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:05,260
you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need extra hardware</font>

183
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,839
maybe software licenses if you hire an

184
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,100
external erecting this is going to

185
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,010
increase your costs so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had low</font>

186
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,900
training costs sessions this means that

187
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,290
we could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complete training</font>

188
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,420
programs for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same money or</font>

189
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,030
alternatively cover more additional IT

190
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,130
areas plus the training with the same

191
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:31,990
budget so this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge benefit</font>

192
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:34,570
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> four companies one of the major</font>

193
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:38,100
factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that could allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

194
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,570
improvement in in reducing costs is

195
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,200
reusing the product of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> training</font>

196
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:47,110
session typically network traffic and if

197
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,840
we can reuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and customize it to our</font>

198
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:53,170
needs this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> allow us to train</font>

199
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,740
without actually mounting a new attack

200
00:09:53,170 --> 00:10:00,490
scenario every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we want to to to</font>

201
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,400
prepare a training session so from the

202
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,740
idea of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> once again we</font>

203
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:12,189
think that training<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions should</font>

204
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:14,680
minimize costs whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible the</font>

205
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:18,160
third one is risk and this one is

206
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,319
challenging one because the risk is

207
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,839
defined as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the danger faced by</font>

208
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,830
production networks during a training

209
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:30,460
session basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we are</font>

210
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,470
talking about what happens when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

211
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,170
conducting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the training session in your</font>

212
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,570
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and suddenly you run</font>

213
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:41,439
a piece of malware maybe it's something

214
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,270
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want at all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

215
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem here and we will see a little a</font>

216
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,670
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later it comes with realism</font>

217
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:51,219
versus risk do we have realistic

218
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,360
sessions or do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe sessions</font>

219
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:57,160
which

220
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,800
as a dilemma like I said we see the

221
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,010
other ganization tend to minimize risks

222
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:08,189
so this means that they will go for less

223
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:18,640
realistic we could say sessions and

224
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:22,200
favor<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> favor less risk as well the</font>

225
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,120
fourth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last criterion is realism</font>

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,560
and this is the level of<font color="#CCCCCC"> detail that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

227
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,110
training environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> replicate</font>

228
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,869
replicates based on what a real case

229
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,950
would be here we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

230
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,620
another challenging criterion because if

231
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,380
you want to train in a good manner in a

232
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,110
realistic manner well you need relevant

233
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,439
cases and relevant cases will require

234
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,839
running maybe a piece of malware and

235
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,519
well basically is what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

236
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,589
find when a real security incident

237
00:11:51,519 --> 00:12:00,430
happens in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so if you want</font>

238
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:03,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">to run some sessions in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safer manner</font>

239
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:07,899
for example with keeping a high degree

240
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,490
of realism with with malware samples you

241
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,260
will probably have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend some time</font>

242
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,140
reverse engineering and understanding

243
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,130
what piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented</font>

244
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,890
there otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could face security</font>

245
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,560
incident during the the actual training

246
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,890
session if you're conducting it in in a

247
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,589
live environment from the ideal

248
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:33,550
perspective once again we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should try to</font>

249
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:42,120
maximize realism just to once again try

250
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:44,949
to a train like you fight so the

251
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,560
challenges that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I presented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before they</font>

252
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:50,199
tend to present themselves as dilemmas

253
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,260
we have three the first one is

254
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,170
efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus realism and this is</font>

255
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,350
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have less costs when preparing</font>

256
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,300
and conducting training sessions however

257
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,480
we are going to impact the realism of

258
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,130
the session think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example where</font>

259
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> redo</font>

260
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,230
is recorded network traffic you capture

261
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in network a and when you try to</font>

262
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,770
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in your network it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

263
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,689
have mismatches for example network

264
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:24,760
addresses architecture and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font>

265
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we think about what companies are going</font>

266
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do when they face this dilemma is to</font>

267
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,670
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's better to run a little bit</font>

268
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,109
more efficient because we have you know

269
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:42,130
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the budget as</font>

270
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:46,210
well the second dilemma is risk versus

271
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:49,630
realism and this is try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have less</font>

272
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:53,650
risky sessions but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time less</font>

273
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:57,189
realistic as well and the ideal

274
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,870
situation here is to train in<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

275
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,970
environment where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your</font>

276
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,460
production infrastructure so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

277
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,130
what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find during a an</font>

278
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,920
incident and also with real indicators

279
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:12,580
so you see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually would happen</font>

280
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,310
during an incident so the dilemma once

281
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,610
again if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have real malware samples in</font>

282
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,160
our environment well people or

283
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,120
organizations will tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the</font>

284
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,650
training sessions in isolated labs or

285
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,920
maybe on their own with some virtual

286
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:32,829
machines visual boxin and so on so forth

287
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:36,040
which tends to reduce the realism at the

288
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:39,190
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we are going for production</font>

289
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,280
environments then running uncontrolled

290
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:44,380
malware is a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk therefore we</font>

291
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,730
either have to spend time<font color="#E5E5E5"> preparing the</font>

292
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,590
session reverse engineering and so on or

293
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,350
reuse pieces of malware which are

294
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:57,630
harmless oh that could potentially have

295
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:01,360
no impact at all if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> face the dilemma</font>

296
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,670
most companies will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we are</font>

297
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to minimize risk and at the same</font>

298
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:12,189
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> well just live with less realistic</font>

299
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:15,940
sessions the last dilemma is going to

300
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:18,760
face risk and cost and usually if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

301
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,310
want to have less risky sessions you

302
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,410
will have to spend more

303
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,660
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the time that you</font>

304
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,579
spend on the reverse engineering testing

305
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,370
may be buying commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> red team</font>

306
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:33,430
software which can allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to simulate</font>

307
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,460
malware you know in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> safer manner so</font>

308
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:40,209
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to just skyrocket your</font>

309
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:44,950
your costs on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand if you tend</font>

310
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:48,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run on on a lab or isolated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

311
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,680
segments this might require maybe extra

312
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">hardware extra infrastructure we're</font>

313
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about fire wall switches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

314
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:03,040
licenses and so on so when we faced a

315
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay risk versus cost organizations will</font>

316
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,860
go probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> for costs once again we try</font>

317
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,470
to minimize risk but spending more money

318
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,860
is not a synonym for better especially

319
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,170
from the vendor's perspective basically

320
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,110
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are training people and</font>

321
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:23,140
you see that the training is costing too

322
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:27,580
much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will prioritize other tasks or</font>

323
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:31,960
other IT areas before and at the same

324
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:34,180
time if the organization is spending a

325
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,610
lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in the in their</font>

326
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,439
training program they will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

327
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:43,780
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe once or twice a year instead of</font>

328
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:46,660
doing it regularly so the common

329
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:50,290
situation today is that we have training

330
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,719
sessions full of<font color="#CCCCCC"> either/or decisions you</font>

331
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just you have to find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise</font>

332
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:01,540
if you want to to do it in a more or

333
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,420
less efficient manner so from our

334
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,389
perspective ideal training sessions

335
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,130
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> low difficult tip when we</font>

336
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,450
are thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the implementation of</font>

337
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:15,280
the scenarios it should have a low cost

338
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:19,060
at the same time they should have very

339
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,359
high realism and mean no risk at all for

340
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> production networks so our</font>

341
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,449
contribution to this is the blue team

342
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:30,580
training tool kits and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

343
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:33,340
toolkit built on two pillars the first

344
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,960
one is represent

345
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,760
or using other solid replication

346
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,740
techniques so we can keep a higher

347
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,350
degree of realism during the training

348
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,450
sessions and at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time keep</font>

349
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,219
reusability in mind so we can lower the

350
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,950
cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product of the training</font>

351
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:51,580
session so you can reuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> it over and</font>

352
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:56,950
over and at least get you a better

353
00:17:51,580 --> 00:18:00,520
return on investment so the goal here is

354
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,210
to solve the challenges that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I presented</font>

355
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,580
before and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring these</font>

356
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys here medium-sized businesses</font>

357
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,889
universities small businesses and

358
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,720
individuals up here to the level where

359
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,420
large corporations are having full

360
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,280
benefits from conducting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Team</font>

361
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,700
engagements others are you simulation

362
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,990
and and so on it's important to

363
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the blue team training</font>

364
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,130
tool kit is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that red team</font>

365
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,950
replacement in other words if you are

366
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:32,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">training and if you are a blue team your</font>

367
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,030
goal is to withstand the attack of a red

368
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,910
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I say here the tactics</font>

369
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,750
techniques and procedures are very

370
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">important and this is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

371
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:50,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that red team can deliver not a tool so</font>

372
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,050
the toolkit is written in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python and</font>

373
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,090
like I said it focuses right now on

374
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:58,000
other side of replication malware

375
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:01,270
simulation and reducing network traffic

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,310
by allowing manipulation and replay the

377
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,639
toolkit uses a<font color="#E5E5E5"> command-line interface</font>

378
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,950
which is it reminds the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit net</font>

379
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,170
framework which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

380
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,200
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience with the framework you</font>

381
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:17,410
should be up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in no time it</font>

382
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,350
also helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue team cooperation if you</font>

383
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,230
are in a group of companies or if you

384
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,810
have for example companies that

385
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,790
cooperate with in the same industry the

386
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:32,139
energy sector for example at least in

387
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:35,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Norway here you can exchange pick up</font>

388
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,420
data network traffic so they can run

389
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:40,470
training sessions once again even in a

390
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,470
much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

391
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,830
so the toolkit has right now two main

392
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,580
tools we have maligno running on version

393
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:54,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">3 which allows you to simulate malware</font>

394
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:58,470
risk-free and you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility</font>

395
00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:00,280
to customize the command<font color="#CCCCCC"> and control</font>

396
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,070
indicators that you will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

397
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,070
network at the same time we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick up</font>

398
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,020
teller which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit behind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

399
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in diversion and this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

400
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,520
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> customize traffic and</font>

401
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,990
replay that like i<font color="#E5E5E5"> said is basically</font>

402
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,750
designed for blue team's but the

403
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,120
functionality could become handy

404
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,880
especially on advanced security

405
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:29,340
engagements we are talking about other

406
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:41,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry simulation or rectum engagements</font>

407
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:43,539
so let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the demos so let me</font>

408
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">present you the lab that we have over</font>

409
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:48,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">here we have a kali linux machine which</font>

410
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:50,530
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the blue team training</font>

411
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,429
tool kit and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play the</font>

412
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:58,480
role in this case as an attacker or a

413
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:00,280
stay command and control server first of

414
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,280
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to say that the blue team</font>

415
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,200
training tool kit is using a

416
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,830
client-server architecture so this will

417
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,230
be hosting the server part we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

418
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:14,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to machine here which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

419
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:17,169
to play the victim role when we simulate

420
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,908
the infection and at the same time we

421
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your instance here</font>

422
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:32,760
monitoring the network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have set</font>

423
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:36,580
up here so let's get in and like I said

424
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,520
the blue team training training tool kit

425
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:43,870
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a command-line interface can you see</font>

426
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,539
that by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which is using a</font>

427
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,729
syntax and you know commands which are

428
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:53,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">very alike to what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

429
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,010
framework are is using so

430
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,950
we have made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modules so</font>

431
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:01,909
we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the first demo with</font>

432
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:05,169
the molecular module so we will focus on

433
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:19,159
attack simulation with customized

434
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:23,149
indicators so maligno is using a server

435
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:26,750
on this computer and we can customize

436
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:30,559
their type of indicators by using

437
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,450
malware profiles so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a look at</font>

438
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,500
the profiles here there are a few which

439
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:39,799
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> built in we are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how</font>

440
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:47,419
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are made by the way hmm so here we</font>

441
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:50,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a folder with profiles and if we</font>

442
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:55,539
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the contents what we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

443
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:58,010
Python script divided in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few classes</font>

444
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:00,110
basically the first one having some

445
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:03,110
background information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the de mal</font>

446
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,600
world profile we have a request part

447
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,240
where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to prepare all the</font>

448
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,908
indicators that the piece of malware

449
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,390
simulating the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual malware is</font>

450
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:18,320
going to send to the command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

451
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:22,039
server on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand the response is</font>

452
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,168
going to list all the indicators that

453
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:29,149
the server is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to send to the</font>

454
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:32,360
client finally we have a network area

455
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:34,699
here where we can define specifics for

456
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,070
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they the communication is going to</font>

457
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,860
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the delay from</font>

458
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:42,559
request to request that the client is

459
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send to the server or if there</font>

460
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:51,889
is any specific and coding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

461
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:57,220
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use for the response body so in this</font>

462
00:23:51,890 --> 00:24:00,350
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have taken some indicators</font>

463
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,970
information from a report released by

464
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:07,010
Simon take some time ago explaining

465
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:09,920
things about the dragonfly

466
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:13,370
campaign that was targeting western

467
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,190
energy suppliers and in this report

468
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:19,580
there is a bacterial<font color="#CCCCCC"> audrea also known</font>

469
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:23,150
as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Hague extrusion and they were</font>

470
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:27,530
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here specific indicators of post</font>

471
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:33,260
request and response so what I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

472
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:36,110
was to implement those indicators here

473
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:41,690
in the profile so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

474
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:43,929
place so let's try to seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

475
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,930
case

476
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:12,908
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything ready we are going</font>

477
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:17,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use HTTP protocol so we can actually</font>

478
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:19,450
inspect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic in a in an easy</font>

479
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:22,779
way and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have all the</font>

480
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:26,980
settings ready we re ready to generate a

481
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:30,580
client this client should be deployed on

482
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:35,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machines that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to simulate us</font>

483
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:37,570
infected even though this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font>

484
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,549
script you could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> PI installer for</font>

485
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,799
example if you want to compile it and

486
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:47,590
deploy that in our windows machine for

487
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:54,029
example so we are ready so we can run

488
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:54,029
and if we go here to the victim machine

489
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:08,980
the client will try to connect to the

490
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:12,249
hmm to the server to the command and

491
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">control server by using the settings and</font>

492
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:17,470
all the indicators that we have

493
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:19,889
specified in the profile if we go back

494
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,409
here to the server we see that there are

495
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:25,529
requests coming in the good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

496
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:28,690
the profiles is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> since they are</font>

497
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:31,359
script written in Python you can

498
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,669
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> make your own logic if you want</font>

499
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,340
so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your eyes</font>

500
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:38,859
completely random you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or if</font>

501
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,678
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do it in a much more we</font>

502
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:44,408
could say off you skated way you can do

503
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">it as well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can and you know keep</font>

504
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:49,210
your blue team hunting if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want with</font>

505
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,249
different stuff that you know you can

506
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:55,809
plan for your sessions if we go to the

507
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:58,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Security online instance we see that one</font>

508
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:02,139
alert has been triggered in this case

509
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:05,668
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> Becks rat and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the</font>

510
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:05,668
contents of these communications

511
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:23,640
try to compare what we have here in the

512
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:28,500
report on what is actually being sent so

513
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:31,410
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go okay so if we have a look</font>

514
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:35,370
at the client requests basically all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

515
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:38,220
headers the host content lengths user

516
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,739
agents you arise everything is like the

517
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,500
report said and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the</font>

518
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,200
response is pretty much the same there

519
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,980
are few glitches on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe on the</font>

520
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,320
order of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the headers basically</font>

521
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,840
like I said this is fully customizable

522
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,030
so you can do whatever you want with the

523
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:09,600
responses and whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

524
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:12,690
in in here so let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop this one</font>

525
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,929
more comment on the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> the maligno</font>

526
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,610
client is proxy aware which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

527
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,860
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running with proxies it's</font>

528
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,959
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to find the proxy</font>

529
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,800
either with the static configurations or

530
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,170
with a view pad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to say that</font>

531
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> W pad implementation is not a</font>

532
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,730
standard one but the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

533
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,360
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet even if a</font>

534
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,010
company is having misconfigurations or

535
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,229
not using a standard set up in their

536
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,800
networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have found a few cases and</font>

537
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:52,590
that's why I went for them for this

538
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:57,720
alternative so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stop hmm I'm</font>

539
00:28:52,590 --> 00:29:00,169
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clear the alert here and let's</font>

540
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,170
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

541
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:12,679
case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to focus on the next</font>

542
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,679
demo which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use pickup teller</font>

543
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:22,080
the idea behind a pickup teller is to

544
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:27,139
get network traffic that has been

545
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:30,960
previously recorded and have at least

546
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:32,758
the capacity to change those indicators

547
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,729
that typically are important<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

548
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,989
analyzing traffic we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about IP</font>

549
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:43,609
addresses MAC addresses may be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

550
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:47,899
fragmentation and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forth so</font>

551
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:51,059
here in the installation folder of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

552
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:56,908
training tool kit we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> folder</font>

553
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:58,979
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> profiles sorry pickups where we</font>

554
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:02,669
can add all the pickup's that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

555
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:04,619
work with so in this case I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

556
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:06,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">use this demo that pickup which is</font>

557
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,970
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic related to a ransomware</font>

558
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:10,979
infection and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten from</font>

559
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,190
Margaret Margaret traffic analysis of

560
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:13,190
net

561
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,620
so the first example is going to show us

562
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:39,480
how we can run just a simple a packet

563
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:42,240
replay basically just before we do that

564
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:47,700
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here in security onion</font>

565
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:50,400
so when we run the through the traffic

566
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we inject it to the network we see</font>

567
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everything goes really fast just</font>

568
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">within a second as you can see here and</font>

569
00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:01,350
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the alerts triggered in</font>

570
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,810
the ideas they are basically what we

571
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:06,120
expected it's a the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack chain until</font>

572
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,330
we get infected on the ransomware is

573
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,820
communicating in this case we see that

574
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the events have come in the same</font>

575
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,700
second so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that from</font>

576
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:22,230
our realism perspective is not too good

577
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:25,140
we have methods for improving that we

578
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:27,360
can of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course come into this you know</font>

579
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:45,950
pivot on there on the traffic see the

580
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:45,949
transcript<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here we have an example</font>

581
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:53,879
so it's quite simple if we want to

582
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,750
improve in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> the realism we</font>

583
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:01,530
could try the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time option in the</font>

584
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:05,580
pickup<font color="#E5E5E5"> teller module in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this case we can</font>

585
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:09,420
set a real time to true<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font>

586
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to honor the inter</font>

587
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,980
packet arrival time in other words how

588
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,889
fast or how slow the packets were

589
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,820
actually sent during the when the attack

590
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:24,770
scenario was recorded was captured so in

591
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,770
this case we can run again

592
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,320
and that we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is going</font>

593
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:33,049
to take a little bit a little bit longer

594
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,989
so just in a moment we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

595
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:42,759
events popping up much more you know

596
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:45,309
scaled so we see now it was 5 07 12 13

597
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:49,669
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to actually follow the</font>

598
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:51,769
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the packets we're having</font>

599
00:32:49,669 --> 00:33:02,599
at the time of recording the network

600
00:32:51,769 --> 00:33:09,529
traffic so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give it a moment</font>

601
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:12,249
hmm if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we open wireshark we should see</font>

602
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,249
the traffic flowing

603
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's see still there so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

604
00:33:46,000 --> 00:34:01,230
see a few DNS requests to whatever com

605
00:33:50,850 --> 00:34:03,790
so while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the idea let's stop</font>

606
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,960
like I said it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take some some</font>

607
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:16,060
time so let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed it up that's</font>

608
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:18,429
clear again so so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a specific</font>

609
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,440
attack scenario in a pickup so if this

610
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:24,190
is a story it's like when you're

611
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,520
watching a movie and well you say well i

612
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,320
hope i wish i could be the actor you

613
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,050
know kissing that lady or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

614
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:35,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the idea here is to try to bring</font>

615
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:38,710
that into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scenario that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

616
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:48,070
use during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the training so here we have</font>

617
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:51,909
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> options which can help us pointing</font>

618
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:55,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the IP addresses which are contained</font>

619
00:34:51,909 --> 00:35:00,279
in the pickup file another one focusing

620
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the mac addresses and here we see the</font>

621
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">wire or the information that should be</font>

622
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:09,190
flowing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire while we are</font>

623
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:12,880
conducting a training session so here i

624
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:17,310
have a neutrino attack scenario it's an

625
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:21,010
exploit kit delivering an attack and

626
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:26,560
here i hope you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

627
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:33,460
scenario where this computer 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 621 104</font>

628
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:35,320
is being attacked by 62 138 139 110 so

629
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take these two addresses</font>

630
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,500
and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to replace them with</font>

631
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,500
something random

632
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:14,580
so yes to make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear I will</font>

633
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:20,550
replace those addresses with let's say

634
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:23,790
for example 10 11 12 13 and the attacker

635
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:32,430
machine with four four five five six six

636
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:34,890
seven seven so it's easy to to see at

637
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:39,960
the same time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go a little bit</font>

638
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:42,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">further and check over here the mac</font>

639
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,180
address in this case of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infected</font>

640
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,450
machine or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim so we are</font>

641
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,480
going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to replace these address as</font>

642
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,480
well

643
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:49,130
so we are going to replace 00080 21 c-47

644
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:52,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">AAA with deadbeef so we are ready we are</font>

645
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,250
going to read as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well set the pick up</font>

646
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:54,250
name

647
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:28,540
and let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started everything should</font>

648
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:33,520
be clear so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can see one example</font>

649
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:37,630
coming with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client 10 11 12 13</font>

650
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the same over there apply to the</font>

651
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:43,990
attacker in this case 4 4 5 5 and so on

652
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,130
if we take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the traffic hearing</font>

653
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:54,609
white shark we should also see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

654
00:38:48,130 --> 00:39:11,980
mac address let's see if it was

655
00:38:54,610 --> 00:39:27,240
correctly written 100080 21 c-47<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

656
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:27,240
sorry it was a live demos sorry for that

657
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so if we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back here to scale we</font>

658
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:56,880
should see the thing for as well and if

659
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a look at the MAC addresses</font>

660
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:22,230
hopefully now I didn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any mistakes</font>

661
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there we see deadbeef okay so a few</font>

662
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">tips especially for the red team's well</font>

663
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,910
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing especially on the</font>

664
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:34,020
maligno module this is now using

665
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,810
communications as you see which can be

666
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,000
customized with your indicators but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

667
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">about if we could even take it further</font>

668
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,560
and inject payloads a well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a the</font>

669
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,560
feature which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not implemented right</font>

670
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,490
now in version 3 however maligno to

671
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:54,420
where the version 2 is a standalone tool

672
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:57,180
which supports both flexible command and

673
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,220
control server communications plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay</font>

676
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:09,930
inject or whatever you want it will come

677
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:12,990
as mentioned here in the next versions

678
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:15,779
of the blue team training tool kit in

679
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:18,720
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that have you ever been in a</font>

680
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,720
situation where you have our tights blue

681
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,089
team looking at everything and you need

682
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,009
some sort of diversion so you can do

683
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:29,580
what you need to do in the network

684
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:32,640
without being detected well if you have

685
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:36,509
these kind of situations like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have had</font>

686
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes you can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

687
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:43,380
network diversions by recycling or

688
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:45,480
reusing network traffic let me give you

689
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,780
an example if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a foothold in a</font>

690
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,910
network and you have VPN people thing in

691
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,480
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually cobalt strike or</font>

692
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit bro</font>

693
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,570
they have these these features so when

694
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:02,879
you have your VPN server running on the

695
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,910
client you will have a virtual interface

696
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,330
on your machine if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you inject traffic on</font>

697
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:11,279
that interface with pick up Taylor the

698
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:13,440
traffic will be sent to the target

699
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,930
Network and if you have security

700
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,320
countermeasures or for detection in

701
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:22,140
place that traffic should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> visible and</font>

702
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:24,330
it should trigger alerts over there so

703
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,810
at that time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font>

704
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:31,049
feature and pick up Taylor to get the

705
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:34,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack chain more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic and maybe</font>

706
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:36,450
while this<font color="#E5E5E5"> diversion is occurring in the</font>

707
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,509
network you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on and do whatever</font>

708
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:44,430
you need to do without being detected or

709
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:48,960
at least hiding in plain<font color="#E5E5E5"> sight if you</font>

710
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:52,290
try using real<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses MAC</font>

711
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,310
addresses and so on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up taylor</font>

712
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:58,320
module will also address the packets to

713
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right destinations and if you have</font>

714
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,450
routers in place provided there are no

715
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,220
firewall rules and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and routers</font>

716
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,990
will just wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so if you have</font>

717
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">different segments the traffic will flow</font>

718
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:15,930
from one to another provided once again

719
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:18,090
the network is allowing that so where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

720
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:21,419
find it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go to encrypt Oh dr. now</font>

721
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:23,640
/ tools there you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

722
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,440
tools that we have released in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition</font>

723
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:30,150
to the blue team training<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool kit and</font>

724
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,610
well if you have any questions I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

725
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,610
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them thanks</font>

726
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:53,040
yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is if we can't</font>

727
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,550
export resource files just to maybe make

728
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:01,140
things more automatic I can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

729
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:03,390
maligno version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 it does that this one</font>

730
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,750
is has not the feature yet but it will

731
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,790
come the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up well an</font>

732
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,270
environment which is known to most

733
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:14,700
security professionals and in this way

734
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:17,009
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> again have less preparation time</font>

735
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:27,330
while preparing your training session so

736
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:29,070
if it will come yeah so the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

737
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:31,860
if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool is going to be updated with</font>

738
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:34,950
new profiles and so on every time I

739
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,880
release on new version I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to include</font>

740
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:41,609
something new for example profiles or a

741
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,100
cool functionality so I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do</font>

742
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:46,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as you saw before they are</font>

743
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,089
Python scripts so even the community

744
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,500
could actually exchanged and that's the

745
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:54,270
idea so you you can do it in a in a much

746
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">more efficient way if you can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pick</font>

747
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,610
what you want and for the simulation

748
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay then thanks</font>

749
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,470
you
