00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,890
I am Jess I'm talking today about

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:09,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">impostor syndrome in the industry and I</font>

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:12,000
wrote this originally as a blog post and

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,530
gave it that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like stupid title I</font>

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,480
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the foresight to</font>

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,669
think that I would be giving it as a

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,520
conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation and standing up</font>

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,330
next to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question saying with the real</font>

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,150
impostor please stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so yeah set</font>

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,038
myself up for a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> before with that one</font>

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,380
but anyway and for those of you who

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,570
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who i am and i will just</font>

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,350
quickly introduce myself before getting

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,530
on to the talk i am dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jessica Barker</font>

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,899
I'm not this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doctor but this</font>

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,860
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doctor which means i can't help</font>

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,579
when this happens because my work is so

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,449
much more serious i work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font>

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">security but i am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not one of these and</font>

20
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:59,250
I'm not one of these and I don't often

21
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:05,250
go to work dressed like this usually

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:08,520
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a treat for casual Fridays I am NOT</font>

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,270
a technologist by background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and instead</font>

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,158
i am<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sociologist so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with people</font>

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,850
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people work on the human</font>

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,369
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security i am a consultant</font>

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,408
if you ask google image search what that

28
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,080
is you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out that i solve</font>

29
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,299
puzzles<font color="#E5E5E5"> i create success and then i</font>

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,658
solve puzzles and everyone gives me high

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,820
fives and fist bumps and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

32
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,460
get to do fun stuff apart from the j job

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,309
like this so speaking events and you'll

34
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,199
see me speaking on TV sometimes talking

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,110
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity stuff you will see</font>

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,110
me looking shocked and

37
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:54,149
you will see me looking so hungry you

38
00:01:51,749 --> 00:02:03,568
will see me looking very disappointed

39
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:06,179
and sometimes really really sad when I

40
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:08,640
am NOT doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity as you all</font>

41
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:10,890
know it creates stress it's a busy job

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,260
so I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let off steam by doing</font>

43
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,500
stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you all thought I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,760
joking about casual Friday and stuff

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,730
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff like this which is a new</font>

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:31,769
one and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like making stuff like this</font>

47
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:36,720
alarm clock not bomb this kitchen timer

48
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:38,220
and a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> jewelry as well and i also</font>

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,739
occasionally seals steal stuff from

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,129
people for example today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i stole this</font>

51
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,590
intro from freaky clown not the content

52
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:52,290
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> he doesn't look so good at</font>

53
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,819
holding the gun<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but yeah they say</font>

54
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,319
imitation is the sincerest form of

55
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:02,488
flattery so you're welcome now to get on

56
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,319
with the talk and as I've said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

57
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,519
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> imposter syndrome I'm</font>

58
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,888
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

59
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">impostor syndrome is I am NOT an expert</font>

60
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:14,280
in imposter syndrome and by which i mean

61
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,549
like professionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not an expert</font>

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,519
it's not like my field of study<font color="#E5E5E5"> or work</font>

63
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:24,109
or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so just a bit of a</font>

64
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,660
summary / what imposter syndrome means

65
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:30,840
it was a team that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was coined by clemson</font>

66
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,418
teams in the late 70s and it generally

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,970
sums up like an inability to internalize

68
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,370
success so that feeling of being a fraud

69
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,650
of being kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of waiting to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be caught</font>

70
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,480
out and so and it doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

71
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">much success you have it doesn't matter</font>

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,160
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> qualifications certifications</font>

73
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,650
how much experience and you constantly

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,150
feel like it's just luck or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

75
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,010
that you're a nice person it's just that

76
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,039
people like you they take pity on you

77
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so you go through life kind of</font>

78
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,250
feeling like you're waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be caught</font>

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,080
for someone to

80
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">rock up one day and be like yeah you</font>

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,710
don't know what you're talking about go

82
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:10,410
home it is according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the literature</font>

83
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,810
it's it's kind of deemed a personality

84
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,600
trait or part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> personality rather</font>

85
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,670
than like a mental disorder and but

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,589
later on I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get into a little bit of</font>

87
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,240
a discussion about where it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

88
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:25,440
crosses over into mental health

89
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,850
traditionally in the literature it's

90
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,700
seen as something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that affects women</font>

91
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,410
much more than men<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was seem like</font>

92
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,900
that for decades and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then recently</font>

93
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's been challenged a bit more and</font>

94
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,280
recent research suggests that it affects

95
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,890
men just as much as women and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,190
wonder if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a reputation of</font>

97
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,200
affecting women more than men because

98
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,030
generally stereotypically women talk

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,010
about their emotions more than men women

100
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,409
will admit to having feelings more than

101
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,789
men and so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> women have just felt</font>

102
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,360
more comfortable speaking up about it

103
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in the past the men have and I'm</font>

104
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about my own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of</font>

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,760
research around it which is very much

106
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,310
connected to this field which as we know

107
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,780
is a male-dominated so from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

108
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,090
understanding from the research i've

109
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,289
done it certainly affects men as much as

110
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:15,539
women<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so as i've said i did a little</font>

111
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of research on this and it was just</font>

112
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,540
a Twitter poll but it ended up being

113
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,359
quite popular had quite a big response

114
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,669
and I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a few</font>

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,080
conversations with people and they were

116
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,760
either saying to me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they felt like</font>

117
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">this they were either struggling with</font>

118
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,110
the fact and that they felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they</font>

119
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,540
didn't belong in the industry they felt

120
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,880
like they didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much as</font>

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,160
everyone around them and they felt kind

122
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,390
of stressed out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or I was</font>

123
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were recruiting</font>

124
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,860
and who were having an issue recruiting

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
people having an issue convincing people

126
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,729
that they were good enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,700
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was being you know discussed</font>

128
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:54,270
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them or even offered to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

129
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,680
just did a random tweet and asking

130
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">people how often they feel imposter</font>

131
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,200
syndrome and as you can see I got over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

132
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,780
hundred responses and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest</font>

133
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,770
response was all the time or daily and

134
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,530
and just just after that was often or

135
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,049
weekly and the lowest response was never

136
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,460
and so seems to me you know

137
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,620
sixty-four percent of people are feeling

138
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,000
this on a very regular basis in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

139
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,080
industry so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it was something</font>

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">with exploring a little bit more um as</font>

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,800
well as the responses to the pole<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

142
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:30,479
got a lot of discussion coming coming

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,370
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tree and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me was was</font>

144
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,930
probably the most beneficial part of it

145
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,000
and so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch on that</font>

146
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,949
now and before doing a bit of a

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,659
discussion on what I think the causes

148
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,479
are particularly in relation to this

149
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:44,370
industry and what if you are struggling

150
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,669
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and or if you know people who</font>

151
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:51,900
are what you can do and to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make</font>

152
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:53,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">it better so one thing that was</font>

153
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly noticeable in the responses</font>

154
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,900
loads of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people came back and as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

155
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,879
voting on it to comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say that</font>

156
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,289
they struggled with it and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

157
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,629
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was noticeable was that some of</font>

158
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:07,860
those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> successful in the</font>

159
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:09,629
industry and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very well-known and</font>

160
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,190
you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people even said the more</font>

161
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,009
successful they become the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more they</font>

162
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,780
struggled with it ben hughes he and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

163
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,599
had quite a discussion around it and

164
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,758
then he went on about a week or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so after</font>

165
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> poll to write a really good article</font>

166
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,080
about his experiences with impostor

167
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,310
syndrome and so if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

168
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,719
you're interested in if it is something

169
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're experiencing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would definitely</font>

170
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:33,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend having a look at ben's article</font>

171
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,400
on it and there was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

172
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,740
discussion as to why<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel this</font>

173
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,948
way and why we think it's particularly

174
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,440
prevalent in information security and

175
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:45,270
and for some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

176
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,669
I can very much relate to this one and

177
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,460
from Chris where he has a background

178
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:54,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that isn't typical and in cyber security</font>

179
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,219
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then has gone on to working and</font>

180
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,569
writing about the field and so that can

181
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,759
feel a little bit odd<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know that</font>

182
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,990
I've certainly had that in the past as i

183
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,479
said i come from a sociological

184
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,930
background and so you can kind of feel

185
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,370
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a fish out of water and</font>

186
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,259
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> this feeling of like building</font>

187
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,659
people up and then knocking them down

188
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:18,000
and which we contend to do quite

189
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:19,889
enthusiastically and the idea we're

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,889
expected to know about so much stuff and

191
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,960
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet a specialist and you feel</font>

192
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well I don't know as much as that</font>

193
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">person and start to really question</font>

194
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,400
yourself

195
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,340
off and Jack Daniel touched on something

196
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,380
in terms of kind of not being the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

197
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,460
human of industries and I'm going to

198
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while and</font>

199
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,560
it manifests itself differently for

200
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,530
different people and maybe it coming

201
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,719
coming from experience some people

202
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:54,120
manage it or use it as a way to push

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves a bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

204
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,840
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to stop</font>

205
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,310
complacency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drive you forward but for</font>

206
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,720
some people it can be a little bit more

207
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a struggle it can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related to being</font>

208
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,980
out to stress maybe even to depression

209
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,350
and again I'm going to carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a little</font>

210
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,500
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a discussion on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that later and I</font>

211
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,970
really liked this comment is to realize

212
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that everyone else is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making up as they</font>

213
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,450
go along and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font>

214
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,590
particularly in your more junior you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

215
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,990
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everyone knows everything</font>

216
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,250
everyone's really experienced and

217
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,720
actually you come to a point where you

218
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,880
kind of realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe other people</font>

219
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,110
are just like one sheet of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> textbook</font>

220
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,000
ahead of you and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

221
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,950
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this industry and if you</font>

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,450
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as the last slide showed if you</font>

223
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:43,370
if you're feeling imposter syndrome and

224
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:48,780
then you're in pretty good company and

225
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">so causes i used the responses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

226
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,130
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Twitter poll some of my own</font>

227
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,630
thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and experiences and to try and</font>

228
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,740
explore some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the causes and it's</font>

229
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,939
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you think about the</font>

230
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,980
causes of this because they can be

231
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,810
reinforcing so it can be like a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

232
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:06,320
chicken<font color="#E5E5E5"> and egg and situation looking at</font>

233
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,030
the literature and reading around an

234
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">imposter syndrome as i said earlier</font>

235
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,140
there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a belief that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

236
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,090
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your personality that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

237
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,830
of ingrained in in who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are and</font>

238
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't challenge</font>

239
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,360
and improve on it and but there is some

240
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,430
research that suggests it comes from

241
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">your family upbringing and particularly</font>

242
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:29,819
if you've had a successful and or

243
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,900
intelligent sibling in the family and

244
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,070
you've maybe been treated a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

245
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,740
differently or you've heard lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

246
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,810
praise go on that sibling and and your

247
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,020
upbringing has made you feel like you

248
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,790
constantly have to strive to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better</font>

249
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,069
and that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> something coming up</font>

250
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,329
coming from the literature and there's

251
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,920
also an argument which i think is a

252
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,890
really good point about the reinforcing

253
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,390
nature of it so if you suffer with

254
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">imposter syndrome you feel like you have</font>

255
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,740
to work harder and harder you feel like

256
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,810
you and have to keep learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

257
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,920
developing and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

258
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,719
enough to not be caught out and of

259
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">course the more you do that the more you</font>

260
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,350
then find you feel like oh okay well i

261
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,330
wasn't caught out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was just</font>

262
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,320
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i spent like all of last night</font>

263
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,000
like reading and reading a reading

264
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,000
reading reading and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hadn't done</font>

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,620
that I wouldn't have been prepped and I

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,280
would have been caught out so i need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

267
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,110
do even more of that next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time avoidance</font>

268
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,760
this is kind of not talking about it not

269
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,230
admitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and and and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of also</font>

270
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,530
there's an element in the literature

271
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,480
that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will look at will have</font>

272
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,920
kind of mentorship and people who are

273
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,260
mentors who are successful in their

274
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,160
field and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's been one way of trying</font>

275
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deal with the problem but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

276
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,449
then is you can set yourself up for

277
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,460
feeling like this mentor is amazing

278
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">really successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can never be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

279
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,640
them and it can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it worse</font>

280
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,689
and and a desire to be liked so there

281
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,490
was found to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a parallel between</font>

282
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,620

284
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,200
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> around you and so what you will</font>

285
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,640
then do is a mold some people were kind

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of mold their responses and mold what</font>

287
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,510
they say or don't say according to who

288
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,189
they're with and then again you have

289
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,560
that feeling of well<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'd give my</font>

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,330
opinion or if I'd not just nodded along

291
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,849
to what they were saying then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

292
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,530
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been outed as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imposter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so a</font>

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,640
they're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and there's a discussion</font>

295
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,410
about an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue going on everyone has a</font>

296
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,880
consensus of views you might feel

297
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,920
something different or you might have

298
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,860
another idea another angle on it but you

299
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,260
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet because you think well that's</font>

300
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,820
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid viewpoint and then you go</font>

301
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">away like think in few thank God I</font>

302
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,300
didn't talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because then</font>

303
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,540
they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all pointed and laughed</font>

304
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:47,990
at me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so too now</font>

305
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:52,610
hmm talk about I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to relate it</font>

306
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:54,680
particularly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity and why I</font>

307
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,500
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems quite prevalent in our</font>

308
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,579
industry is certainly a factor kind of

309
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,230
throughout professionals and and there

310
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,450
is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of literature suggesting and</font>

311
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation suggesting and that it</font>

312
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:11,450
impacts the law profession and

313
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:13,760
postgraduate students teachers can often

314
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,010
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> imposter syndrome something I read</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the literature around and the law</font>

316
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,819
profession was kind of saying you expect

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,860
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an expert all the time and you</font>

318
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,690
turn up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think okay this is going</font>

319
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,000
to be the day when everyone looks to me

320
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,140
for an answer and I don't have it and I

321
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,130
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seemed that seemed quite</font>

322
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,780
relevant to our industry but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

323
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,950
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter and just some of</font>

324
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">my own thoughts have kind of prompted</font>

325

the next lot of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> causes</font>

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,120

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber security and as i said earlier our</font>

328
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,880
industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> diverse it's very</font>

329
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,490
wide-ranging and it has a huge amount of

330
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,670
different specialisms in it and that can

331
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:55,480
lead to ironically<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurity feelings</font>

332
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,709
of insecurity so you can feel like

333
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,690
whoever you're talking to you turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

334
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,030
conference presentation you talk to

335
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,560
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> at work and wherever you might</font>

336
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,420
be and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person knows</font>

337
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,250
everything inside out in their field

338
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,040
they have this really deep specialism

339
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:13,310
that you can never even hope to attain

340
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,140
and and you suddenly feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fraud</font>

341
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,969
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they belong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

342
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,730
I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that can exacerbate</font>

343
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,470
it and what you do at that time is you

344
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,480
kind of forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are a</font>

345
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,160
specialist because they're a specialist

346
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,860
and what you do might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be completely</font>

347
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">different and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we all need our</font>

348
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,890
different specialisms we're all talking

349
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the need for this industry to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

350
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:36,380
more diverse but we can internalize and

351
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,090
kind of forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when we're</font>

352
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,280
presented with someone who has a real

353
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,350
deep specialist knowledge so

354
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">insecurities i think is definitely kind</font>

355
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,550
of personal feelings of insecurity and

356
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,650
feeling intimidated by the knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

357
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:53,359
others in a field that is particularly

358
00:14:48,650 --> 00:15:03,980
knowledge-based i think is a contributor

359
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:06,290
and this one is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eco so people</font>

360
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,500
often comment on hackers being

361
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">egotistical and the hacker community</font>

362
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,000
being kind of particularly arrogant and

363
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,120
full of itself and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact some people</font>

364
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,029
came back to say that on my impostor

365
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,480
syndrome tweet and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there is a</font>

366
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:26,810
culture of ego and in cyber security and

367
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,079
in hacking and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

368
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,899
two-fold effect one thing can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be people</font>

369
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,239
present an out you know an external ego

370
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,399
and that seems like they're incredibly

371
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,220
full of themselves and they perhaps do

372
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,720
that as a way of masking insecurity is

373
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,990
quite a well-known fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

374
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,149
the biggest egos are the most fragile so

375
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,980
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one element of it but</font>

376
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">also when your existing in a culture</font>

377
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:56,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why ego driven and you can feel</font>

378
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,519
like everyone else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really smart and</font>

379
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,739
is really confident and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can mean</font>

380
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,810
that if you're not so confident and if

381
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,910
you do have these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor</font>

382
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,430
syndrome then that can drive it further

383
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:13,519
and you can feel even more out of place

384
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:15,890
and even more intimidated and there is

385
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,519
also continuingly talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> culture and</font>

386
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:22,010
we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a culture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we are</font>

387
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,750
quite introverted and we spend a lot of

388
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:29,390
time on the internet messing around with

389
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,240
technology and we are not known for

390
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">being the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most social of industries</font>

391
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,970
apart from when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at conference</font>

392
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:39,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">after-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but in general we know we</font>

393
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a culture of being fairly</font>

394
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:45,199
introverted and so then that can again

395
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,240
exacerbate feelings of imposter syndrome

396
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,949
the stuff in the literature that kind of

397
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,380
says the the less you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

398
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:53,689
unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a support base and the</font>

399
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,640
less you communicate and draw support

400
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,170
from people and then the more you're

401
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,699
going to internalize these feelings and

402
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:04,699
the worse that they are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get and</font>

403
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:07,260
we obviously work a lot with technology

404
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,820
and being someone from a source

405
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,619
logical background and who focuses on

406
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,990
the human side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security and</font>

407
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,280
I've noticed things in our industry

408
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,829
where I've sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought well that's</font>

409
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we all focus on the binary you</font>

410
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,470
know we will focus on noughts and zeros

411
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,750
and ones and when in fact some of the

412
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">human stuff can often get overlooked you</font>

413
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,199
know like Holly said in her last talked

414
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,790
solving the fishing problem solving

415
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,010
awareness and behaviors problem is

416
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:35,970
something that this industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> has yet to</font>

417
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:38,280
do and in any way and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this then</font>

418
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">also so it has an impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on users it has</font>

419
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,910
an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the work we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

420
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,280
in organizations and but it also i think

421
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">has an impact on our culture and honors</font>

422
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,020
as individuals and because in a in an

423
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,760
industry that's far more comfortable

424
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,850

429
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:08,689
it gets worse we also work quite a lot

430
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,360
we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work really long hours and</font>

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,730
and this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor syndrome for</font>

432
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,179
me starts to cross over into burnout and

433
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:25,320
issues of stress and burnout and even

434
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,370
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people depression so there's</font>

435
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,169
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a few really good</font>

436
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,179
articles if you're interested and if you

437
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,760
if you concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this relationship</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">between and burnout an impostor syndrome</font>

439
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,990
there's some really good literature on

440
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,970
it and that basically talks about the

441
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,320
more you have impostor syndrome as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

442
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,780
said earlier the more you drive yourself

443
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,210
to learn and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work the more you push</font>

444
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,310
yourself to be better to know more to

445
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,220
work more to prove to yourself and to

446
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,560
others and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are good enough that</font>

447
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,630
you can produce good work and that you

do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> industry the more</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take care of yourself you're</font>

454
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:14,100
working too much you end up stressed and

455
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:15,990
burnt out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we also are an industry</font>

456
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,719
that by its nature focuses on the floors

457
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and we have a culture that</font>

458
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,070
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very critical at</font>

459
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,540
x and that's necessary because that's

460
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,860
that's what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our jobs</font>

461
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,920
we're looking for things that are wrong

462
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,510
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to find flaws and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

463
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,980
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know there's no such thing</font>

464
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,160
as perfection but we're trying to make

465
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,830
everything as good as it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and that</font>

466
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,390
can cross over then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of how we</font>

467
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,770
feel about ourselves and how I feel

468
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,870
about others in the industry in the way

469
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:48,550
that we talk and for me this has a

470
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:53,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship and with the earlier one if</font>

471
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:56,649
I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple and in terms of ego</font>

472
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:59,290
so when we have an industry that's quite

473
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,600
ego driven and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> also is very much</font>

474
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,360
concerned with<font color="#E5E5E5"> floors and being critical</font>

475
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,100
and critiquing things and it can then

476
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,949
combine in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this perfect storm where</font>

477
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,480
sometimes we forget about the people

478
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside of things and we can be very</font>

479
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,010
critical very quick to point when

480
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,510
someone has done something wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for</font>

481
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,610
some people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that they get</font>

482
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,670
they get torn down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that obviously</font>

483
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">can can have an influence and in terms</font>

484
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor syndrome somebody came back</font>

485
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,850
to say that happened to them you know

486
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had some strong criticism when</font>

487
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,209
they've made a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then from</font>

488
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they've not had any problems with</font>

489
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">impostor syndrome and then from that</font>

490
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,040
they suddenly felt like they knew

491
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,399
nothing they made them question their

492
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,560
whole identity so it can have a personal

493
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,090
effect when you face it but also it has

494
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,690
an effect in terms of the culture

495
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,270
because if we build up a culture that is

496
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,220
very critical then people maybe who are

497
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,980
new to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> field and or who are trying</font>

498
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to develop in the field or who are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

499
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">well established can feel really worried</font>

500
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,750
about speaking out can feel really

501
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,820
worried about expressing a different

502
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,590
opinion or sharing their work and

503
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,649
because they worry that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

504
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:13,000
face that same that same tear<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and</font>

505
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:16,150
another issue is around bullying and

506
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,920
being critical isn't bullying and but

507
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,680
sometimes there's different ways of

508
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,760
expressing criticism and critique it was

509
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,610
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing it's a really</font>

510
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,440
positive thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to improve but</font>

511
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes how we express criticism and</font>

512
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,830
could be more positive it could be more

513
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,750
constructive

514
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,980
and sometimes criticism<font color="#E5E5E5"> can spread over</font>

515
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,510
into bullying and this was something

516
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,450
again it particularly came out of the

517
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,279
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter and where people</font>

518
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,380
said they had been bullied<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was maybe</font>

519
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a job it was maybe in their workplace</font>

520
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,909
or went back so far as school and but it

521
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,668
led them with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that feeling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of not</font>

522
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:54,100
belonging and have not ever being good

523
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:55,929
enough and they saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being the</font>

524
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:00,100
the primary cause of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor</font>

525
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:02,350
syndrome an interesting discussion that

526
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,120
came out of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me was people</font>

527
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,469
coming back saying that they didn't feel

528
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,049
imposter syndrome that they never

529
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:12,549
questioned their abilities and that they

530
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:16,059
were perfectly comfortable and and they

531
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:19,418
some people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pointed the finger</font>

532
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,860
up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> another people kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said to me</font>

533
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:22,570
either publicly or privately like I

534
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,120
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an issue with this am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I a</font>

535
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,559
narcissist like is there should I be

536
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,719
doubting myself should I be constantly

537
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,750
questioning myself there is a difference

538
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,159
between impostor syndrome and being a

539
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,740
narcissist you know there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

540
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,909
a scale if you know doing and if you're

541
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,559
not if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have imposter syndrome</font>

542
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:40,990
that doesn't mean you're an arrogant

543
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,090
horrible narcissistic person there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

544
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:47,679
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a balanced level of self esteem</font>

545
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:50,049
that we can and should<font color="#E5E5E5"> all aspire to so</font>

546
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,130
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this and don't worry</font>

547
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,690
that that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's something</font>

548
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong with you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you also needs</font>

549
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,090
like a therapy but for a different

550
00:22:53,769 --> 00:23:02,559
reason and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this worry actually</font>

551
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:04,240
has an impact and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the again it</font>

552
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,830
comes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this egotistical culture</font>

553
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,330
of we can look at this culture and we

554
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,309
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how egotistical it is and we can</font>

555
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I don't want to be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to contribute to that</font>

557
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:17,559
problem and so and it's not faking

558
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">impostor syndrome but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're so</font>

559
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,100
worried about well if I'm confident in

560
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">my abilities does that make me like a</font>

561
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,510
massive idiot and a horrible person and

562
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">a narcissist I don't want to be like</font>

563
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so then you go too far the other</font>

564
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,460
way and and it was in one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font>

565
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,668
pieces of<font color="#CCCCCC"> literature about the law</font>

566
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,559
profession where the author said

567
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:41,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">imposter syndrome comes out of a fear of</font>

568
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,330
Top Gun syndrome like you're so worried

569
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,030
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being the big massive</font>

570
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">attock ego and that you retreat and go</font>

571
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,920
the other way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like the</font>

572
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,820
dunning-kruger effect you know that if

573
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:57,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if you think that you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

574
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,610
really smart and then that must make you

575
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:05,320
really stupid but there is a nice

576
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:08,439
balance it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in it can be quite</font>

577
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,610
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

578
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,010
smart when you're surrounded by

579
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:16,090
stupidity and when there's so many

580
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:18,190
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people being stupid you can</font>

581
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:24,250
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think like okay I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

582
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:26,170
want to be that idiot and this was a

583
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,490
really good thread and somebody on

584
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter pointed me towards and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

585
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sorry i can't remember who</font>

586
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,350
pointed me towards it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was a</font>

587
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,080
really really good thread that I found

588
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,300
really important and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

589
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,669
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a month ago and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody in</font>

590
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,379
America speaking out saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

591
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,700
imposter syndrome like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm quite</font>

592
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,460
confident in what I know and what I

593
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,650
don't know and what I'm struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

594
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,630
is if I say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the room goes</font>

595
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,150
quiet if I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

596
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:55,750
quite good at that and then everybody

597
00:24:52,150 --> 00:25:01,180
like recoils and thinks like okay he's

598
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ego and we'll all avoid him and as</font>

599
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,690
he says you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have confidence and not</font>

600
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,790
be arrogant so if you have an issue with

601
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">impostor syndrome like you can deal with</font>

602
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make yourself feel more</font>

603
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,720
confident and don't worry that that's

604
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:21,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to turn you into an idiot um and</font>

605
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,130
what Marco says when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on and read</font>

606
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,920
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thread is he says and</font>

607
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,840
that particularly for him and confidence

608
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,540
is really important he says that as a

609
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,919
black guy if he doesn't or he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

610
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,350
experienced in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his life that if he</font>

611
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,240
doesn't say i'm good at that no one is

612
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand up for him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say he's</font>

613
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,990
good at that so he particularly related

614
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,150
it to being in a minority and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've heard</font>

615
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,540
similar said about about being female

616
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,100
but if you don't push yourself forward

617
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,659
no one else is going to so when you're

618
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,719
in a minority kind of having confidence

619
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,040
can be can be really important and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

620
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,080
shouldn't be seen something

621
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:07,930
and that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> um arrogant as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

622
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:10,030
before about about stupidity and I said

623
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">my talk was going to be PG I'm hoping</font>

624
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:17,020
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the B word doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like break that</font>

625
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:20,680
rule but when I said earlier about

626
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,389
stupidity what I was referencing was the

627
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,180
tendency in this industry to talk about

628
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,160
users being stupid and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've talked about</font>

629
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,080
that a lot it's one of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> bugbears and</font>

630
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,140
because it really doesn't help me when

631
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,570
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> behaviour</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

632
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,900
awareness around cyber security and that

633
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,070
that the average<font color="#CCCCCC"> person has experts in</font>

634
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,730
cybersecurity telling them that are

635
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,470
stupid but because our industry does

636
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,880
that a lot because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we like to call</font>

637
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,860
people stupid and we like to point the

638
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,780
finger and I've always looked at that

639
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,939
something that damages uses because I

640
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it does and it damages our ability</font>

641
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to communicate with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and but also I</font>

642
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,540
think it damages us and it's part of

643
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,730
that thing of if we're constantly

644
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,080
looking for stupidity and pointing out

645
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,140
stupidity and pointing the finger at

646
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,760
people and then that comes back on us

647
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,130
because we worry about being the one

648
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,300
that is then in the spotlight and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

649
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,290
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> community is turning around and</font>

650
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:19,600
looking at them and saying you're the

651
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid one um so oh how do you deal with</font>

652
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">it if you are struggling with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor</font>

653
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,860
syndrome what can you do to make it

654
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,810
better and to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> your self esteem</font>

655
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,100
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these some of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

656
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,870
again from the literature but a lot of

657
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,520
this is my personal thoughts and

658
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,830
experience stuff that's worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

659
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,220
and also things that came out of the

660
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:41,649
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on Twitter and so this is</font>

661
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,060
a very long like academic thing from one

662
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,770
of the pieces of literature but it it

663
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,100
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the kind of seminal article</font>

664
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,450
on impostor syndrome and and what it

665
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,580
says the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because</font>

666
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,440
the short version of that is it

667
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,379
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> says group therapy really</font>

668
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,720
helps and so talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it in a group</font>

669
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,000
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helps because people</font>

670
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,320
start like sharing their secret this

671
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,910
thing that they've always felt that they

672
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,320
have to keep inside and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can't</font>

673
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,120
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you talk about</font>

674
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,159
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor syndrome it feels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

675
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,750
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting a big flag over your head</font>

676
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,870
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did with my opening scene</font>

677
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,250
saying like I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> imposter and so if</font>

678
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a group</font>

679
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,200
you feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay other people feel</font>

680
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,450
this as well and and you can look at

681
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,680
someone next to you so you can the

682
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,060
reason I've had it in was because this

683
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,700
is what seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen on the Twitter</font>

684
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,470
discussion and so it generated a really

685
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,000
big discussion and then lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

686
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,260
came back saying like yeah I've I've

687
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,180
always felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and I've never</font>

688
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,800
talked about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now I've seen Jack</font>

689
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,630
Daniel talking about it or now I've seen

690
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,850
Rick Ferguson talking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I</font>

691
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,810
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like wow they're amazing they're</font>

692
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:45,939
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known they suffer from it so</font>

693
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,919
you know they're obviously successful

694
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,390
and intelligent so maybe because I

695
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,030
suffer through it from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font>

696
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:54,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that IM stupid and maybe it means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

697
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,170
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so I'm not saying you</font>

698
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,900
necessarily need like group therapy to

699
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,210
feel better but definitely talk about it

700
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,010
create a culture in your workplace where

701
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,950
it's okay to talk about it find people

702
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,480
who feel in a similar way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

703
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,920
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help to build each other up and</font>

704
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,210
just talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your experiences and</font>

705
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,830
this I I put this thing because I just

706
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:18,160
love the phrase I'm not as green as I am

707
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:21,070
cabbage looking and and it kind of

708
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,800
relates so one thing the literature says

709
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,600
is try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and imagine if you're feeling</font>

710
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,139
really stupid try and imagine telling

711
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,780
this person so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like you've</font>

712
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,430
been hired for a job and you're not good

713
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,260
enough for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job try and imagine</font>

714
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,360
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you fooled your</font>

715
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,840
boss basically you've made this person

716
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,610
hire you because you're so good at

717
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,439
pretending to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good you're such a big</font>

718
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:47,080
fraud try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and imagine going to your boss</font>

719
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,000
who hopefully you respect and saying I

720
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,419
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've I've just fooled you into</font>

721
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,950
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> me this job and what your boss</font>

722
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,420
would probably say is one of a few

723
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,250
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you really think I'm that</font>

724
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,840
stupid that you can fool me into

725
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,890
thinking that you're right do you really

726
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,740
think I am as stupid as I look and they

727
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,780
might also say you know like why why

728
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,130
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you why would I be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fooled do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

729
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,570
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I've got the experience and</font>

730
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,800
the knowledge to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when someone is</font>

731
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:16,300
good at something and when they're just

732
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking the mick and another thing people</font>

733
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,530
said particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on twitter is surround</font>

734
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,649
yourself with positive people

735
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:25,060
them so try and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with people</font>

736
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,770
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people try and engage</font>

737
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,580
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who take a more positive</font>

738
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:32,200
outlook on life and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that make</font>

739
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,449
you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you can't talk about</font>

740
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">negative stuff so just because you're</font>

741
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,240
with positive people I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the danger</font>

742
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,260
with this could be you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> then feel</font>

743
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,130
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to be the negative</font>

744
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">one where is it it's not about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

745
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,220
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a support</font>

746
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,650
network and that thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being with</font>

747
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,780
radiators not drains and so people that

748
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:56,370
give you energy give you support rather

749
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:56,370
than take it from you and this one this

750
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:03,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">one's quite close to my heart because I</font>

751
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:08,950
really procrastinated about this talk oh

752
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:10,510
the irony and so procrastination<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font>

753
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,490
experience is really really really

754
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,730
really really bad for<font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor syndrome</font>

755
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:18,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it almost directly comes out of</font>

756
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,080
it so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you can feel like you</font>

757
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,870
don't want to confront your own

758
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,750
stupidity by working on something so you

759
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">just find ways of avoiding it</font>

760
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,180
procrastination is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst thing you</font>

761
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,370
can do because it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel</font>

762
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad it places more stress and pressure</font>

763
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,540
on you so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of beer now it's</font>

764
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,310
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad and so it's better in terms</font>

765
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,700
of imposter syndrome just to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font>

766
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,169
and do it because it has to be done and

767
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,580
the more you produce the more you do

768
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,250
although you don't want to burn out the

769
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,899
more you do and and the more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

770
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,960
tangible results of your work the better

771
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">imposter syndrome can be but i'm going</font>

772
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to contradict myself by saying you also</font>

773
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,200
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks so not</font>

774
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,260
procrastinating and trying to produce

775
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,760
and trying to trying to produce work and

776
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:05,320
content is not saying work all the time

777
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,670
yes that's another really big danger

778
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,820
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor syndrome as i said earlier</font>

779
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,560
in terms of burnout and I'm apologize

780
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,320
for how<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheesy as all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these are but</font>

781
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:17,320
at the same time we all take breaks in

782
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,149
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for different people</font>

783
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,280
relaxing means a totally different thing

784
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people it's like going to yoga</font>

785
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,980
where is for other people it's like

786
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:28,899
playing GTA so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

787
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for some people it's books but you</font>

788
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,190
know whatever it is going for pedicures

789
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,670
and manicures and you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

790
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,210
might be

791
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like just chill out sometimes and but</font>

792
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:43,000
schedule it like don't have a day where

793
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:45,220
you get up and you use like relaxing as

794
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,260
procrastination instead decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

795
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get X Y is that done and then I</font>

796
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,120
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go and go for a walk or I'm</font>

797
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,240
gonna give my cat tummy tickles or

798
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it might be as if you can shed</font>

799
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,850
your tummy tickles with a cat like they

800
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:09,750
just don't relate to a diary and but

801
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:11,800
anyway so take a break this one is about

802
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,090
sometimes you've kind of got a fake it

803
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,210
till you make it and i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

804
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:18,939
about faking skills at all that will not

805
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:22,210
help with<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor syndrome what I'm</font>

806
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,950
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is faking confidence and a</font>

807
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,230
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your emotions</font>

808
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:29,140
drive your behaviors whereas actually

809
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,370
behaviors can drive emotions even says

810
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,930
such a simple thing is like how you

811
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,729
stand whether you stand with like good

812
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,470
posture so whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stand with good</font>

813
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,030
posture or whether you like slump over

814
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,990
can really affect how you feel

815
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:43,060
internally<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if it's about self-esteem</font>

816
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,550
and if it's about confidence sometimes

817
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,440
it is literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> about kind of working</font>

818
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:50,500
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you give off a positive</font>

819
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,760
confident image and then you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

820
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,980
time and I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from experience</font>

821
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,470
that that just kind of becomes

822
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,210
internalized and at some point the

823
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,280
confident image that you've been

824
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:03,310
projecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some extent becomes part</font>

825
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:07,570
of who you are putting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> lipgloss is</font>

826
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:09,400
not obligatory I mean I might personally

827
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,509
recommend it but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

828
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have to do that the most</font>

829
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,300
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like like sometimes</font>

830
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,330
fake it<font color="#CCCCCC"> till you make it with confidence</font>

831
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,760
this one is a key one for me and it's

832
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:24,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually for me like the top tip which</font>

833
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,860
is everyone has or I personally have

834
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:31,030
like loads of to-do lists I have a wall

835
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,500
of to-do lists like literally and that

836
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,580
really keeps me on track and I couldn't

837
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:38,429
like do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything without that</font>

838
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">and and as important as that is is</font>

839
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,810
having a done list and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually keep</font>

840
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:45,899
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> online of my website like hadn't</font>

841
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,389
broken and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually keep online a done</font>

842
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:51,030
list and it will be like projects i've

843
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:54,509
completed events<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've spoken at articles</font>

844
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've done whatever it might be and</font>

845
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,960
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be public or</font>

846
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,610
private keeping track of things that

847
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,200
you've done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflecting on where you</font>

848
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,840
have had achievement somewhere you've

849
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,399
done things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're proud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of is for</font>

850
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,530
me probably the biggest one because

851
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,030
sometimes we can keep driving ourselves

852
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,220
to the next and the next and the next

853
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,660
thing that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this constant</font>

854
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,810
pressure we put on ourselves to produce

855
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,609
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do more work and where is in</font>

856
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,110
fact sometimes it's good to take stock

857
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did that thing</font>

858
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,050
which i completely forgot about and that

859
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really cool and I'm like quite happy</font>

860
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:29,940
with that um this is another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that it</font>

861
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,100
for me at the start you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

862
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,210
that like silly intro<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like oh and I'm</font>

863
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">not working I do this that and the other</font>

864
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:40,700
um I've had lots of hobbies for a while

865
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:43,680
and I that comes out of one I did my PhD

866
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,540
when I did my PhD I also felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

867
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,790
fish out of water because although I'm a

868
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,880
sociologist I was in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of</font>

869
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,890
civic design which is engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

870
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,980
is not really a place for sociologists

871
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:59,970
so I was in there doing a PhD and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt</font>

872
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,310
a bit out of my depth and had some

873
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,509
issues around<font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor syndrome and one</font>

874
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,750
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found really important was</font>

875
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,090
having random hobbies and so I did like

876
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:14,400
ballroom dancing lessons and singing

877
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:17,160
lessons which didn't really pay off but

878
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing anything and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pushes you out</font>

879
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,560
of your comfort zone so stuff there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

880
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,270
not related to work and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fun but</font>

881
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,150
that also pushes you that's why I did

882
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,140
the trapeze thing and recently just

883
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,790
stuff to kind of build up your

884
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">self-esteem and make you feel better you</font>

885
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">know some of it may be connected to work</font>

886
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,910
but one of my biggest pieces of advice

887
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,279
is to make it also not connected to work

888
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,980
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your whole identity and</font>

889
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:47,130
self-esteem isn't tied up in your day

890
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:48,930
job and this slide with the buses is

891
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,480
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Helsinki</font>

892
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:54,000
theory I don't know if anyone is heard

893
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,890
of this and but this is particularly

894
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,839
orientated at people who are at there

895
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,240
near the start of their career or who

896
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,849
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more junior and who might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be feeling</font>

897
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,578
like everything they know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

898
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:07,319
already learnt and so you know what's

899
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:09,030
the point of them learning stuff and

900
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,200
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about stuff because everyone</font>

901
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,059
that they're talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> has already been</font>

902
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done that and you know</font>

903
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:17,280
literally got the t-shirt the Helsinki

904
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,369
bust theory I read<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it in relation</font>

905
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,619
to photographers and in Helsinki when

906
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:24,569
you get a bus out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the city center you</font>

907
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,849
they all take the same route for ages

908
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:29,220
and they all stopped at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same stop</font>

909
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:30,900
and you can feel like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

910
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,290
going to the right destination because

911
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,880
they all go in the same direction so you

912
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,259
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tempted at one point to get off</font>

913
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to the start and to try</font>

914
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,050
and like find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right bus is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this the</font>

915
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,140
right bus for me I don't know if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

916
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:45,270
going money to go and and it is a

917
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,859
parallel with your career where we all

918
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:48,329
go through a stage of learning where

919
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:50,549
we're learning stuff that people have

920
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">learnt before and we feel like we are</font>

921
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,809
never gonna find our niche we're never

922
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,808
going to find our own approach our own

923
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,339
place in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry where is you kind</font>

924
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of have to go through that you have to</font>

925
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,250
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the same Helsinki stops</font>

926
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,629
that other people have gone to and then

927
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,010
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll find that your journey</font>

928
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,650
starts to go off in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different</font>

929
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,049
direction so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is totally normal if</font>

930
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're new ish if you're junior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

931
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:12,660
industry or if you're just starting to

932
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,430
learn about something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't</font>

933
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned about before it's entirely</font>

934
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,470
normal to feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> um like you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

935
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,509
imposter<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with</font>

936
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,689
that we've all<font color="#E5E5E5"> been there we've all felt</font>

937
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that that's part and parcel of</font>

938
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:30,180
being in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry and learning</font>

939
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,819
something new being junior what you have

940
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is just stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the bus and you</font>

941
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:39,000
just have to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

942
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:41,009
and have faith and this ties into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

943
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,530
thing of like sometimes how you project

944
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,240
the things that you and the way you

945
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,099
behave or the things that you say and

946
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,149
can influence how you actually feel

947
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:53,910
internally people with<font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor syndrome</font>

948
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:56,130
there is an argument that and they will

949
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,629
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more apologetic and they will</font>

950
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,859
apologize so much it's like they're

951
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,960
apologizing for their existence

952
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:03,430
and there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of reframing</font>

953
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,309
that so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> always saying sorry</font>

954
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,529
sorry for taking up so much time sorry I

955
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">was late and sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm boring you</font>

956
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:12,940
sorry that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still have to learn this</font>

957
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:15,399
instead it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying thank you so</font>

958
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,079
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for spending this time with me</font>

959
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,369
thank you for helping<font color="#CCCCCC"> me learn this</font>

960
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,739
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having patience while I</font>

961
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:22,329
was late and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has this internal</font>

962
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:24,279
effect where instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> constantly</font>

963
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:28,480
apologizing and constantly basically

964
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:29,739
saying sorry that I'm here instead

965
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,509
you're you're kind of saying I'm

966
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:33,640
grateful and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

967
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:38,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking something from you and and using</font>

968
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:41,618
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a constructive way um and a key</font>

969
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:43,089
thing really is am looking after

970
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:46,059
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said earlier that</font>

971
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:47,410
differs for everybody and you know there

972
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:49,809
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are proven to be true</font>

973
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:52,319
particularly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> imposter syndrome is</font>

974
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:55,569
tying<font color="#E5E5E5"> into burnout and depression and</font>

975
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:57,190
then exercise you know the boring stuff

976
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:58,420
like exercise which can just be like

977
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,279
going for a walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't have to be</font>

978
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,569
like going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the gym and like throwing</font>

979
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:07,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">kettlebells</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around and eating healthily</font>

980
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:09,299
eating well sleeping like making sure

981
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,069
you don't work like nine to five a.m.

982
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:14,349
and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just finding ways to look</font>

983
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:17,319
after yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll build up your</font>

984
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:20,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-esteem and help you and be more</font>

985
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:25,180
resilient against this feeling of being

986
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:27,160
a fraud I said it was PG when I

987
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,019
submitted it so I thought I should I

988
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,029
thought I should not let Robin<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

989
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:33,879
as I think they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing in of</font>

990
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,380
like how rude is your talk I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I put</font>

991
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in because of the keynote last year</font>

992
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,890
with Ricky clown when he swore like

993
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:42,549
every other word so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably</font>

994
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:45,819
should like be good and but there is

995
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:47,890
like a form now of theory that is a form

996
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:51,900
of therapy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is based around this of</font>

997
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,900
like just saying Beckett and

998
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:57,319
and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do that it's</font>

999
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:59,880
like what is the worst that can happen

1000
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:02,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the worst that can happen is if you</font>

1001
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,220
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing and you are found out you</font>

1002
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,989
may lose your job but like you'll you'll

1003
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,118
get another job like literally trace it

1004
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:11,309
down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm going up today and I'm</font>

1005
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor syndrome and</font>

1006
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:15,450
I what's the worst that can happen

1007
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:17,279
before I get up okay i might<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up and</font>

1008
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:20,489
I might forget absolutely everything

1009
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:22,440
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say well at bsides I</font>

1010
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:24,599
got up and presented a slide and I could

1011
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,279
not remember at all what to say on it so

1012
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,589
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just skip to the next slide like life</font>

1013
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:29,999
goes on i'm still here so what's the

1014
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:32,069
worst that can come out of a situation

1015
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:33,808
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really stressed about it think</font>

1016
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:35,489
about that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and get it in</font>

1017
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:39,839
perspective and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font>

1018
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:42,569
day just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yeah i want to thank</font>

there wouldn't have been the blog post

1027
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:59,940
there wouldn't have been the discussion

1028

1047
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,480
to hand over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next speaker so they</font>

1048
00:42:51,100 --> 00:43:07,509
can set up if anyone's got a question

1049
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:10,900
now wave your hand yep yeah yeah and

1050
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,760
yeah of course and so the question was

1051
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,350
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can yo yo in and out of</font>

1052
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,850
imposter syndrome and have some jobs

1053
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:18,220
what you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like cool and fine and</font>

1054
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:20,890
comfortable and other jobs where you and

1055
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:23,259
don't and you feel like terrible about

1056
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,000
yourself or and I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1057
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,490
that's true<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people said that to me</font>

1058
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,140
and I mean there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1059
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">impostor syndrome some people kind of</font>

1060
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,350
say like it's putting a label on

1061
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,760
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be labeled it's</font>

1062
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,430
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being human to doubt</font>

1063
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,470
yourself and I do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some extent</font>

1064
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,480
that's true and so to some extent it's

1065
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,890
normal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a job or a project where</font>

1066
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,180
you're in your comfort zone and it goes

1067
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,379
fine and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a project</font>

1068
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you're out of your comfort zone</font>

1069
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,670
you feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lara and that's that's</font>

1070
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:52,149
kind of normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that goes back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1071
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:54,190
staying on the bus thing and but also I

1072
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,870
think it does fluctuate and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1073
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,430
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about the project you know so</font>

1074
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,200
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a project that</font>

1075
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,210
has paralleled with stuff you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1076
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,620
before we actually you do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1077
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,150
experience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the knowledge but maybe</font>

1078
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,560
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff in your life may</font>

1079
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,480
be the environment the people you're

1080
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,620
working with or maybe just going back to

1081
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,170
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff about stress and</font>

1082
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:12,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">burnout and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of not taking care</font>

1083
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,230
of yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not having the chance to</font>

1084
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,710
take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so other things</font>

1085
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">can definitely impact it and for some</font>

1086
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,500
people it comes completely out of the

1087
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,050
blue so like the guy I said that was

1088
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,760
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine and confident until</font>

1089
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">something went wrong and then ever since</font>

1090
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,540
then he struggled with it even though

1091
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,980
nothing's gone gone wrong again so it

1092
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,390
can sometimes just completely come in

1093
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:35,230
and knock you from the side I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1094
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:37,000
well quick one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart was first</font>

1095
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:43,510
and then I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hand over to the</font>

1096
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:46,250
other speaker congrats you don't you do

1097
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:48,960
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> look it</font>

1098
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:52,320
education with BBC micro and I have no

1099
00:44:48,960 --> 00:45:16,170
formal education at saw inside to do my

1100
00:44:52,320 --> 00:45:18,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">job yeah and so the question was and so</font>

1101
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:23,370
I congratulate him on his on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> young</font>

1102
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:24,990
age<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question was yeah is it</font>

1103
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:27,060
if you've a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have fallen into</font>

1104
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,220
the industry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I did myself a lot</font>

1105
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,900
of other people have and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't</font>

1106
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the kind of qualifications and stuff</font>

1107
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,840
are you more likely to feel imposter

1108
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,910
syndrome<font color="#E5E5E5"> than like the kids coming up</font>

1109
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,020
now who will have liked more formally

1110
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:42,180
studied the industry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subject and</font>

1111
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,820
I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> think falling into it probably</font>

1112
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,230
makes is one factor but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1113
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,520
it's like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that causes it I</font>

1114
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,870
think that's why I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of go</font>

1115
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,430
through the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think loads</font>

1116
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,650
of things can cause it and you can tick

1117
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,180
every box of every qualification and

1118
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,310
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experience and actually</font>

1119
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can make it worse like I sort of</font>

1120
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:01,080
said earlier because that can make you

1121
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,339
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything like</font>

1122
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,000
you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that you should</font>

1123
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:07,500
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> so people expect more of you and</font>

1124
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,150
then if you've kind of fallen into the

1125
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,250
industry and found your<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and then you</font>

1126
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,990
know maybe like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you can get away</font>

1127
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,750
with stuff a little bit more I think

1128
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,310
it's I think it's all down to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1129
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,990
all those other factors more like the

1130
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,080
cultural factors and maybe some of the

1131
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:24,240
personality factors and because we can

1132
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,950
all kind of find a reason as to what

1133
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,810
meat makes as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> imposter and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can</font>

1134
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,480
either be I've got no background in this

1135
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:33,120
so I'm an<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor or I've got a massive</font>

1136
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,220
really like deep background in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

1137
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,960
I still know nothing so that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me an</font>

1138
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,290
imposter so it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of two sides</font>

1139
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've got time for one more question</font>

1140
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:50,450
there were a couple hands that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm</font>

1141
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:50,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">is yep</font>

1142
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,359
yet so the question was when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

1143
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,189
earlier that it was seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1144
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,490
personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> trait is it being recognized</font>

1145
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:06,650
more now by the medical profession for

1146
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,509
example as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mental health issue I think</font>

1147
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:11,150
it's more being recognized as linked to

1148
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:13,490
mental health<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so kind of link to</font>

1149
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,980
anxiety I think in particular and but

1150
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:18,410
also to depression and as i said earlier

1151
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,840
to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of to burnout and exhaustion so</font>

1152
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,839
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be being recognized more and</font>

1153
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:26,210
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that way and I think that for me</font>

1154
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,790
is the the key thing is when it ties in

1155
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:32,200
with other stuff it can be exacerbated

1156
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:34,880
and it can also exacerbate those things

1157
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,529
I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> conscious of time and letting</font>

1158
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,180
the next speaker setup so if there any

1159
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:41,440
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions come find me and we'll</font>

1160
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,440
chat and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you again</font>
