00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,470
haha so is everybody for some car

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:11,519
hacking is grateful is everybody ready

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some car hacking man so I'm sorry</font>

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,420
for the sideline but we're good now hi

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,890
I'm Scott helm and I'm here to talk

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,619
about some research that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,140
seen recently by<font color="#E5E5E5"> departing on hacking a</font>

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,609
car called the nissan leaf<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this</font>

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,990
research with another researcher from

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,140
Australia you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of him</font>

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,000
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Troy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hun i'm here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today to talk</font>

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,230
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual technical details</font>

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,760
behind the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hank that we performed so i</font>

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,589
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a few little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things out</font>

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the way to save some time the QA yes</font>

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,460
i do drive an electric car so it

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,930
slightly better cold than that no it

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,510
isn't a milk<font color="#E5E5E5"> float for those of you that</font>

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,600
into your vehicles it's a common joke<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,339
get how big is the batteries you to the

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,680
next thing that comes up enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font>

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,870
your house for two days or more is the

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,000
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> electricians or hardware</font>

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,250
engineers in here but like details<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,960
electronics we can take up to 50

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,969
kilowatts DC power into this so we are

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,540
playing around with a pretty hefty piece

28
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,850
of equipment people always<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me how</font>

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,790
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll Drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so 70 to 100 miles again</font>

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,679
save the Q&A time later and it cost me

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,240
about to pound 30 to charge it so

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
hopefully that's most of the Q&A out of

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,640
the way darn Dusty's I can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,759
some technical details one of the things

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,619
initially interested me in the car was

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually just how cheap it was but the</font>

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,450
other thing was an application that came

38
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,710
with the car the leaf thanks back to

39
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,450
2011<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he came with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an application</font>

40
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,949
called car wings it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

41
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,630
selling point for the car especially

42
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">island</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frederick north in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pan eyes</font>

43
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,020
typical gets really cold in winter we

44
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,430
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really awesome things like</font>

45
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,890
controlling the air conditioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

46
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,450
heating from the app you look outside

47
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,619
it's snowing in frozen you can crank up

48
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,350
the heating in your car until the ice

49
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,030
itself it's just a lazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT feature</font>

50
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,470
thing but we don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need because</font>

51
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,500
we've lived without it forever but it's

52
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,570
cool it's shiny and this is all we gott

53
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,799
gud v's we knew as well you do things

54
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">like check your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> battery status in your</font>

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,710
range and invasive is hooked into the

56
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,210
car systems and gives you access to some

57
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,399
of the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> features in there and</font>

58
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,860
certain pieces of information there was

59
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,970
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly functional</font>

60
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,130
it is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just IOT fluffiness this</font>

61
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,810
video mouse is 2011 the the API that

62
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,540
sits behind this particular application

63
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,740
is an XML API<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

64
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,350
actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nissan source of</font>

65
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,820
development is this of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

66
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,269
always goes really well as I'm sure

67
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,560
everybody here knows and as a result of

68
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,940
kind of all of the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopters</font>

69
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,680
picking up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vinnie's and being</font>

70
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,270
interested in Lystra cars there's

71
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,610
actually a lot of work done documenting

72
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,870
the API behind me so I think I'll start

73
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take some time looking at this</font>

74
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,180
there's actually already a lot of stuff

75
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,560
out there as well and so the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

76
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,970
is basically forward reverse you can

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,950
literally go to get up and download like

78
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,480
an entire mapping of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> API with</font>

79
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,399
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single possible parameter and</font>

80
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,700
thing that you can do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the</font>

81
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,959
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> API wasn't really well documents it</font>

82
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,839
and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I could tell the</font>

83
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,700
colleagues API was actually secure as

84
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,560
far as I can tell there was only one

85
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,839
instant I found that the application was

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,500
talking about HTTP nice um perhaps I

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,360
doubt it was all pretty secure but it

88
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,430
was outsourced it was terrible it was

89
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">hugely unreliable and as a result</font>

90
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:20,060
nacelle took a lot of flack for that and

91
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,410
lady oops<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry forgot</font>

92
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,600
your hose on that this is why you don't

93
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,340
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> slides employees are guys so with</font>

94
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,900
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cullings avionic you have the</font>

95
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,000
application on your smartphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

96
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,970
or iOS and that communicates with the

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,370
vehicle by a proxy at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nissan you don't</font>

98
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get direct comes to the car and</font>

99
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a bit</font>

100
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">missed about initially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i started</font>

101
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,760
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> research was I was kind of hoping</font>

102
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">I could go directly at the vehicle which</font>

103
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,820
would have given me a little bit more

104
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,739
flexibility than we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had for everything</font>

105
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually proxy violate some all the</font>

106
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:51,440
console secured guy look good Nissan

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,239
interesting we then send an SMS to the

108
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,650
vehicle to come wait the car up and I

109
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,030
know this because if you dismantle the

110
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,070
dashboard and take a whole much a lot

111
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,420
behind the dashboard got the tcu which

112
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,280
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tarmacs communications unit</font>

113
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,559
there's a sim card in there and if you

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,760
pop a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim card into a phone it registers</font>

115
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,850
to the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and an international</font>

116
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,578
number if you can do any action on the

117
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,190
application the sim card receives an SMS

118
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,989
the phone that is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> inglis an SMS so I</font>

119
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,510
thought awesome this is great I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

120
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,030
get the mobile phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> number for this</font>

121
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,740
cars and then text commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the car</font>

122
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,929
and cameras<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fastest and the middle</font>

123
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,150
period who the territory reliable didn't

124
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,820
work unfortunately if you trigger any of

125
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,560
the actions in the application yes ms<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

126
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,480
the car gets is actually generic<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

127
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,610
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a wake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up command so all</font>

128
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,550
that we can assume at this point is the

129
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait up possibly the data modem inside</font>

130
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,820
the car it makes a connection back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

131
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,219
then pull some kind of command back

132
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,730
lanisa<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's unfortunately generic SMS</font>

133
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,380
wasn't something that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use but</font>

134
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,730
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a min</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago because the</font>

135
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,409
application was so terrible the

136
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,840
sovereign<font color="#CCCCCC"> libel and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one took so</font>

137
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,990
much flak because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alpine middle here</font>

138
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,250
kept not working they built a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> app</font>

139
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,720
called nissanconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> EV and it was</font>

140
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,520
basically exactly the same it's going

141
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,260
exactly the same function except it was

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,120
a brand new application and they moved

143
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,680
over to using a json api so they rebuilt

144
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,490
the apt I think we've got the API behind

145
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,470
it to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more reliable it</font>

146
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,030
was released in December 2015 most of

147
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,680
the activity app store literally in the

148
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,109
first days of this year so it's only

149
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">been around since January as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> result it</font>

150
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,120
had very<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited exposure which not have</font>

151
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,250
the kind was four or five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,140
apply you know kind of the EV community

153
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,490
they tend to be early adopters people

154
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are into technology so they get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

155
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of shooting in meetings but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

156
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:42,220
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the new API the nissanconnect</font>

157
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:44,890
EV airguns definitely not secure so this

158
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now how the newness and connect in V</font>

159
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,460
app<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks with the API so I thought you</font>

160
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,760
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay though I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still pretty new</font>

161
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,560
API kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar model to before</font>

162
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,300
but it actually wasn't so the absolute

163
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to https but they actually now</font>

164
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,170
talks in api hosted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party so</font>

165
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,450
again we only be awesome there by

166
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,830
hosting nothing can go wrong now he is

167
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,360
the company that make the entertainment

168
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,130
system like the nav from the head unit

169
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,900
and everything in the car so then

170
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,150
actually hosting the api business and

171
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,739
application talks to the really

172
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,409
interesting part then is that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

173
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,980
hook into the existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Parling system</font>

174
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:21,850
which then just send a message just dial

175
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,160
back so it's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same thing i</font>

176
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,780
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comms between loving this on</font>

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">our secure unfortunately i'd have to be</font>

178
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,568
like at a high speed to kind of see

179
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">those combs</font>

180
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:33,909
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know exactly what's going on</font>

181
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,899
there but there is some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of link</font>

182
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,369
between the van they which they just

183
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">hook into the carving system and it does</font>

184
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:39,459
exactly the same thing as before it is

185
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,199
slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> more reliable now because now</font>

186
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can keep their API up and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

187
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,800
because everybody ate a lot blowed up

188
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,169
Nissan but they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love by keep</font>

189
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,039
that going with more reliability now so

190
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,529
they've literally just added another

191
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,568
wink into the chain so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

192
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:54,729
kind of where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem starts and if</font>

193
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into these communications</font>

194
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,300
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes we want to start seeing</font>

195
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,619
what these messages and commands are

196
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,270
being sent backwards and forwards are we

197
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,619
need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of one of</font>

198
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,289
these communication channels to start

00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:07,300
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> subtly going on and the easiest</font>

200
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">one for us to get in the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

201
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,139
long between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and the na'vi</font>

202
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">api because we control the device we</font>

203
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,969
control the phone so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can do things</font>

204
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:17,649
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> installing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a certificate on their</font>

206
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,580
intercept the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

207
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,409
what I did so if you ever want to become

208
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,019
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit to NSA to your own device</font>

209
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,969
you can get your phone I use a program

210
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29,529
called fiddler there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple more you</font>

211
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:32,709
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> verbs app things like about any</font>

212
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:34,509
kind of HTTP intercepting prophecy sit

213
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,830
up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> middle and you can watch the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Congress going backwards and forwards</font>

saw the NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> size you'll recognize this</font>

217
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,369
part so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically exactly what</font>

218
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:46,659
the NSA did on the global scale except

219
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:48,099
you're literally just doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

220
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,419
phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this things about two minutes</font>

221
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">to set up so you can actually just</font>

222
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,789
decrypt the entire communications coming

223
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,829
in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your device so we started</font>

224
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,869
mapping our API i sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle and</font>

225
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:00,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will start from the beginning so we</font>

226
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,930
actually start looking at the requests

227
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,879
and the commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that get sent from the</font>

228
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">device now and the first one that goes</font>

229
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,479
out is the authentication press your

230
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:11,139
open the app first thing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice wall is</font>

231
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,878
a username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

232
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,559
actual raw requesting us and as a couple

233
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things turd that we're pointing out</font>

234
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:19,839
here first of all is it is a get request

235
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:21,008
so it get request is basically I mean

236
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,050
this is basically just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interests</font>

237
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would type in the URL bar of your</font>

238
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,169
browser so you can literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> just copy</font>

239
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,459
that whole thing this is actually one

240
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,589
longer dress I've broken it onto

241
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:31,029
multiple lines to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it easy three or</font>

242
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,708
<font color="#CCCCCC">even later lose copy that and paste into</font>

243
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,719
your browser this is the kind of request

244
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,638
of the applications making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

245
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,500
coach request so there's no payload data

246
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,630
and there's also nothing

247
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,979
any significance being sent in the HTTP

248
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,689
request headers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just send</font>

this from anywhere this is literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

250
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,400
only data that the app is sending so you

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,110
can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address in the end like that</font>

276
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,310
and the password so we find this get

277
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,250
requests that the API this is the other

278
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,530
day to the descent and we got our JSON

279
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,270
payload back from the API now a truth is

280

found this is a huge massive response

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,459
which is just a user ID we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

285
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,400
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oneida</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far as we can tell just</font>

286
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,630
a unique identifier for each customer we

287
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,110
had an array of information about

288
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,610
vehicle and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crucial ones that they</font>

289
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,470
were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for at things like the</font>

290
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,850
authentication or session ID token so

291
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,220
something that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> then going to use</font>

292
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,250
to persist our authenticated estate on

293
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,480
the investors<font color="#E5E5E5"> request against the API so</font>

294
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,730
everything looks great<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's always funny</font>

295
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,040
it all looks perfectly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know given</font>

296
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,560
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may expect so the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

297
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,089
was to issue a climate control on

298
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">request in the cast aside route cable</font>

299
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,910
logged in now we're authenticated

300
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,189
basically a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell it to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

301
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the air conditioning so again we're</font>

302
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,730
hitting exactly the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and</font>

303
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,730
folders except this time the endpoints

304
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,500
cold AC remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests we've got the</font>

305
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,360
region code of language again the DCM<font color="#CCCCCC"> IE</font>

306
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we didn't know what was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VIN</font>

307
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,960

308
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,069
then we've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user ID in the car</font>

309
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,959
time now this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cap request there's</font>

310
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,110
no post payload and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing of</font>

311
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,750
any significance in

312
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,540
request headers just think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

313
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,600
we send this request against the API we

314
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,750
get a response back those comes like so

315
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,060
today is 200 everything right okay so

316
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,050
that didn't look like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should</font>

317
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,279
have actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked well this is a</font>

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,329
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> log this isn't also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

319
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,310
anything with not manipulating anything

320
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,500
this is actually straight traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dom</font>

321
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:17,029
from fiddler so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a closer look</font>

322
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,350
at that request so we've got the region

323
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,640
code we know there's only four we can

324
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,320
probably piece that together the

325
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">language pretty obvious if my cars in</font>

326

328
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,450
which top comments on because we didn't

329
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,430
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was or how to get it the</font>

330
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">VIN number and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said I can</font>

331
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,279
literally walk with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your car and read</font>

332
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">our green screen there's all the ways of</font>

333
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:39,290
finding doodles online and VIN numbers

334
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,269
as well the prefix is / manufacturer so

335
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,860
like Nissan has their own prefect and

336
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:44,060
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last eight digits of which were</font>

337
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a serial number off the production</font>

338
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,810
line so it's like 12 so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

339
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:49,790
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was built by nissan you can</font>

340
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,319
count from one to a million you can

341
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,620
enumerate all possible VIN numbers

342
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,870
anyway so it's not really kind of that

343
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,149
important the time zone again because

344
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason you're a Paris is it was</font>

345
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:03,140
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> set to us again we can get this</font>

346
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,000
we could enumerate potential values but

347
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we go to stock on the user ID the</font>

348
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,110
car type was always empty so you're just

349
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,269
completely smell bad so to actually

350
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,089
forge<font color="#E5E5E5"> this request to build this request</font>

351
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:16,279
we needed user ID and whatever the DC

352
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:19,519
MIT was we could either get specific pin

353
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:23,269
from a car or just guess them all so the

354
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:27,890
problem values were that DCM ID and the

355
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:28,970
user ID now is FC in here anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

356
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,130
pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could get me someone's</font>

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,899
user ID these<font color="#CCCCCC"> one easier actually a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">name or an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email address I'm pretty sure</font>

359
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,290
something about yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> in socially</font>

360
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,779
engineered a username you potentially

361
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,040
register on a forum I know certain

362
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,899
people use the same user names across

363
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,939
many services we all do you know it's

364
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,380
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret they do the American</font>

365
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,970
customers are you ti<font color="#E5E5E5"> DS actually just</font>

366
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,920
your email address so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can have an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">American car or any other region it's</font>

368
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually just a person's email address</font>

369
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,940
so we can say that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could get user ID</font>

370
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:57,500
potentially fairly easily but the DCM<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

371
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,470
use there were problems a nine-digit

372
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,410
number which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large amount of</font>

request to send against a guy probably

p<font color="#E5E5E5"> / so we would suck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this might be</font>

375
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,449
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need this is only need to issue</font>

376
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,699
the request<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need these two pieces</font>

377
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:11,050
of information dude NFC or Jessa's got

378
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,089
some chocolates you can get using them

379
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,810
out you quite easily but we would still

380
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:17,980
stuck in the DCM ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> singing man you know</font>

381
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,329
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to figure out what this value is</font>

382
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">but did some research it turns out the</font>

383
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:22,989
digital communications modem ID it's

384
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,029
like some cereal maker component in the

385
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,209
car we trying to find ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

386
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:29,769
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> number any other way and it turns</font>

387
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">out no you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't and i was a bit bummed</font>

388
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,600
because this is the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit this is all</font>

389
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,879
we needed so I just thought screw it why

390
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,879
does if I just delete it shrink the

391
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,170
requested on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air conditioning in my</font>

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,180
car is parked outside on the drive does

393
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,040
like oh my god spent all my son in China

394
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,989
final values for this post nerds get

<font color="#CCCCCC">requests against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the air guy any Chinese</font>

397
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,310

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">first also good impression is a guy</font>

399
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,979
anyway so we got the same status message

400
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,170
back but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something really</font>

401
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,209
interesting in that response<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got back</font>

402
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,620
from the API what was what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the</font>

403
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,758
two parameters I dropped out a request

404
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:18,250
the vcm ID user ID and the API<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

405
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,449
just giving your eyes on fire in the

406
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,009
request to turn on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air conditioning</font>

407
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,750
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle so not only do I now</font>

408
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:24,639
have control of functions inside the car

409
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,800
it's just lead to potentially useful

410
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,709
piece of information back to me in the

411
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,180
response as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i can now put the</font>

412
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,439
user ID back in the rest of event if i

413
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,109
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but it doesn't really matter</font>

414
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:37,029
anyway so we kind of sign here now I was

415
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,920
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know we pretty much know</font>

416
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,509
that the a guy is a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> dog and we can</font>

417
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and enumerate the rest</font>

418
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:43,899
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the endpoints that control all of us</font>

419
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,319
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of specific</font>

420
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:49,720
features in the car and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like</font>

421
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:52,089
Raggedy so we dropped our two of the

422
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,490
variables in the press that do we

423
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:57,009
actually mean so I'm going to save some

424
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,779
bites on the wire so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one</font>

425
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,790
which does the API care what language my

426
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:02,079
applications in and what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the times</font>

427
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">up again does it really care where I am</font>

428
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,709
or what the time zone is and this car

429
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,089
type thing is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> empty anyway so why</font>

430
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:11,069
don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just drop those</font>

431
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,069
because even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tan Phi about the API</font>

432
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,050
so this again is the point now where we

433
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,459
already got control we can just

434
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,050
literally doing it the walls to see how

435
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,758
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shrink and that was as</font>

436
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,258
small as we could go and I think the

437
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,689
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that it needs a region code</font>

438
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:27,279
is as far as i understand from someone

439
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,110
official sources is that they do some

440
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,819
internal routing on power they send smss

441
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,980
to the vehicles so they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

442
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:34,360
know which continent to send me SMS

443
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">requesting so that's the only reason</font>

444
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,519
that's actually kind of required on that

445
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,170
request so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we found all</font>

446
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,790
this out<font color="#CCCCCC"> troy was really excited and he</font>

447
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,259
was sat in<font color="#E5E5E5"> australia and looked exactly</font>

448
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,969
like that this is the point at which we

449
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">did like this youtube video you may seen</font>

450
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,329
on the news it got so played quite

451
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:53,620
widely so we did a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube video</font>

452
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:55,989
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was basically exciting my freezing</font>

453
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,399
cold like raining car in England Troy

454
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,740
was on is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know beautiful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beach</font>

455
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,180
housing the use turning on the heating

456
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,800
for me of my cars are having this guy's

457
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,870
fault so this point you can literally

458
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,660
control all of the functions of the

459
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">absence control in my car remotely but</font>

460
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,809
without knowing anything about who I am

461
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:13,559
or where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am if you can either guess</font>

462
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:16,779
the vin or just get the vin of my car

463
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,490
then you can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just make sure</font>

464
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:20,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we you know this was definitely all</font>

465
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,870
correct and kosher we wanted to find a

466
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,519
vehicle that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> touch before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

467
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,040
didn't have prior access to so thanks

468
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,499
very much to Joe over there he dedicated

469
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,089
his car to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> research and gave me his</font>

470
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:32,860
binden Burton permission to attempt this

471
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,569
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found a to this you know never</font>

472
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,279
touch the car never been so it got a

473
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:38,160
victim of a random vehicle i would say

474
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:40,360
ethical we have consent from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> owner</font>

475
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,009
and we proved it we could do is we could

476
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,600
sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Joe's car drops out the</font>

477
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">office I remember the days outside the</font>

478
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">office was like girls I don't have a</font>

479
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,110
look in them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure the heating</font>

480
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:49,360
guy on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your car should be nice and warm</font>

481
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,709
when you get back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so this point we</font>

482
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,559
had full control of all of the features

483
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,638
in the application and at this point

484
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,499
we'd already started going through the

485
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,949
responsible disclosure process with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

486
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">son but I was like what more can we do</font>

487
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,679
like what else is in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can turn</font>

488
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,109
the heating on and off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

489
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like charging but one of the</font>

490
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,379
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the telematics system does</font>

491
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,448
in the car is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can kind of go</font>

492
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:15,190
load like a little graph of all the

493
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">history of your driving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem say</font>

494
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,180
really matter by joining today this

495
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,099
month how you know what's my economy

496
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,940
what like over the last month or

497
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:26,050
whatever you know so it likes all of the

498
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,030
journeys and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the trick later and</font>

499
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,230
things like that in your car and when

500
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,450
you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and load the crack inside the</font>

501
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,810
app if it's an API endpoint called price

502
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,160
simulator detail info request again this

503
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,330
was a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge request I've already cut</font>

504
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,950
this down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> got rid of all the pump</font>

505
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,020
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again you just need to reading</font>

506
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,880
coconv in and then this time the month

507
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you want the data about that</font>

508
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular vehicle for you have to</font>

509
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,520
remember at this point we are not

510
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,990
authenticated from<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other beyond a</font>

511
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,020
piece of information I'm giving to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

512
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,130
API is the vein member which is publicly

513
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,710
available can see through your

514
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,580
windscreen I can just enumerate it and

515
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:02,740
with this request I then<font color="#CCCCCC"> get back a JSON</font>

516
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,510
payload that literally contains every

517
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,490
single journey that you have done in

518
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,650
your car for the month that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I requested</font>

519
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,110
it for so i can literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> see every</font>

520
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,390
single time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've been anywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

521
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,979
car I've train is leaving geographical

522
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:21,880
information or just churning distance

523
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:23,590
just journey for this one cool so I was

524
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">like oh this is all so I pulled mine</font>

525
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,760
down and I like 300 needs of different

526
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,199
entries it's got unique trip ID of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a day</font>

527
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,660
electric mileage is actually your

528
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,880
economy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got 2.6 miles per kilowatt</font>

529
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,680
hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> power travel distances in yards so</font>

530
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,720
this was a one mile journey and then you

531
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,000
have a TV i think times for the journey

532
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,460
itself and i was like right okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

533
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,480
this is kind of super handy because

534
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,580
although i didn't actually contain the

535
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">GPS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coordinates I was like you know I</font>

536
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,220
can still build up a profile of like

537
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,570
when you leave the house when you're

538
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,610
back at a house when you give lots of

539
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,990
driving it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting into the</font>

540
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,969
realm of like way too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

541
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,950
to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about someone but we were</font>

542
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,770
missing like a really crucial GPS

543
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,940
coordinates so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

544
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,650
pretty big daily I wouldn't like

545
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,840
somebody to have ritually it's like this

546
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,730
level of accuracy of my travel like I

547
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,970
think I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just such avoiding their</font>

548
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,820
website but<font color="#E5E5E5"> during our disclosure</font>

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,560
process too nice a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> are truly a</font>

550
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,659
press statement saying hey super awesome

551
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,820
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> releasing a new update release</font>

552
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,340
and connect EV application that will

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,230
allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gps location your Vic or in</font>

real time anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the planet</font>

555
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,070
so this is literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can now do</font>

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,600
with the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API you can</font>

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going through like the disclosure</font>

566
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,320
process and I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

567
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,550
already pushing out an update to the

568
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,870
apps i was kind of hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

569
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">update to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app store is to fix our</font>

570
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,459
disclosure but it wasn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font>

571
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,440
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced more boss and the only</font>

572
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,750
problem with this is that when you can

573
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,660
actually enumerate remembers and get the

574
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:15,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">GPS location for each pin number you can</font>

575
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:17,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">then do that now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course this is a</font>

576
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,610
mock-up I wouldn't actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

577
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,400
because that would be highly unethical

578
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:25,270
so this is of course a mock-up<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

579
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,950
GPS they definitely would not have

580
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,690
generated more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS pigeon I</font>

581
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,860
actually had one of the world but it was

582
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,750
completely meaningless because there's

583
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,669
so many pins you can't actually see what

584
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,620
these just pins it's like you can't see

585
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,880
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the UK is there but this is</font>

586
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically what you could do with the API</font>

587
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,570
now this level this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just the</font>

588
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,830
numerator VIN numbers we're at the top

589
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,320
level here you can numerate through<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

590
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">all find the location of every vehicle</font>

591
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,770
it's not like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of too personal or</font>

592
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,540
specific but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could just go and</font>

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">more pass like your car get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vin</font>

594

595
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,600
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're Carly's now being used as</font>

596
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,580
a tool to literally track your location

597
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,290
in real time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cool of course</font>

598
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,030
like it's part of the responsible

599
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,409
disclosure process we went through all

600
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this we proved it we got all the data</font>

601
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,280
responsible thing to do is to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ico</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nissan have been naughty they need</font>

603
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,330
to be reported to the ICO for the

604
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,010
various preaches so I notified the ICO

605
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,419
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides are a little bit new</font>

606
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,980
because they only got back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me last</font>

607
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,480
week it's like they knew I was going to

608
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,940
steal guns talked about this and sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

609
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,820
a formal response that I could quote so

610
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">send all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the information over to the ICO</font>

611
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,909
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got an email back from them the</font>

612
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,129
ICO by the way you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who they</font>

613
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,050
are so I very office responsible the

614
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,550
enforcement of data protection act and

615
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,139
also responsible for freedom of

616
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,740
information today responsible for

617
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforce</font>

619
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:46,240
that might reach it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got response</font>

620
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,729
from them this other<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at whilst</font>

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,230
they divide n suffice or vulnerability

622
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,150
in the nissanconnect EV smart

623
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,059
application this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not provide</font>

624
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,110
access through personal information

625
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,510
unless the individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> has prior</font>

626
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,760
knowledge of the car owner now I

627
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,220
somewhat disagree with that because I

628
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,660
consider my<font color="#CCCCCC"> live real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS location</font>

629
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,940
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be quiet person or whether or not you</font>

630
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,530
know who I am again it could be targeted

631
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,240
someone could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got my pin number of</font>

632
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,580
my part of it could just be tracking me

633
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,410
as part of you know every single vehicle

634
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,020
on the world in the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has their</font>

635
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,150
system on it so I kind of disagree in

636
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,620
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection act again not why I</font>

for the data protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> exercise that</font>

any information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you that could be</font>

personally and as either something that

should make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal information even</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">though they didn't leak my name for the</font>

further<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the same email in light of</font>

648
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,300
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've decided that it's unlikely</font>

649
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,920
that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> son has complied</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

650
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,240
requirements at the DPA this is because

651
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's failed to keep personal</font>

652
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,720
information secure so in the same email

653
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,979
they've told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

654
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,590
that they leaked was not personal

655
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,910
information but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> failed to meet the</font>

656
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,409
requirements of the DJ<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

657
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,670
didn't keep personal information secure

658
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,010
so they've literally contradicted

659
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,450
themselves in the same email and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

660
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like okay well this you know</font>

661
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,140
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into my direction that</font>

662
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">all this on the failed to compile the</font>

663
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,890
deep end all right we might actually get

664
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,840
some action if any of you does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICO</font>

665
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,840
before you Herbert navigating options

666
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I was like oh great you know is</font>

667
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,460
he going really well we went on about

668
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,350
how they you know the listen that and

669
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,240
they didn't feel that they've met their

670
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,830
obligations a legal obligation under the

671
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,390
data protection act so you're reading

672
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,370
through an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's going okay</font>

673
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,290
you think you're about to to get the

674
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,939
outcome that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want why is the word</font>

675
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to appear next in</font>

676
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:39,020
that email

677
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:40,130
I was like really so I get like three

678
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,600
quarters of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way down these emails</font>

679
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,160
like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going really well the</font>

680
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">next paragraph literally start with</font>

681
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,110
however however in light of the steps

682
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,490
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time have taken to update this</font>

683
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,409
service and the additional security they

684
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,110
put in place no further<font color="#E5E5E5"> action is</font>

685
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,510
required at this time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

686
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,340
basically kind of do whatever you want

687
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,990
and have really sloppy API and with most

688
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">of sensitive information about people</font>

689
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,410
but as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you pass him and some</font>

690
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,930
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher finds it whenever</font>

691
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,450
that may be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICO basically don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

692
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,680
to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get involved ah no as a</font>

693
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,910
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this finding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basis it came back</font>

694
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,920
to me last week I was hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

695
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:18,200
success story to tell it still calm but

696
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,880
no unfortunately it's you know we say

697
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,620
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> put additional security in place</font>

698
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,060
they didn't they just check to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

699
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,459
authentication token that they sent back

700
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,139
so it's not really additional security

701
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,380
he's just secured they put security in

702
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,580
place because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no matter before</font>

703
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,490
so as I say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really disappointing</font>

704
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,100
about this I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the success story</font>

705
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,390
but we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get one and there's some</font>

706
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,310
really interesting key points in here as

707
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">well the lie GPS tracking for me was the</font>

708
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:45,110
biggest thing it was literally you know

709
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,700
that's like super<font color="#CCCCCC"> stalker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy we don't</font>

want people like she gets on getting our

711
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,260
vehicles the other interesting one is

712
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,530
that I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually void warranty for</font>

713
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:59,360
your car with this exploit and this

714
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:01,870
works because the color has a ginormous

724

<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't morning you a full battery</font>

745
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,159

<font color="#E5E5E5">Patrick at ninety-five percent it would</font>

develop this study up I brought it

online this<font color="#CCCCCC"> year which look Jen you this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the API worked and the API was actually</font>

789

like it had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability for the clients</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are maintaining an authenticated state</font>

but the API didn't expect it well the

792
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,779
application never even sent it anyway so

793
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual application was built with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the intention of the never sending the</font>

798
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,639
actually lied to you and I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're all ready for some car hacking</font>

800
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:46,979
because like really there's no actual

801
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:49,320
hacking here I have to say right we

802
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,570
didn't bypass any security it's not like

803
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,639
you know we tricked it or forged some

804
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameters or you know all the many</font>

805
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that you could do to actually</font>

806
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,459
something the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP on itself just didn't</font>

807
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,230
care you didn't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you won't want</font>

808
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,240
any didn't care you can own the car so

809
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,190
technically I don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like all</font>

810
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,110

00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,879
the design goals and feel really think

814
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,650
interesting means that the previous

815
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">version didn't have this issue so the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">still there and that's how I know that</font>

directly with carvings and cut connectv

821

out of the equation if you wanted and

822
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,669
that didn't have any of these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

can they build a brand new application

actually built it with these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues in</font>

830

really interesting fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did some</font>

without AC on Collison

847
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,640
I don't know it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not work like that</font>

848
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,290
and so of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course being responsible</font>

849
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,480
security researchers one of the first

850
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,280
things that I did when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found this and</font>

851
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,910
actually confirmed that this was a

852
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,710
genuine issue was gains<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fitness army</font>

853
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,940
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the disclosure timeline you</font>

854
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,280
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find all the details here on Troy's</font>

855
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,400
website there's also some material on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

856
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,649
blog on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 25 January we sent all the</font>

857
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,910
details try on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the details to miss</font>

858
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,530
out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an information</font>

security threat intelligence team in the

860
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">United States which sounds really super</font>

861
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:56,270
cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome and they basically they</font>

862
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,470
basically did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a lot did nothing I'd</font>

863
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:00,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">only got a real video because they can</font>

864
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,520
pull against me later you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know kind of</font>

865
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read all that but basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

866
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,780
it got to the 24th of every four weeks

867
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,220
four days later Troy published material

868
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,590
and the only reason that we published it

869
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,760
prior to patch is that like a lot of

870
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,199
research like this once you start

871
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,760
digging into things and finding things

872
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,410
like the name of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> API</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am going to</font>

873
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,870
request and we start searching on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

874
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,190
we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> these forums on you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> distant</font>

875
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,080
cause of the planning and we actually

876
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">already started to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find information</font>

877
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,379
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's being used online so that</font>

878
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,570
point once you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

879
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,160
into google<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find them it cats kind</font>

880
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,570
of already out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bag we explain this</font>

881
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,040
finish on the said look you know we're

882
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,629
already finding we can punch it into

883
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,090
google<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find stuff if we're really</font>

884
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,130
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it so at this point miss on</font>

885
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">had said you know this isn't a problem</font>

886
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll patch it but you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this this</font>

887
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't really kind of a big issue which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

888
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:47,360
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really annoying about so just to</font>

889
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,530
recap 23rd<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjourn to the 24th of Feb</font>

890
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,300
nice i didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this was an issue</font>

891
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,280
didn't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it impacted their customers</font>

892
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,530
didn't do anything left the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API online</font>

893
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,560
following accessible to anybody on the

894
00:30:54,530 --> 00:31:00,470
planet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Troy published on the 24 and then</font>

895
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,580
on the twenty-fifth Nissan suddenly felt

896
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,830
that it was a big enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue to</font>

897
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,310
disable the API and protect their

898
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,540
customers information so again if any of

899
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,490
you have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in responsible</font>

900
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,320
disclosures you'll be fairly used two

901
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,120
scenarios like this you're taking the

902
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,139
information of you to accompany and when

903
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,520
it's between you and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

904
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,560
think it's particularly problem for

905
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,240
their customers but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> musi get in</font>

906
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,919
touch with you I'm ultimate story they

907
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,300
will literally drop that API in an hour

908
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,770
so again you know I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly</font>

909
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,570
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a responsible</font>

910
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,190
that point what they they felt that you

911
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,320
see headlines were a problem for our

912
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:35,780
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning off interestingly as</font>

913
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,980
well Troy you got a lot of black online

914
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,240
for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> of honeybees and then</font>

915
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,450
couldn't turn on the heating<font color="#E5E5E5"> on cold</font>

916
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,340
winters mornings he actually has there's

917
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:44,720
actually reviewed on the google play

918
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,949
store that he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> i sent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a screenshot</font>

919
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,780
and he's actually printed it and has it

920
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">on his desk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google how</font>

921
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,780
much of a stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> security researcher</font>

922
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:54,020
needs for spoiling the abilities for him

923
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:58,010
to the ISIS cars up like it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

924
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,570
look like quite amusing review and so

925
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,760
yeah so they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down after that but</font>

926
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,800
like kind of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the last closing</font>

927
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,210
points I want to make it is for those of

928
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,190
you that would like quite keen when we

929
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,080
were going through the earlier requests

930
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,240
against the API you have noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

931
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the API endpoints are Ashley PHP so is</font>

932
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,850
like authentication code PHP is a CD

933
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">remote request HP so I was leaving with</font>

934
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:28,149
the thought that my car is actually

935
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:28,150
controlled by PHP thank you very much

936
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,020
so I'm hoping there's some questions did

937
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,549
I laughs I was hoping to be a real good

938
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,670
description I've left plenty of time for

939
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:49,940
questions yes two questions one DG u

940
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:52,130
equal UK when you to the disclosure in

941
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,750
protest and the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> question exactly</font>

942
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,630
that they fix it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know didn't</font>

943
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,820
listen up but no actually securely in

944
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,940
busy cause so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

945
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the benefit of those on the field it was</font>

946
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,970
yeah but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

947
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,620
did I involved so that UK in the

948
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,450
disclosure process the answers that is

949
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,270
no I've never actually interacted with

950
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:13,809
Sir yet and I'm not I don't know what

951
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,799
the process is and how like my

952
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:16,850
interactions with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ico make me not</font>

953
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,320
want to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other government</font>

954
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,879
organizations because it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

955
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,610
massive waste at that time<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes being</font>

956
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,840
brutally honest and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

957
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,340
can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that they're really good and</font>

958
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,530
the latch look<font color="#CCCCCC"> respond and help then the</font>

959
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,939
reason it's hardly too involved is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

960
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,379
you have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 90-day disclosure</font>

961
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,179
they'll disclose it anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can</font>

962
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">say to the vendor is out of my hands</font>

963
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,510
I'll help you<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this period</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

964
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,500
like dark ales because one of the

965
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,530
problems is always the disclosure

966
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,850
timeline in so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example say you know</font>

967
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">several publishers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it didn't get BBC</font>

968
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:47,240
headlines and this unless the API online

969
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:49,160
at which point do we you know say right

970
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,570
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line in the Sun I know sir</font>

971
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,370
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said use a nice day disclosure</font>

972
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,620
and google project zero holes if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

973
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard of that also use a group of nine</font>

974
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,770
take off and to say why we've given you

975
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,870
information about this you've got 90

976
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,010
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I could kind of move</font>

977
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,330
towards our with my responsible

978
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,250
disclosures now and say that I'm just

979
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,389
mirroring you know what the thought

980
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,309
leaders in this industry you're doing

981
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,929
and just follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it gives you some</font>

982
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:10,580
protection yeah and that's none of

983
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,810

and researchers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hard people that's the last thing that</font>

987
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,020
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but at the same time if we</font>

988
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,550
had not published this and not made it

989
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,929
public the API could still be online now

990
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,899
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer the second question yes they</font>

991
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:28,490
sound did eventually patch this I think

992
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,929
the patch update when they do you know

993
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:32,658

ago from it was like it was at least a

996
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,419
month after we made the public

997
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,989
disclosure and from some sources i know

998
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:45,850
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention they had a much bigger</font>

interested

1000

BBC headlines and then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

1001
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,799
to get the application sorted and fixed

1002
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,359
and things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it was all</font>

1003
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,190
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the disclosure once it hit the</font>

00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,810
headlines and he was their brand those

1018
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,230
it was hatched updated and I've not yet

1019

1021
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,580
I've written I've got details<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1022
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,990
published on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my research on github I've</font>

1023
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,940
got my little scripts all interact with

1024
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,799
the API what they require your user

1025
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,570
credentials I've not found a way again

1026
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,740
yet to actually interact with the API

1027
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,450
without the requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1028
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,879
credentials but he's literally just a

1029
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,980
JSON API so I just have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of PHP</font>

1030
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,420
scripts little hit the authentication

1031
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,290
and find grubka token and then I was

1032
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:55,360
doing I want because I've got the token

1033
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,370
again like the i didn't i didn't get to

1034
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,900
get requesting in the API is really

1035
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,509
interesting to see one point all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1036
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,830
parameters as a get request I'm not you

1037
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,120
know we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> help anyone has any</font>

1038
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,980
thoughts on why you do that was a get

1039
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,080
request I don't I can't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

1040
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,150
logical reason you would not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> post</font>

00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:14,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">request i'm going to send with wes</font>

1042
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:17,710
welker's around the code valid reason

1043
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,970
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so come from an API now</font>

1044
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no valid reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's get</font>

requests like that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I</font>

00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought but I'm not and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't</font>

1053
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,730
you first get one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicles you</font>

1054
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,200
have to go to the Nissan web science

00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,450
settle your account on that website

1056
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,419

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,900
they will also just email you back your

00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">passwords but yes once you've linked to</font>

is the seller of a vehicle actually

1062

deactivate that link to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your account if</font>

1063

you're going to sell that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to somebody</font>

1064
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:05,540
and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or care about this</font>

system<font color="#CCCCCC"> or don't use it or whatever then</font>

1066
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,110
yes you can then continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor</font>

1067
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,110
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go out and get one of the</font>

trifle of these are also applied at

least our guys everyone's passwords in

1071
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,720
phenix correct they do because if you go

<font color="#E5E5E5">through the password reset process they</font>

we do with cars like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

1075
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,990
also one of the things I mentioned was

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of things i have really</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with was a fact that he went</font>

through nestled<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the property when I</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> me not happy from like a hacking</font>

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective it is good in a security</font>

1082
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,000
perspective because I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have direct</font>

1083
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,250
access out of the vehicle which I would

1084
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,990
have liked<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may have seen something</font>

1085
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,670
another car hacking headline more

1086
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,290
recently by pence s partners in cameron

1087
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,730
road who did the mitsubishi outlander

1088
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,529
hack and he was actually able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disable</font>

1089
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,490
the fete<font color="#CCCCCC"> balam so you literally put</font>

1090
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,610
brick through the window and open the

1091
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,919
car and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no alarms of go off they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1092
00:37:55,610 --> 00:38:00,230
hack they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss a Miss of issues</font>

1093
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,180
right in their infinite wisdom but a

1094
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,040
Wi-Fi access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the food of the</font>

1095
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,649
car so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually Wi-Fi directly onto</font>

1096
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,660
the car I assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get</font>

1097
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,340
mobile data contracts are all their cars

1098
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,950
or something and just pop Wi-Fi AP in

1099
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,420
the food instead and so yeah like if you

1100
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,640
put anything with a radio in a car

1101
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,230
somebody's going to find a way something

1102
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,259
to user review sighs<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds like</font>

1103
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're so quickly too I'm done don't too</font>

1104
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:29,180
much into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth i can tell you</font>

1105
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:32,750
about next question

1106
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,790
you can say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dt IM that was a</font>

1107
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,380
modem so the digital communication

1108
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,450
modems ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe i've not had that</font>

1109
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,819
verify all the car is communicating with

1110
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,290
bitter I think that's literally just a

1111
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,290
serial number oh sorry so yeah in terms

1112
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,759
of how the car problems with me sound so

1113
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:48,890
we know conclusively<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the car</font>

1114
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,800
communications<font color="#CCCCCC"> Misun over the 2g network</font>

1115
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,150
and we know that because very very large

1116
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,980
carriers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the united states like</font>

1117
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,930
agency are ripping down there 2g

1118
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,059
infrastructure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have initiated a</font>

1119
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:01,040
recall of all of their cars because

1120
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">their modems r 2g</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modems and cannot</font>

1121
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,119
communicate over 3g so yeah you talk to

1122
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:09,250
anybody not even using a decent us

1146
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,329

<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a battery out so they came to do</font>

1150
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,558
a test drive is like a cup of car spot

1151
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:24,980
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> theoretically</font>

1152
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:27,080
Oh theoretically it might be possible to

1153
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,430
just brute force all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the VIN numbers</font>

1154
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:35,990
again Sarah Palin see which ones aren't

1156
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,259
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only thing that I've not</font>

1157
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:40,820
found out how to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in the</font>

1158
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,170
current state to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around the current</font>

1160
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,670
somehow take control or back then when

1161
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:50,810
you eventually this opens up by side the

1162
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:52,820
squirrels air conditioning so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1163
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">father's one of the really good things</font>

1164
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,520
about this depend on any perspectives

1165
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,840
for me is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad is that the</font>

1166
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,310
application on the control things like

1167
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,430
the charging the air-conditioning's need

1168
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:03,200
seeks fortunately equivalent models in

1169
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,270
like been rearranging things have remote

1170
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,549
unlock this off yeah so it's really

1171
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:09,020
fortunate that it wasn't yet you know it

1172
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,760
wasn't like remote lock over an all-star

1173
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,380
but in the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way whatever really cool</font>

1174
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,600
that they added<font color="#E5E5E5"> all oh I could finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1175
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:19,370
way to do that example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just have</font>

1176
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:20,810
advocated well so interestingly I I

1177
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,430
definitely didn't know about the GPS

1178
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,930
thing before nesanel said be a brute

1179
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:32,990
forcing API endpoints would be highly

1180
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:36,799
unethical so no yes when you registered

1181
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:40,549
and it got that user ID you said in the

1182
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">states it was the correct in the UK is</font>

1183
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,980
it mean that you choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> or your sign so</font>

1184
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question now is is the user ID and</font>

1185
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,310
state is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your email that you use for</font>

1186
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,110

1187
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that you choose in the UK region so</font>

1188
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:56,060
I said yeah I just tighten your username

1189
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,740
password and those of our use so first

1190

1239
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,470
I didn't go down that I mean we had

1240
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough information to prove that the API</font>

1242
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,868
to thinking to Warren / fix that you

1243
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:06,430
know anything after that point is just

1244
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">worse you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it was already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad enough</font>

00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,009
to require fixing so I didn't but I

1246
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,598
imagine that you could do these

1247
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:12,519
organizations i'm pretty sure can pull

1248
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,680
information like<font color="#CCCCCC"> masks like these</font>

you notice I guess it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no regulation</font>

1255
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,610
around this fashion which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now is</font>

regulations to stop me some from doing

1261
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,860
things like there's some other companies

1262
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:45,090
the answer there really is no like you

1263
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,380
know we're trying to apply the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dpa to</font>

1264
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,520
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I bleats personal</font>

1265
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,980
information but there's no actual

1266
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,140
technical additionally legislation that

1267
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,550
I'm aware of that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down the</font>

1268
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,319
pipeline to deal with things like this

1269
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you know the reason that I didn't do</font>

1270
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything when we told them is because</font>

1271
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,000
they didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know we made</font>

00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">them aware of us in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their left the API</font>

1273
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,230
up in its vulnerable stage for almost

1274
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,370
four and a half weeks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't until</font>

1275
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,050
they hit the BBC<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they pulled it</font>

1276
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,970
down and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point we won because it</font>

1277
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives a reputation damage but there's</font>

1278
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,560
nothing that we can use from legal

1279
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,910
perspective or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eastern force them to</font>

1280
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,630
actually meet this secure in the first

1281
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:21,270
place it's a fish with me I think

1282
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,980
regulation is a very difficult subject I

1283
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,470
know there's a couple of scheme starting

1284
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,910
now is he like cyber essentials and

1285
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,899
things like that if you know it's like a

1286
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,970
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of schemes like way you can</font>

1287
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,380
self-serve buying stuff for I mean even

1288
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we do go down this road it's going to</font>

1289
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,090
be a mess for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time while we I now</font>

1290
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,440
and I don't I can kind of see some of

1291
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,210
the benefits of regulating like even

1292
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,650
info second general white pen testing I

1293
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,000
know like we had at all because if he

1294
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:47,040
says muncher / utiful know the crest

1295
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">geyser is very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say though but</font>

1296
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,940
you know why we kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> do need you</font>

1297
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,550
know we do me something but I don't

1298
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,600
think like regulation you know so far

1299
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think that just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be more of</font>

1300
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,310
an inhibiting factor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will be</font>

1301
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,930
useful because it all rubbish I did want

1302
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,090
a lot stuff there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually two</font>

1303
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:06,180
things just forget it explains my

1304
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,440
fabulous work registry and first because

1305
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">it specifically automotives are</font>

1306
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,610
specifically guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd physical this</font>

1307
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,220
motor system these reason why I know

1308
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,470
these rare isn't working so response to

1309

automotive manufacturers on school

1320
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,370
exactly for these kind of issues though

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're as only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of diwali lines and</font>

1322
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:54,630
reasonable measures have to be taken a

00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,880
house include an equation testing the

1324
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,030
fines and clearly laid out and if it

1325
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,230
these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,280
interesting where you started<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

1328
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:07,590
with some of the issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our tree now</font>

1329
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,320
you're going into safety critical areas

1330
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,520
which is much more problematic these

1331
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,560
bills are being passed to deal with

1332
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,210
safety critical issues lots of there is

1333
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,820
legislation there is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire</font>

literally driving inside framework and

1336
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,049
this is just automotive though as well

1337
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,820
show some very so he's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> boeing</font>

1338
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,830
like ages I'm quite narrow it's been a

1339
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">great way as well I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it a result</font>

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,549
of you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> something specific like</font>

1341
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,810
they've also an evil thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys you know</font>

1342
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,770
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> natural progression as it's</font>

1343
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,200
a reaction of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's entire</font>

1344
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:39,180
certifications I mean this isn't it

1345
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,390
being tailored a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1346
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:46,200
security so you have my card automotive

1347
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:49,230
safety integrity levels and there are

1348
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:52,710
different stages it's true railways true

1349
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:55,080
for aviation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the minute I</font>

1350
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:57,210
certifications that talked a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1351
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,520
safety systems but it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

1352
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:01,590
really view safety or security critical

1353
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,990
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you and you can't have</font>

1354
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:05,880
a insecure system it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the also safety</font>

1355
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">system they're very closely tied</font>

1356
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,700
together you know it's difficult to

1357
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,000
argue it's a safe system if it's

1358
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:15,180
insecure so that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font>

1359
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,920
testing frameworks yes Amy or time

1360
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,660
dedicated to do that I don't worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAE</font>

1361
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,210
you know we you know we deal with their

1362
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,569
players and so I service nerds you gotta

1363
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:27,270
tune 6262 nothing related to safely it's

1364
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:29,010
all timing it's just the classic no

1365
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,440
one's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing it on until the</font>

1366
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,619
bill is

1367
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,310
us so two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> until we have you go in</font>

1368
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:38,109
to make some point so yes the wrong a

1369
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,310
lot is sorry there's a couple of

1370
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:49,390
measures are always so excited I've like

1371
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:56,200
a couple minutes yes I can't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:59,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">testicles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait to the car you see</font>

1374
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:02,259
I really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to do in</font>

1375
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,839
a minute is to see if I can get out of
