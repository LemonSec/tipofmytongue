6

we going to get bigger next year easy

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,820
answer no complicated sir no but we can

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,860
occurred so this room is the biggest

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,219
like theater in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university 450</font>

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,420
people that's it max the atrium out

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,350
there where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had lunch of things</font>

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Health and Safety 450 max so that's</font>

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,760
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this year obviously we</font>

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,399
spread upstairs to the second biggest

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,960
that it's 250 legislature upstairs will

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,660
fill that options in here we could

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,090
spread the food and all I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,048
sponsors up to the top floor onto the

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,520
heart space cafe but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it'd</font>

20
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,900
mess it up a bit you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it going</font>

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find food</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and stuff we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially</font>

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,619
split or we get another lecture theatre

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,570
and send you out to Norfolk<font color="#CCCCCC"> our oats one</font>

25
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,180
of the other buildings it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,649
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would actually</font>

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,780
work in practice people wouldn't enjoy

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,720
wandering off you need a lot longer to

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,229
turn around between talks as well so in

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,270
this building no other venues in

31
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sheffield well at the moment we're</font>

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,920
sponsored by Howard University them

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,680
specifically the Aces which is computing

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,470
department so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this at massively</font>

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,930
reduced costs if we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

36
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,369
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else with a playful price</font>

37
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,549
options we've got maybe the cinemas

38
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,290
which would not let us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on a Saturday</font>

39
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lyceum on the crucibles I'm going to</font>

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,140
cost an absolute fortune city hall which

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,570
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brilliant nice big venue but it's a</font>

42
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,659
stage and it's just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing gank</font>

43
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,669
wouldn't work so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have maxed out as</font>

44
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,729
far as WIC zone the biggest venue that's

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,920
practical for us in Sheffield so next

46
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,480
year it will be 450 again and that's

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,670
going to wear with stuck for now

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,170
so when we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tickets out next year</font>

49
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,849
don't know how we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do it'll</font>

50
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,458
be in batches or whatever if you want to

51
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,339
come on grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tickets this year we</font>

52
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,370

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,590
those adult tickets within she'll share

54
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,420
two hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get was permanent shy we</font>

55
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,879
finished off selling the kids tickets in

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,950
under 12 hours spent 11 hours 53 so that

57
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,510
was the demand on it for 25<font color="#E5E5E5"> per ticket</font>

58
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">eye drops on Christmas Day the first one</font>

59
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,310

60
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:46,440

63
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,540

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,510
about 500 quid for it so that's going to

the scavenger hunt and quiz later

264
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,919
scavenger hunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> went a little bit wrong</font>

265
00:12:55,849 --> 00:13:01,129
last year there was a lot of reports of

266
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,220
theft stuff being stolen<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

267
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:08,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sainsbury's animal cruelty people trying</font>

268
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,720
to kidnap pigeons etc and so so they see

269
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,429
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't break the rules that we set</font>

270
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,189
don't break the<font color="#CCCCCC"> law that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

271
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:17,449
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course trespass is</font>

272
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:23,299
allowed that's not breaking the law

273
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:24,799
that's a signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexico and form yourself</font>

274
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,209
into teams of five this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font>

275
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,949
important for the scavenger hunt because

276
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:29,899
one of the prizes that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font>

277
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:36,289
away but he wins the scavenger hunt is

278
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:38,119
five extra points for the quiz so teams

279
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:40,429
of five no more otherwise you're going

280
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:41,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose out on prizes basically and you</font>

281
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:43,339
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more points if you present the</font>

282
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:45,289
physical object rather than the digital

283
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,239
object that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will come a power in a</font>

284
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:48,649
minute and and you have to present the
