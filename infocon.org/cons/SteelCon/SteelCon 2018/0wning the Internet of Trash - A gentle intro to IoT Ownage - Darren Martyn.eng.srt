1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:20,090
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so um yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm going</font>

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a not setting fire to your</font>

3
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:29,540
router today or breaking to embedded

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:32,149
devices so I'm Jerry Martin go by<font color="#E5E5E5"> info</font>

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">toxin the twitters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pentester zyphus</font>

6
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:35,899
research and forensic student / gmit

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,390
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harlem where I spent half my</font>

8
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:44,870
time yeah or as Graham Cluley says

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,929
immoral unethical twit we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had</font>

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,328
disagreements about things in the past

11
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:52,039
so today I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a gentle</font>

12
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,379
introduction to the wonderful world of

13
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,699
breaking to embedded devices so like

14
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:59,120
stuff they probably have in your living

15
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,468
room so we all of like everyone who's

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,940
got an internet connection probably as a

17
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,640
router or switch you've probably got a

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,030
like one then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Plex box is some kind of</font>

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,850
mass or you know some little black box

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,340
which does internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> which does some kind</font>

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,830
of thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful be it</font>

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,710
like one them stupid amazon box that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

23
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,179
talk to and it tells you things or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,970
know a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> box that gives you your</font>

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,020
netflix or the little magical box which

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,390
all your<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet traffic goes through</font>

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,660
so we're going to look at the hardware

28
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and software side of it firstly hardware</font>

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,200
and then later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Softworks to kind of</font>

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,940
go hand in hand it's a gentle

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,920
introduction designed for you know if

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,509
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never played in the bed device</font>

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,130
before this will give you some ideas so

34
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,510
you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and take your fucking router</font>

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,670
a pirate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from virgin media</font>

36
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,650
which is full of remote root phones so

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,690
you can have a lot of fun and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

38
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,310
going to look at people actually

39
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,690
breaking these things in the wild and

40
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,490
what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing for post</font>

41
00:01:50,690 --> 00:02:00,170
exploitation and how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font>

42
00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:02,089
of fun with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that see ya so um yeah we're</font>

43
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,100
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about like so you've</font>

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,950
gotten bad devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and they all</font>

45
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,019
got firmware on them and stuff and

46
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,550
firmware is like the software it runs on

47
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,739
the hard work to do the magic stuff

48
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,940
which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box does and we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

49
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,340
talk about where the hell do we get the

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,499
firmware we're going to talk about how

51
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to interface with one of the various</font>

52
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:22,040
interface you can use to play with these

53
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:25,250
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you art which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,810
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> like over serial to USB type</font>

55
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,760
thing you know it's a serial interface

56
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,859
we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a debug interface in</font>

57
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the devices we're going to have a look</font>

58
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">at how to extract firm where we're going</font>

59
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,849
to do it I've got our case study and

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,840
finding a shitload of vulnerabilities

61
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,700
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about exploit</font>

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,379
development a bit and going to whinge a

63
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,390
bit about rapid seven and<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

64
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:53,689
amongst other things and that can fuck

65
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:55,700
right on yeah we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a look</font>

66
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">at a malware in the wild which pops</font>

67
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,260
these things and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

68
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,760
look at post exploitation and then we're

69
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at some future ideas of</font>

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,798
daftness and how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of</font>

71
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,599
fun and hopefully there's no more wall

72
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,970
to text after this but I can't promise

73
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,510
that because I put all my slides and /

74
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,159
temp and then a reboot of my box so to

75
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,450
rewrite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bloody things so some</font>

76
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,129
screenshots are missing here and there

77
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,689
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of more walls</font>

78
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:25,608
attacks but none that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad CF firmware I</font>

79
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:26,810
swear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to god this is exactly what</font>

80
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,099
firmware looks like you've a bunch of

81
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,199
microchips then you've a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ones</font>

82
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,839
and zeros or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

83
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:36,199
most ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> image i get but firmware</font>

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,109
is software which basically runs on

85
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,180
hardware so it's the soft which drives

86
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,590
at all so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your operating</font>

87
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,260
system in a lot above it and then you've

88
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">got firmware which is microchip level</font>

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,798
stuff so if you're not familiar with

90
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:53,239
firmware it's so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of</font>

91
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,159
hardware and then you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got stuff on it</font>

92
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,440
which does stuff like software and

93
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,540
that's your firmware it's it's hard to

94
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,540
actually conceptualize and explain if

95
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,090
you don't know what it is you can

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,739
probably you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know get the general idea</font>

97
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,819
software it runs on hardware so that's

98
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,709
firmware right so where do we get the

99
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,328
firmware for you know all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> magical</font>

100
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,339
med device were going to be breaking you

101
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,320
know they all have firmware which runs

102
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the hard when we have to go get it so</font>

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,829
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either download it from the</font>

104
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,960
internet because some vendors are great

105
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,060
they run open<font color="#CCCCCC"> download sites where you</font>

106
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,830
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull it down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a crack</font>

107
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,479
at it or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask people in the</font>

108
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet some people you know will be</font>

109
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">friendly enough to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you so</font>

110
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,659
random internet people or you can rip it

111
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,310
straight off the device

112
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:42,110
or there's other methods which I won't

113
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:44,450
talk about for legal reasons so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

114
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,100
have D links ftp server which has been

115
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,870
submitted to the archive team it's

116
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,700
magical right so you've got this d-link

117
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Iran this open ftp server with firmware</font>

118
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,960
for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single wonder advice pretty</font>

119
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,020
much and if you were on w get<font color="#CCCCCC"> dash</font>

120
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">mirror they get really upset you can get</font>

121
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,440
firmware for all the advice you can get

122
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,690
all the user manuals a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

123
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,160
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I strongly advise have a look</font>

124
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,860
because if you're looking for router 02

125
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,850
sometime later next week probably go

126
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:17,630
there you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got everything you need we</font>

127
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,520
have netgear stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> support center which</font>

128
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,320
unfortunately isn't as easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> tumor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,210
open ftp you click through a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

130
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,940
bullshit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to it but you've got</font>

131
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,380
user guides you've got firmwares you've

132
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,360
got the whole lot you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> search by</font>

133
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,430
product version and you can pull down

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,000
from there so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy to get</font>

135
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,160
at now some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other vendors aren't is nice</font>

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,920
so I throw it into the google machine

137
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,540
because you'll get results somebody

138
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,590
somewhere i'll probably dump the thing

139
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,890
out to somewhere and then it's kind of

140
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,820
where we go and do stuff so we've got

141
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,860
extracting<font color="#E5E5E5"> of device you've got the</font>

142
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,630
black box and nobody has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been friendly</font>

143
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,130
enough to provide at the vendors not

144
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,380
providing it because the vendor is being

145
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,370
a vendor so you need to go get the damn

146
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,980
thing off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device and we're gonna</font>

147
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,570
talk a bit about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> out here now</font>

148
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,860
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> get some kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of shell on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

149
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,620
device will explain a bit more into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

150
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,180
in a bit but and then you get the stuff

151
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,860
you care about which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally the</font>

152
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,960
root<font color="#E5E5E5"> filesystem off the device that's</font>

153
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,160
because most imran linux we're going to

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,659
ignore the stuff which doesn't run a

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
linux because quite frankly it couldn't

156
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,220
be bothered writing payloads for that

157
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,370
probably none the rest do you want to do

158
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,430
it either because<font color="#E5E5E5"> mass of pain and then</font>

159
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:32,570
you have a look at it so um two main

160
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:36,050
ways you can play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and so you</font>

161
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,730
are is universal asynchronous receiver /

162
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,750
transmitter which funnily enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

163
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,450
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know what that meant</font>

164
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,110
until yesterday because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just them</font>

165
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">four pins on advice that I played with</font>

166
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,590
basically a serial<font color="#CCCCCC"> port though so you</font>

167
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,570
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a seat</font>

168
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">board and that's quite frankly all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

169
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,510
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I don't care about</font>

170
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,870
specification of it because it's

171
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,360
irrelevant it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's got four pins</font>

172
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,130
sometimes you see five on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pinout we</font>

173
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">only care about three of them the rest</font>

174
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,320
can go you know we've got received

175
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmitted VC which we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

176
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,150
we've got ground so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ignore</font>

177
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,130
VC because vc has<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused me massive</font>

178
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,130
pains before with burning out chips that

179
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,330
like burning out by serial converter

180
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,060
when you smell melting silicon you've

181
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,479
done something wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

182
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:26,330
request in your life<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices so that's</font>

183
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,890
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you aren't pins look like on one</font>

184
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,140
device is taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> parity of the day so</font>

185
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,550
you've got four pins there it's actually

186
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:37,099
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-pin out header so you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

187
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,870
one two three<font color="#E5E5E5"> four the one that's</font>

188
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,390
missing I actually don't know what the

189
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,680
hell it does never bothered finding out

190
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,909
to be quite honest that when you take

191
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,700
apart your<font color="#CCCCCC"> router and you find something</font>

192
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that it's game on and sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

193
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,340
get vendors like tp-link who are really

194
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,850
fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoying because they remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

195
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,070
pins they leave you with<font color="#E5E5E5"> four little</font>

196
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,860
pads on the board which like where the

197
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,870
pins were<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the solder you</font>

198
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,150
know the holes and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically remove</font>

199
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,400
the pins and salted over the holes so

200
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,520
you end up looking at and you go right

201
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,260
we've four pins in sequence here and

202
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> D solder them which for me was</font>

203
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,380
getting solder Mary and just stopping it

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,790
repeatedly until the holes are open

205
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,590
again because as a bit hungover and I

206
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,590
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pissed off because I thought</font>

207
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that before pins and then you just stick</font>

208
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,919
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> for jumper cables sold them in place</font>

209
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:38,750
and boom you've got a serial pin out

210
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,669
that router by the way has really ticked

211
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,680
me off that particular ones a tp-link

212
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:48,110
box because I mixed up VCC and ground

213
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,469
now ground has nothing going through

214
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,290
normally ground is just ground and maybe

215
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">nidhi it I crossed over the VCC and</font>

216
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,420
ground pins and VC is 3.3 gone through

217
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,670
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my little serial to USB adapter</font>

218
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,290
didn't really expect 3.3

219
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,099
going through ground and proceeded to

220
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,540
melt don't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> check with a</font>

221
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,710
multimeter before you connect on thinks

222
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:16,219
otherwise you're gonna have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

223
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:18,890
day so to talk to you our pin to talk to

224
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,040
you our pin outs you could buy a bus

225
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:25,310
pirate 15 quid it'll interface that that

226
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,380
you want it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow and it's a</font>

227
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,449
massive pain to get too used to because

228
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,910
the documentation is absolutely rubbish

229
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,470
and it'll interface something though and

230
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,310
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out which one's a witch</font>

231
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:40,130
or you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 quid USB TTL converter of</font>

232
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,420
ebay because if you set fire to those it

233
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,480
doesn't cost as much and don't kick

234
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,160
yourself as much later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on they're less</font>

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,860
pretty but the job for what we're doing

236
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,079
today they're two quid I'd advise buying

237
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,520
ones when you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> drunk because</font>

238
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,080
that way when you fuck it up the next

239
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">day you can just go off i could have</font>

240
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,100
bought a spare<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arrived in two</font>

241
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:02,360
days which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them habits that</font>

242
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:07,160
you might get in to see ya this is the

243
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,410
red one is fried the blue ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the</font>

244
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,870
red one died did<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tp-link I've got a</font>

245
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch more dead ones that don't work</font>

246
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,000
anymore because again makes up ground

247
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,270
and VCC and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically screwed so</font>

248
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,920
don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really useful</font>

249
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it turns out they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can unlock</font>

250
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,640
samsung phones of them so but you've got

251
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,050
four pins which one goes where now

252
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,060
somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> explains it way better</font>

253
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,349
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do so I'm not really going to get</font>

254
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,780
into that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they've written this</font>

255
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,850
lengthy exhaustive blog post on it which

256
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,010
explains it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in far more detail than I</font>

257
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,930
ever could be some not so great at words

258
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,330
and stuff but when it comes to this kind

259
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,310
of thing but get a multimeter or

260
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,470
preferably an oscilloscope now am using

261
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,810
a multimeter because the oscilloscope i

262
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,550
soldered myself together last week from

263
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,050
parents get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> china cuz i didn't want</font>

264
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">to spend a load of money buying one and</font>

265
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,540
i don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it actually works so as</font>

266
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,520
using a multimeter thing is get a good

267
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,870
multimeter don't get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a five quid</font>

268
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,030
Matlin's one because otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

269
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,850
shafting yourself in the long run spend

270
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,160
the money get a decent one<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been</font>

271
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,420
using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really shit maplin one and it</font>

272
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,000
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a proper</font>

273
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,439
continuity checker so it's been

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,670
massive pain to work with I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

275
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">going I should get a good multimeter</font>

276
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,729
i'll do that tomorrow and I never have

277
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:25,310
so just get a good one to start out with

278
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:28,280
see it the ground<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin if you get now a</font>

279
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:31,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">good place to look is the ethernet</font>

280
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,020
socket in your device if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tap one of</font>

281
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,460
the things if you hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the</font>

282
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,670
ethernet socket which is the nice

283
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,110
grounded shielding thing and then if you

284
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,770
probe the ground pin you'll get a

285
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,800
continuity tester true so basically

286
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,090
ground ground shielding on various

it just stays high<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmitted goes</font>

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,660
constantly kind of high low high low and

299
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,130
you can tell that real easy with an

300
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,199
oscilloscope or if you sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

303
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,160
that it kind of fluctuates you've got

304
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,570
like it goes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 3.3 and then down it</font>

305
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,160
goes up and down because it's

306
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,740
transmitting and that's it sending

307
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,209
basically bits and as for identifying

308
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,800
the receive pin I don't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> clue</font>

309
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,560
nobody does because they all bloody

310
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,420
behave differently some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them will go</font>

311
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,650
high someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go low some of them</font>

312

will do weird shit some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

313
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,540
fluctuate some of the behave exactly

314
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,270
like VCC or TX pins because they're

315
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:53,240
weird but if you untie the RX pin it's

316
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:55,310
the one left<font color="#E5E5E5"> over so we found the pins</font>

317
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,839
now we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to interact that now the</font>

318
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,699
only thing we need to do next just find

319
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,720
out what baud rate this serial device is

320
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,720
speaking on so you could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

321
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean you could brute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force through all</font>

322
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,780
the potential baud rates or you just run

323
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,339
this wonderful script from a guy who

324
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,040
knows way more than I've ever forgotten

325
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:14,630
about cereal and stuff and that

326
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,920
automatically goes through all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the baud</font>

327
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,660
rates and it finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that's</font>

328
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,069
probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right one might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

329
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:24,050
wrong one usually the right one and then

330
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,520
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minicom now a lot of</font>

331
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,560
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say to use mini come but many</font>

332
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,360
commas are massive

333
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,979
pain because it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> dropped sessions</font>

334
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,630
and generally acts like a massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> eros</font>

335
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,400
so instead you use the built-in screen

336
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,590
thing which if you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux you'd be</font>

337
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,840
familiar with screen it's where my<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOC</font>

338
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,090
sessions live and just do screen dev

TTYL use be 0 and then the baud rate or

340
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,080
whatever your serial interface is my

341

case<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is going to be dev TTYL us be 0</font>

342

and then you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got whatever the hell</font>

343
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,140
the router wants to talk to you over

344
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,790
serial about you've got an interface

345
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,620
with it and here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it's a router</font>

manufacturer by billion that a co-worker

347
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,680
made the mistake leaving on my desk it's

no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer one piece that's it hooked up</font>

352
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,469
gives you a bootloader debug output if

353
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,290
you connect it over you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and there</font>

354
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,120
was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

you connect up you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get a straight</font>

356
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,440
you just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wonderful hash prompt</font>

357
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,120
and you go I've got rid already and then

358
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,860
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of fun sometimes get</font>

359
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,190
this really funky you boot shell and

360
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,630
sometimes in that case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get this</font>

361
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:35,560
debug output of rubbish about what

<font color="#E5E5E5">Colonel is doing at that time yeah that</font>

364
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,820
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if you view boot she'll know</font>

365
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,660
they all behave a little bit differently

366
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,610
to each other you can often<font color="#E5E5E5"> just there's</font>

367
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,290
some debug commands in there that you

368
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,360
can run and it will dump out what's

369
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,339
effectively a firmware image but it's

370
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,830
not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can just transfer</font>

371
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:59,530
over tftp so you hook up over your you

372
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:02,380
are to see your USB a serial thing and

373
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,910
you hook<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet and you'll</font>

374
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,100
often be able to just transfer the

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,980
entire root filesystem back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

376
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">over tftp or if the box just gives you a</font>

377
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,820
root shell well you've got a root shell

378
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,220
so you just copy all the files / boom

379
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,260
done so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just t ftp it across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

380
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,930
start an ftp server on / and just pull

381
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire thing down and then you've</font>

382
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">got the files you've got the file</font>

end up extracting firmware on scale I

bad patch management by a vendor see ya

396
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,400
we've we end up we started off with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

move box firmware we get the whole lot

398
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,819
from their ftp server we end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

399
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">shitload</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root shells so because I'd</font>

400
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,950
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and eight of them and</font>

401
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,770
they didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit there running</font>

402
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,990
bin walk all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I get RS I I</font>

403
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,490
just wrote a shell script that wrapped

404
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,990
around bin walk and run<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there</font>

405
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,540
you've got bin walk repeatedly

406
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,980
outputting what it finds which is a

407
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,260
crime the first file system now if you

408
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,260
run bin walk with the extract argument

409
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,580
it'll automatically extract whatever the

410
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,850
root file system is and stick it over

411
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,960
there so then you can deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it later</font>

412
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,940
strongly advise if you end up

413
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,440
downloading all of dealings ftp server

414
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,450
which I strongly advise you do if you

415
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,270
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun just run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that over</font>

416
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you'll end up with lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun for</font>

417
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,430
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably questioning your own</font>

418
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:49,489
sanity for a while but yeah so bin walk

419
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,469
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright we've got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">system let's take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> filesystem out and put</font>

421
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,010
it over here so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can play with it</font>

422
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">later on and really handy it can do a</font>

see ya next up when we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an</font>

426
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,589
absolute shit load of stuff we script on

427
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">cram FS because these were all crammed</font>

428
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,889
FS now bin walk will tell you what kind

429
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">of file system you're dealing with so</font>

430
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,959
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most horrible piece of Python</font>

431
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:17,089
code in the world it does stuff it just

432
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,030
calls the firm<font color="#E5E5E5"> ramada cut version of on</font>

433
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,010
cram FS and it just dumps out all the

434
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,940
cram FS file systems into a file called

435
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,440
law it's disgusting I do not advise

436
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,410
running this and production because it's

437
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">horrible you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not call</font>

438
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:37,550
system ever but it does the thing and it

439
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,990
dumped out rue des fesses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font>

440
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through files of</font>

441
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,010
stuff a new diffing and if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

442
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,290
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different versions</font>

443
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,180
something you difficult and you'd if the

444
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,379
differences across each version you're

445
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,850
going to find loads of bugs that have

446
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,660
been patched so you find all your one

447
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,928
day you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find your 10 years ago day</font>

448
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,379
you find

449
00:17:53,929 --> 00:18:01,159
all the fun stuff so when you find them

450
00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:03,019
vulnerabilities in these things I take a

451
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,269
fairly blind approach some people like

452
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,820
to go from guys attack neural network

453
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,669
solutions they break out<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea and they</font>

454
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,840
go right let's have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crack of this and</font>

455
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,129
it's way easier if you just kind of go

456
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,459
right where's the low-hanging fruit

457
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:18,379
because low-hanging fruit is awesome and

458
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,119
you just kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab for stuff you can</font>

459
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:21,860
just have a look you can open up in your

460
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,860
debugger in your disassembler later but

461
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,320
it's when you start off if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font>

462
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,110
of grab for things just kind of have a

463
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,970
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at most the time you find a remote</font>

464
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,908
root within about 10 minutes because

465
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:38,600
these things are really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

466
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:40,159
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no security so you have a look</font>

467
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,840
at the web interface that's with exposed

468
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:46,279
you know you have a crack of that first

469
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:50,928
now why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this look interesting have</font>

470
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:53,299
we stupidly named bug this year which we

471
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:59,119
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the bin sh links to bash in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">index dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CGI calls bash and then in the</font>

473
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,918
config we've got stuff like specify that

474
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:07,360
the user is root and that there's no

475
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,799
chroot this is normal you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

476
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,178
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these wonderful options</font>

477
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,399
and all the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> that runs in these</font>

478
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,350
things which could be secure like you

479
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,989
could run it as user nobody and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a.c</font>

480
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,730
hey true but they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

481
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,289
want to do a SI hay true we want to run

482
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,809
as root all the time and execute

483
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:25,970
commands and stuff so end up with stuff

484
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:28,820
like that which ends up with something

485
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this where you write a really awful</font>

piece of pie thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really shit at</font>

487
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:37,070
bash and I'm all right of Python to test

488
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:39,668
every single version that firmware for

489
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,928
shell shock and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thinking</font>

490
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:45,230
this isn't going to be bloody vulnerable

491
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:47,419
to shell shock you know no way surely

492
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,330
they've sorted their shit out by now<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

493
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,249
this is vendors who kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ignore pacha</font>

494
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,029
and you know they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ship</font>

495
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:58,490
vulnerable shit for years so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

496
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:00,639
script that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened when I ran</font>

it

we've got ya<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've got all them</font>

figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out by now is really bad idea so</font>

503
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,659
um the results of that it was 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

504
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:30,419
firmware images the results were all 108

running<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah they'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T HTTP running his</font>

also specified to run as root because

512
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:52,258
hey we've got a thing here which should

513
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:55,320
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> proofs app</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've told it to not</font>

514
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,999
do that so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineer somewhere has</font>

515
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,189
deliberately fucked with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default</font>

518
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,279
gone my stuff won't work unless I really

519
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:08,190
break the security model of the shit

520
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:11,609
let's ship it anyway because that's what

521
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:15,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get an embedded land and this was</font>

522
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:18,178
the end result<font color="#CCCCCC"> bling-bling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

523
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,340
remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> root everywhere so next time</font>

524
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,669
you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus and you're a</font>

525
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,799
bit bored or if the Wi-Fi is acting up

526
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:29,149
it's probably running a move box you get

527
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,529
root and a half a second I'm not

528
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:33,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">condoning that activity by the way I'm</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">just saying</font>

530
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:44,600
so um we've got root you know let's

531
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:46,550
let's look for more fun stuff so i

532
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,230
looked at the password files across all

533
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,490
the different firmware versions because

534
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,530
i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did aunt them</font>

535
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,710
different across<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one and found four</font>

536
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:56,840
unique hashes across the lot and they're

537
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,960
there somebody please crack them it's

538
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,790
been doing my not a few people one or

539
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,400
two of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are here or he'll be</font>

540
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">here later today have thrown GPUs of</font>

541
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,870
these and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I strongly suspect the</font>

542
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,000
randomly generated because nothing is

543
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,129
cracked even a single one of these so if

544
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,200
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a nice cluster bang mazing</font>

545
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,000
have a crack at them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I failed</font>

546
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,810
friends might have failed crack them

547
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,810
thrown best 64 massive word lists let it

548
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:29,210
run for a month nothing so if you can

549
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:31,010
crack those hashes tell me this is

550
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,240
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

551
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,879
to find this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you ever look at embed</font>

552
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,010
devices a lot embed device because they

553
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,630
boot up with no entropy because they're

554
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,640
real time operating system is what runs

555
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,040
them basically you're going to find the

556
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,040
vendors hired code like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> holston</font>

557
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,080
DSA keys and in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of move box</font>

558
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,389
they also like some random private key

559
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,590
with no password dumped somewhere which

560
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:56,960
was in each<font color="#E5E5E5"> c / ssh key so when you look</font>

561
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,520
at these are kind of like well the

562
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,260
device starts are no entropy so can't

563
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,139
just regenerate the keys every time of

564
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,860
boots see end up with hard coded vendor

565

specified<font color="#E5E5E5"> root keys left there which are</font>

566
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,750
never changed on reboot they could be

567
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,000
but it's a case of not enough entropy to

568
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,250
regen them because it starts off with

569
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,100
the same zero entropy tools so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

570
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,500
create predictable keys anyway so they

571
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:26,090
hired called them the rubbish but you

572
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:29,270
can use these to fingerprint so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hcs</font>

573
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,280
sage key when I scanned using<font color="#CCCCCC"> showdown</font>

574
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,980
to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look to see what box out there</font>

575
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,430
lived with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole ski I found two</font>

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,950
random boxes in Germany which you could

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:42,650
hypothetically<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in with that ssh key</font>

578
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,340
but I don't advise doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I publish</font>

579
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,059
the ssh key by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it's open github</font>

580
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,799
don't know who these box

belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their random boxes that</font>

582
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,408
there's a sh private key for for some

and you stick them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to show it on</font>

591
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,980
you'll often find that every other

592
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:19,009
device made by the same vendor as same

593

key or every other stat specific device

594
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:23,480
you'll find every instance of it in the

595
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,629
internet if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you scan for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SH using it or</font>

596
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,019
something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had was the number wait</font>

597
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:31,639
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> yea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand or so you know bucks</font>

598
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:35,899
son showed on that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where this</font>

599
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:38,299
same box is the same SSH key that you

600
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,590
could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into via various remote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

601
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,559
things one which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed in a few</font>

602
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,730
slides ago so yeah all those were

603
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,168
vulnerable you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these to</font>

604
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,210
fingerprint and you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these to</font>

605
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:49,490
identify so if you're if you find a

606
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,080
vaulting you just take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssh key if</font>

607
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,990
that box scan for it you'll find all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

608
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,009
other ones really handy way you know if

609
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,450
you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vulnerability scanner</font>

610
00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:05,350
is something one way fingerprinted this

611
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:09,080
the duplicate keys scan everywhere if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

612
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:13,490
scroll down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going it was</font>

613
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:16,639
kind terrifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> use all the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

614
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,049
they all the same key I mean sh Keys

615
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:20,869
supposed to be you know unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> per</font>

616
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,700
device you know per user but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like</font>

617
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,499
hey we've got a thousand them that are

618
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,600
exactly the same because we had code

619
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:31,009
links we couldn't be bothered doing it

620
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,840
differently so you know decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go hey</font>

621
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:35,330
let's find<font color="#E5E5E5"> SL private key by the way the</font>

622
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,299
device in question here did ssl

623
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:41,269
interception I used to have a great

624
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,980
slide with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lovely NSA diagram vest</font>

625
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:47,720
sell out and moved here but it got lost

626
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:50,299
/ temp but um yeah it all these things

627
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,749
they intercept SL they fire stuff off

628
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:55,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">over VPNs and they've got private keys</font>

629
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:56,990
and public<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys all over the shop and</font>

630
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:59,959
they're all the same across devices

631
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,860
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> md5sum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the SL case but</font>

632
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,990
you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

633
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,030
things they've got all these hard coded

634
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,340
certs and creds and stuff which are

635
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,629
reused across the world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

636
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,730
beautiful if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

637
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,760
things and if you want to intercept

638
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,620
people's traffic you just use those<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

639
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,440
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> renders all the what security</font>

640
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:21,559
provided by openvpn openssl absolutely

641
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,140
useless as fresh selkies they were

642
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:27,250
various ssl private keys located across

643
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,650
108 firmware images there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mo</font>

644
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,780
they were all in each device identical

645
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they weren't protected by any</font>

646
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:39,500
passphrase or credentials ranting just

647
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,940
said straight up private key so we found

648
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,470
out these things are vulnerable as hell

649
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:47,480
right now this where I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a</font>

650
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,600
gripe so we're right next plates for

651
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,700
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we found bugs you know</font>

652
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,740
we can go find bugs finding bugs is pits

653
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,179
easy anyone could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you could</font>

654
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,830
probably get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three year old and they'd</font>

655
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:59,929
find your remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> root in half an hour I</font>

656
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,309
mean Boop and should hire an army of

657
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:03,380
three year olds and they devolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">day in the world if they just target an</font>

659
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:09,650
embedded devices because you look at

660
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,889
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they break I mean if you want</font>

661
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find if you've got a router at home</font>

662

unplug it from the internet for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> snack</font>

663
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:18,049
before you do this and make sure it's a

664
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,190
spare one because somebody something

665
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:22,820
somewhere is going to break horribly

666
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:26,210
when you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but um if you log into</font>

667
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,100
you spin up burp you log into your

668
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,080
router through burp and this is a really

669
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,178
lazy way of finding yet another zero<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

670
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">in these things and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just run</font>

671

672
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:42,799
and you've probably got like ten

anything which is why these bugs end up

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,850
in production it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if they're</font>

00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,890
to crack oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought oh so this is</font>

987
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:07,189
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well together well the hell is</font>

989
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">just it just infected all these devices</font>

990
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,930
scattered in fact it and then they're

991
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:18,620
just disappeared it just switched off

992
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:21,549
you go two stops eating anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah</font>

993
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:24,470
but people are doing this it happens

994
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,420
your router is probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd if your</font>

995
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,040
intensity drops in one look at you know

996
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:34,070
is one of your box pocketing something

997
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,420
so what ya got post exploitation figure

998
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,250
you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is enough for their</font>

999
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,320
scripts being stricken is a pocket

1000

halftime or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> stealing your</font>

1002
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,000
post exploitation we also want to useful

1003
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,960
things not high<font color="#CCCCCC"> standing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for people</font>

1005
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,090
are really nice tactic when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes to</font>

1006

your client and personable<font color="#E5E5E5"> out because</font>

1007
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:59,810
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some embedded devices over</font>

1008
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,080
which probably forward in a pinch it

1015
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,820

1016
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,130
we need tools that put us on that box

1017
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,810
after you've got rid on right so maybe

<font color="#E5E5E5">you can just don't like leaving sniff we</font>

1026
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:45,580
twice simply because they don't tie it

1027
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:48,190
up again and then we go home but we stay

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus because these things again</font>

that because if we get a pen dog in
