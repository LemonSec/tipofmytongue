them infiltrate the gangs etc so

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,510
interesting times and it turned out that

51
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,679
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an investigation going on and</font>

52
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,660
there was some evidence being compiled

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,790
but somebody who works for customs and

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,680
excise let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say who's kind of</font>

55
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,109
broke and he was supplying some of the

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,090
information back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

57
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,100
there was supposed to be investigating

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,080
so we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of run up and in the</font>

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,450
dead of night<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any movie of his server</font>

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,070
and all those sorts of things in kind of

61
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,410
presenting presenting evidence but it

62
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,000
was through that that I caught got a bit

63
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,549
of a bug for the info<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 I'd of things</font>

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,660
are fortunate it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interesting</font>

65
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:59,280
it'll be different from desktop support

66
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,420
you know I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for a while now</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm all kind of moving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to infosec so</font>

68
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">before I kind of go on I'll just say</font>

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,450
what it doesn't contain I'm not super

71
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:19,380
a hacker tight talk but what it does

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
contain is how to kind of be an

73
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,829
effective member of an infosec team

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,890
within the kind of corporate environment

75
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,380
it's based on my experience over the

76
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:32,880
years as a contractor having seen good

sit person so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lets</font>

143
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,469
you kind of go through your<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and it's</font>

144
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually something around those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there may</font>

145
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,259
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been other kind of spikes that</font>

146
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,459
could have put in there but I thought

147
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,059
these are the ones that I've kind of

148
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:29,889
mostly seen and mostly done so if you

149
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:31,539
kind of think about that for a second i

150
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,719
mean i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if or anybody wants to</font>

151
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hannah but is there a pattern here</font>

152
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:39,669
i mean i'm i'm basing it on my

153
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:44,169
experience but you go in and you do your

154
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:46,929
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you kind of go home you're</font>

155
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:48,909
kind of not so uncommon day becomes your

156
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:51,638
business as<font color="#CCCCCC"> usual you're in your bubble</font>

157
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:58,058
so essentially it becomes routine for

158
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:59,110
you and you know when who notes the

159
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:07,749
picture in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background because</font>

160
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:10,499
anybody recognize that sorry yeah is but

161
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:14,379
do you recognize the quote if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

162
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:16,779
there you go see and people often call

163
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,459
they quote him so much you know if you

164
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,808
know your enemy and if you know your

165
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,789
environment you weren't these 100

166
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:24,819
battles and all that kind of stuff yeah

167
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:26,649
but the thing is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business world</font>

168
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,839
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the or actually you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

169
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:36,179
know your own environment let learn the

170
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:38,919
enemy so you're saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then</font>

171
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:40,438
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what do you</font>

172
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,628
do how do you actually pop your bubble

173
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:48,389
so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> part hopefully I'm going to</font>

174
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,389
kind of extrapolate a bit more

175
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:57,429
so take a typical environment you've got

176
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,880
these lovely bubbly type circles i drew

177
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,300
you've got legal and HR and finance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

178
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of departments typical ones</font>

179
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,850
there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> word in there that you have</font>

180
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,909
to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of be cognizant of your in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

181
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:16,750
bubble but guess what some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those they</font>

182
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,870
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and kind of bubble</font>

183
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,550
bubbly type problem to do with so you're

184
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,000
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only person who's going in to do</font>

185
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,760
their job to go home that's what most

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,590
people do so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec pros we need to</font>

187
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,730
be cognizant of that we can't just kind

188
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,989
of go and knock<font color="#CCCCCC"> on people's doors they</font>

189
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,240
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you should be doing x y&z</font>

190
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:39,430
because essentially they're being

191
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,919
measured on different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things they have</font>

192
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:44,290
their own targets they have their own

193
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,040
culture they have their own team

194
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:52,180
dynamics and the politics within those

195
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,130
their own measurables so one of them

196
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,780
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the messages I'd like for people</font>

197
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:00,580
to take away is that as info see people

198
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,050
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to appreciate that</font>

199
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,050
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us well in our bubbles</font>

200
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,689
other works in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some places where in the</font>

201
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,720
security team the tech guys don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

202
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:16,300
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> info sick guys if there's been</font>

203
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,770
occasions when people you know you're

204
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to be liaising with each other</font>

205
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,740
and talking to each other and kind of

206
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,329
spreading the message<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

207
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,670
why you should have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why should</font>

208
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,320
build security into things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if the</font>

209
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,640
people that are supposed to be doing

210
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,300
that can't communicate with each other

211
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,300
we've got a problem there's been a

212
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,189
couple more than one<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where I've</font>

213
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,540
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of as a contractor I've landed in</font>

214
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,000
there and I've gone to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> techie guys</font>

215
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,349
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and and I my</font>

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">work is usually in that side of things</font>

217
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,940
and it's all oh you're the first one

218
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,910
who's actually come to talk me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

219
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to us in the kind of actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

220
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,819
into the depth of things and ask

221
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,530
technical questions and kind of probe

222
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,980
certain things the other guys haven't

223
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,270
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> really why is that and so well you</font>

224
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,320
know they come along as they all would

225
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,390
do the policies we're doing the

226
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,760
awareness wedding the ISO stuffing you

227
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,290
guys always want the command

228
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,730
line etc scepter of doing all the proxy

229
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,579
stuff all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical side of things</font>

230
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,810
and have never approached us i said well

231
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,580
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you approached them and so we'll</font>

232
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">know well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's a two-way thing so you</font>

233
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,290
that the paint is that everybody's in

234
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,359
their little Bob they do their thing but

235
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,920
if there's an in an infosec<font color="#CCCCCC"> department</font>

236
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,130
and then those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two don't talk to each</font>

237
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,510
other then I think there are problems

238
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,950
because if you can't do it within the

239
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,080
info State Department how how do you

240
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,010
convince the business that you should be

241
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,010
able to security into things

242
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,339
so I thought you know what it's a hard

243
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,319
sell this talk right it's not technical

244
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,850
it's not rock star<font color="#CCCCCC"> e but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I try and</font>

245
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce a bit of a game into it so it</font>

246
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:56,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a play bit of a game oh good I was</font>

247
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:58,379
hoping for her so I found these cool

248
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,939
little icons right and they looked not

249
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,879
like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but I thought you</font>

250
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:04,560
know you could place kind of possibly

251
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:09,810
which department they might belong to

252
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,189
right so I'm getting a few lumps I'm

253
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,349
seeing some people probably recognize

254
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:15,060
potentially so i'll go into what the

255
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,149
arrows mean in a bit but just for the

256
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,040
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun sake on the top left who's</font>

257
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,779
going to kind of be bold enough to say

258
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:30,209
well where do you think she<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits in what</font>

259
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:32,759
department<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so yes she was a</font>

260
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:34,439
child<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when we're not when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

261
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">found thee when I found the life as I</font>

262
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:40,620
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like an HR person what</font>

263
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:46,500
about the dude in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle Kate let's</font>

264
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:54,689
have a look I was so surreal what about

265
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:55,889
the lady on the right well so I heard

266
00:11:54,689 --> 00:12:01,800
somebody call the right one out of a

267
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:07,980
solemn PR what about the one on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

268
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,839
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> left I was going for yeah he did</font>

269
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">mommy's new job so I thought okay well</font>

270
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:17,189
then he might well be kind of in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

271
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:20,129
category potentially well I was being a

272
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:28,319
bit more positive but yes then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dude</font>

273
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:30,629
in the middle and then well possibly but

274
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:32,459
he resonated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT for me so I'll</font>

275
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:35,209
bonding in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and then the guy the</font>

276
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,209
fun looking good

277
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,160
hey what's pilots so that was a bit of I

278
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,540
I wanted to make it light-hearted

279
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,699
because it is you know it's the

280
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,589
difficult topic to talk about when I

281
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,380
hope I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> across but they're the arrows</font>

282
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:58,200
and then the info state pro in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

283
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,140
middle is like you me whoever works in

284
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,340
department but the arrows are that

285
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,380
message I'm trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> across is you</font>

286
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,520
should be ordered<font color="#CCCCCC"> Olympus it department</font>

287
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,010
should be the one that reaches out to

288
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,569
those departments or other five put a

289
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,610
few here there are others in an

290
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,590
environment but you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be making the</font>

291
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,410
effort to say right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is what we</font>

292
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,330
do this is how we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and go and talk</font>

293
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,160
to people find out what they do on a

294
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,160
daily basis because whenever I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

295
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,719
start a new role I go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually kind</font>

296
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,569
of introduce myself I by people of

297
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,690
coffee take bags of jelly babies around

298
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:33,000
you know build that relationship at the

299
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,400
beginning with as many departments as I

300
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,930
can with their heads ideally but if

301
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,459
they're not available because usually

302
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,589
got they've got a calendar book town you

303
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,060
can't get into them but if you can

304
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually go and talk to the people say</font>

305
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,020
right what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you face on a daily basis</font>

306
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,380
what sort of issues you face you I've

307
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,090
I'm talking specifically from personal

308
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,040
experience and<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have said you know</font>

309
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,450
what you you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rare for</font>

310
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,579

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,720
that's what I think you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

315
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,510

328
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,390
a hit list because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

329
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in here right you say you fix</font>

330
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,840

331
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,040
nothing's fixed or whenever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> call you</font>

332
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,470

335
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,600
of

336
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,850
even though I didn't have a call<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix</font>

337
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,320
I went and talked to them right every

338
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,330
every other day you know just a bit of

339
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,380
kind of like chat bit of social

340
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,360
engineering if you want to call it that

341
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,660
but building the right relationship

342
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,770
right and they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> us off the</font>

343
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,270
whiteboard so it's all right and then

344
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">they started calling me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> late magic mohar</font>

345
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,270
you doing right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was always</font>

346
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
there so whenever they<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranked I picked</font>

347
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,870
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and whenever they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could if they</font>

348
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,790
saw mean the canteen they asked oh look

349
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">i know the calls not logged but would</font>

350
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,630
you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look and it's that and that's</font>

351
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,460
the same thing i brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> into investing</font>

352
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,020
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think as people who work in the</font>

353
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,620
industry we need to do that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

354
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually kind of yes our jobs are</font>

355
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,040
stressful and we have our own objectives

356
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,230
but if you're going to build the right

357
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,760
relationships you've got to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

358
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,890
I'm point in cases a lot of times when

359
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,990
people sit through meetings and they

360
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,150
don't introduce each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> they kind of</font>

361
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,990
do the right sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of communications and</font>

362
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,370
I've been into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situations where</font>

363
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and come and sat in</font>

364
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings that won't even I didn't have</font>

365
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,760
to be there but let's at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cheers</font>

366
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:02,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can come to you</font>

367
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:04,980
about this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

368
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,150
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I don't like this anymore to</font>

369
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,580
be honest I never really liked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

370
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,500
people processing technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

371
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we all know which one's</font>

372
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,850
the most important one out of those

373
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:21,660
right but it's there's only one that

374
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,660
really kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually matters and it's</font>

375
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one it's always down to the people</font>

376
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:32,370
so ways down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of building the</font>

377
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:34,770
right relationships so I looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

378
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,600
politics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at the personalities</font>

379
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,790
sorry the people process and technology

380
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,390
and I thought there's something that's

381
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">even more critical than that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

382
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:48,240
personalities politics and frost because

383
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,860
if you don't understand the kind of lay

384
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,780
of the land within your environment that

385
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,580
you're in and you don't understand the

386
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,319
kind of inter dynamics and the teams and

387
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,160
the cultural issues the rest of it

388
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,450
doesn't really matter because you're

389
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to you're not going to be able to</font>

390
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,420
fit in you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to</font>

391
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,550
say right you know what if I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so</font>

392
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,930
so about this that might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> go off if</font>

393
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,938
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a project manager about</font>

394
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,619
building security in from the beginning

395
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">or</font>

396
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:11,899
going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> techie team to talk to</font>

397
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:13,520
about a change I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build those</font>

398
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationships in the beginning I need to</font>

399
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,980
understand those three because it's

400
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:26,559
that's the key think trust if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

401
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:33,790
to build that up so as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of slowly</font>

402
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:36,740
wind down I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few takeaways so</font>

403
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,659
over the years I've seen kind of good

404
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,820
info sake and bad info second then

405
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,530
somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle and people have</font>

406
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,879
been talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brandi infoset</font>

407
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,080
department but in my head about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

408
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,610
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been talking about it</font>

409
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,460
to a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> people over the last few years</font>

410
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:55,370
because essentially you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font>

411
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,570
of get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and market yourself and</font>

412
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,610
I've always said can't become your own

413
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">little startup think of it like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

414
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:07,459
think of it like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be kind of</font>

415
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:09,110
dynamic and actually build security out

416
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,860
and give a night give a name to it

417
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,780
create content net well I say pull one

418
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,219
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> base you're always kind of sending</font>

419
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,629
things to people's her oh you should

420
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,880
come to this presentation you should

421
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,400
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of read these emails etc etc but if</font>

422
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,800
you flip it around and create engaging

423
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,020
content that's suitable for everybody

424
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,360
and has different messages for different

425
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,950
levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put it out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then if</font>

426
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,719
you branded yourself properly people

427
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,980
would come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull it and actually look</font>

428
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,150
at themselves and view it themselves

429
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,950
rather than you saying where I do this

430
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,550
do this do this this is security because

431
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,710
they've got their daily job to do to

432
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,059
bring out the personalities bit this may

433
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,660
work for some places it might not work

434
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:49,610
for others but look at the people within

435
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,710
your team and actually kind of get them

436
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,780
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet do video kind of things</font>

437
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,790
that do like little sound bites so that

438
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,428
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business knows who they are rather</font>

439
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,530
than some person in infosec nobody knows

440
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the first person that the</font>

441
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">business sees when they well as an</font>

442
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,490
infosec issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that infests it going</font>

443
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,900
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> woman and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know they</font>

444
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,800
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't know who he or she is</font>

445
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,800
and never seen them

446
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:23,250
be seen and be known what do I mean here

447
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,870
so as I surliest is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to do the</font>

451
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,970
actually kind of build those

452
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,560
relationships walkabout I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk about people for a bit not so she</font>

454

456
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:48,360
sec and it builds that and then slowly

457
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">people begin to build that respect you</font>

458
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,530
know when<font color="#CCCCCC"> management has briefings and</font>

459
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,929
they kind of stand up and they begin to

460
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,420
talk about objectives and kind of

461
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,910
successes of the last month<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font>

462

somewhere and I that used to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

465
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,790
you have a little spot in there why

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,060
don't you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get answer all right</font>

467
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,889
you know this is infosec and these

468
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,540
things happen and this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

news something that's of the now and

470
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,180
people get and share some data share

471
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,060
some info you know couple of minutes and

472
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">people said oh well we've never</font>

473
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,360
approached management to be there we we

474
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,140
you know nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the team wants to do</font>

475
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,399
it I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you're trying to kind</font>

476
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sell it to the business but you're</font>

477
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,830
not making an effort to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get up</font>

478
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do anything and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

479
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,570
got these things going the last word is

480
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,580
kind of you know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

481
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,960
going you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

482
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">a one-off thing and we've done it now</font>

483
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stopped because with everything</font>

484
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,490
in life you once you've got the ball

485
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:59,510
rolling you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going drop</font>

486
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,510
shadows so

487
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:06,969
again we've got a bursting your bubble

488
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,149
is kind of you've got to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

489
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,799
instigate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Job Shadow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff again</font>

490
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:14,080
I've seen place where they did that and

491
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">it sometimes it works it there's</font>

492
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,990
obviously places where it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

493
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,149
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more difficult to do but on</font>

494
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,740
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> people welcome it when you say</font>

495
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:22,418
hey to some come spend half a day with

496
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,760
infosec and will show what we do and how

497
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do it and then a people reciprocate</font>

498
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,809
it so you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sit with legal and</font>

499
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,700
HR and any other department within the

500
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,620
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> Taylor we'd like to see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from doing that you see</font>

502
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,918
what they go through on a daily basis

503
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,870
what their issues are and you spot

504
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,460
things you should know what there's

505
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">something coming up in one of the</font>

506
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,360
projects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might help you to do with</font>

507
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,429
is easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as secure as possible and</font>

508
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,769
it's it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be instigated by</font>

509
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,360
inpho sick team<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever leads there</font>

510
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:52,029
needs to be able to say right these are

511
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,549
the approaches that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

512
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:57,090
got to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to share information talk</font>

513
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:59,889
to the business<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how many passwords</font>

514
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,720
resets you had and how many incidents

515
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:03,399
you solved and you know build something

516
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,220
where you actually share that info

517
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:07,570
because again with two siloed we kind of

518
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,210
do the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody really about</font>

519
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,950
knows about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't kind of</font>

520
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,230
what's the word celebrate our successes

521
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,690
type thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to share the</font>

522
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,970
information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know all comes</font>

523
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,620
down to being open again we all know

524
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,649
that we've info SEC has always been

525
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,090
what's it you're a blocker you know you

526
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:27,279
always kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get in the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

527
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,600
doing things well if you're open and

528
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,010
you've you know you share information

529
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,230
and you instigate those sort of

530
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,690
relationships people begin to understand

531
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,100
you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better because you need to</font>

532
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,340
understand the business in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

533
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,168
actually sell yourself and actually

534
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,510
market yourself a brand the team and

535
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:45,250
actually become somebody who people can

536
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,990
trust and people can know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say all</font>

537
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">right well you know what I've seen so</font>

538
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,340
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks a bit dodgy I know who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

539
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,429
to report it to or something along those

540
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,720
lines so people actually you've built

541
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:59,230
that relationship you pop your bubble

542
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,110
and that's that's the kind of sort of

543
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:05,169
tape that I've taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it over the loss</font>

544
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:09,789
god I've been carrying now 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

545
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:12,850
it's actually being open so my final

546
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,310
slide who's done a bit electronics in

547
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,730
their time

548
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:20,740
you got the analog and digital so as

549
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,350
humans we're kind of analog creatures

550
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,580
are continuously variable right but

551
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,159
we're always applying kind of digital

552
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,590
solutions to things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as we</font>

553
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,090
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understand that it's all about</font>

554
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,030
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually building the right</font>

555
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:36,939
relationships we will begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

556
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward and yes technical solutions have</font>

557
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,310
their place but ultimately it's about

558
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,610
being open being doing the simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

559
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:48,190
and people begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually read things</font>

560
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,360
will resonate and will actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin to</font>

561
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:54,850
get the message out there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

562
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,010
than we have been so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think for me that</font>

563
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,320
may well be it thank you very much still

564
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">con think I'm done ya know thank you</font>

565
