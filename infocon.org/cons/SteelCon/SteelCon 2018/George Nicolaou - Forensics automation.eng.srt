1
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:18,930
so i'm here to present some software

2
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,360
that have been working for as part of a

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:27,369
different project<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm working on with</font>

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:31,720
silencing so they have to do with mobile

5
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:36,250
forensics as anyone you ee-oh by<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:40,030
forensics I so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to apologize</font>

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,600
because I mean slow at the start<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:46,780
every talk might<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a few moments to</font>

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,429
pick it up so what we're going to talk

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,949
today is so just more or less<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font>

11
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:57,039
mobile forensics or rather constraints

12
00:00:53,949 --> 00:01:01,839
that everyone has stabbed mobile

13
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,360
forensics has come across some common

14
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:07,120
grounds in different devices different

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,630
operating systems that you have when we

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,810
doing the forensics and how could we go

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:19,990
by achieving some form of automation on

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:22,270
the lease in values forensic scenarios

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,729
and operating systems we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a demo on a piece of software that</font>

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:31,150
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tries that</font>

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:34,480
tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this automation for you so</font>

23
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,570
finished yet but hopefully by the end of

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,560
this month we have an open source

25
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,759
release of that true we will also see

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:49,470
some other software I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed the</font>

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:52,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">CSM correct position software and memory</font>

28
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,750
process down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there which all of them are</font>

29
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,750
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of the final release of</font>

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:02,070
the software these ones should be

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">released by the end of this next week</font>

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,940
like so more or less mobile forensics

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,560
you doing forensics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile devices</font>

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,690
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different operating syst</font>

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,140
so basically what this organ<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clues</font>

36
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:20,280
mobile devices themselves the systems

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,099
that they've interacted with and mainly

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,520
systems that acquire the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backups for</font>

39
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:30,429
those devices communicate with those

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,519
devices and so on and any other

41
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:38,200
peripheral devices such as removable

42
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,989
storage sim cards anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:47,250
connected by so when moving east into

44
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:51,040
these talks that's really changing so

45
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,670
nowadays mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices are smartphones</font>

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,130
are full-blown operating systems the

47
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,130
same themselves they done on the area in

48
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">platform if caught the Android one is a</font>

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,569
full-blown New York system you can do

50
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,390
pretty much whatever you can do on a

51
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,929
Linux system on them the other ways

52
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:17,559
Lorelai's is a unix-like system if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

53
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:19,840
did enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> people so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're easily</font>

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,709
programmable through a number of

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,760
interfaces the frameworks that they

56
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:30,579
provide they repealed with the defense

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,700
in mind which makes it harder for you to

58
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:36,970
Luna forensic analysis they have a bunch

59
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,910
of lockdowns keys and crimson staff

60
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,850
hardware and software and<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture makes</font>

61
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,880
it a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex fire fire before</font>

62
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:54,069
anything artifacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to extract</font>

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:56,319
evidence from and so on so what I'm

64
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,000
issues with this mobile devices what

65
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,149
were the issues with mobile forensics

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,630
the biggest issue is that this world the

67
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:09,880
smartphone world constantly evolves from

68
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:13,769
one year to the next in a few the next

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,719
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

70
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:19,850
constant updates every couple of months

71
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,570
new features<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

72
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:27,240
more applications and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in this</font>

73
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,900
kind of environment of constant change

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,750
is very hard to maintain capability I

75
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the forensics the mobile</font>

76
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,960
forensics if something changes

77
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:43,830
constantly it's hard to do to know that

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,210
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed process to in forensics on</font>

79
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,820
those devices if put some clothes and

80
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,400
regulations changing some of them are

81
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,610
trying to force mobile devices to change

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,340
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things we have</font>

83
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,930
corporate driven changes for example

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,190
they've been some hiccups about the

85
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware and software and flip shoulders</font>

86
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:13,440
in provided on most devices so you have

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">different operating system different</font>

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,390
file systems in use of the devices

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,659
different applications different

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,500
peripherals and all these many things

91
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it hard for you to do the</font>

92
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,970
forensic analysis then you have the

93
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:35,310
constant updates and changes like we

94
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:37,440
said so how do you achieve animation in

95
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,630
this constantly changing environment

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you can do one thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,820
do you cannot actually help hold

98
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything so based on the current state</font>

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:52,380
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address of an Android device or</font>

102
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:05,729
information from that's most that's what

103
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:08,039
most commercial entities have been doing

104
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,100
but nowadays<font color="#CCCCCC"> in trying to change things</font>

105
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,410
and make them or generate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program at</font>

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Leeds is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that every time something</font>

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,229
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end up with a</font>

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,490
huge application more or less supports

111
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,370
or the legacy

112
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:34,259
stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard for you to keep up</font>

113
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,759
with a new stuff and so if you're doing

114
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,090
it yourself you would have to sacrifice

115
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,530
your personal life and then maybe not

116
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,229
money whenever new operating system

117
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:48,599
update comes up for a different I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

118
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:52,110
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application and so on so if you</font>

119
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,659
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the load in eating</font>

120
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,539
something framework that could support

121
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,270
these things you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the common</font>

122
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:03,568
ground between applications between

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,210
operating system existence between how

124
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:09,120
everything works or advice because to be

125
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,698
honest mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices the same thing</font>

126
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">over and over again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a few things</font>

127
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:18,599
changing on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top they all run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on an</font>

128
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:22,049
alien platform they all have some sort

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:26,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a framework which is using on open</font>

130
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:31,050
source systems like SQLite or what's an

131
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:34,259
angry anyway open source systems

132
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,320
basically they all have more or less the

applications that are built for<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:47,639
devices they use more or less a fixed

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,570
they have a fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure and we use</font>

138
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:56,630
fixed there are tips features in which

139
00:07:51,570 --> 00:08:01,469
are common between different versions

140
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:04,979
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also plan for change so you can</font>

141
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:08,880
accommodate change in this framework to

142
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:11,460
make it easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement updates so</font>

when something<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets updated but a new</font>

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:29,240
you're not the lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> level like you said</font>

that

150
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,620
were in the platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a ra on</font>

151
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x FS filesystem the</font>

152
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:47,180
newer<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions anyway the f-18 for the</font>

153
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:50,589
SD cards we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Jeff sx4 the iOS</font>

154
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:55,640
system which is the upholds proprietary

155
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:59,180
file system of course the most common

156
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:02,839
thing is the third a storage which is on

157
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,800
both devices and using SQLite databases

158
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:10,279
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one common</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

159
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">have which we can use to generalize</font>

160
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">differencing acquisition process you've</font>

161
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:19,849
got the configuration files or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

162
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:21,829
are mainly in XML mean I always more or

163
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,260
less than XML themselves just a

164
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,600
different format that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> converted</font>

165
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,240
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> excellent and then you've got the</font>

166
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,709
applications on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top that ran on java</font>

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,839
game for android and iOS objective-c

168
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:41,510
which is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> or less naming cold as</font>

169
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:46,130
well so like we said we've could be

170
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:49,180
SQLite databases both these operating

171
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:54,020
systems use a central storage unit

172
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:59,329
provide information such as SMS call

173
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:02,449
logs calendar tasks and so on if God<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

174
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:05,479
system configuration stored in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

175
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:09,680
most of their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML files and some of</font>

176
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,589
their own or key value files so we've

177
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,319
got more common denominators between

178
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:19,790
those these two operating systems that

179
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:22,010
we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we thought and when you</font>

180
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:25,969
talk about cross-platform applications

181
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:29,959
and frameworks that support these things

182
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,390
or for example Facebook a facebook

183
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,209
application or any other major

184
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:38,509
application of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices the exactly</font>

185
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:42,498
same application same way the award same

186
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:47,029
data bases so you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got more common</font>

187
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:50,959
things on these devices that you can

188
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:56,059
people so having that you might you can

189
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:58,518
build some sort of a layered system that

190
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:01,160
can do the extraction for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

191
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,110
automate the process between different

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,050
techniques that you have on different

193
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:11,959
devices and come up with there's also a

194
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:13,429
top so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example different file system</font>

195
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,628
so we can have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

196
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:19,790
understands the file system itself

197
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:22,059
device system structure so which files

198
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,559
in which folder where I can find

199
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:29,618
configuration files<font color="#CCCCCC"> or where I can find</font>

200
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:33,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> storage for the devices SMS messages</font>

201
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:35,809
the application part said that knows how

202
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,499
to go in there and extract information

203
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:42,769
from applications of an iOS and on

204
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:47,299
Android you will know that look facebook

205
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:50,179
is using this database file in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

206
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:54,290
on Android in this part of my ways to

207
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:57,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">store information for example chat</font>

208
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:00,949
messages and he has the same exact

209
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:04,759
structure the same tables same contents

210
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:07,339
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> schema of the database maybe the</font>

211
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:11,540
names might change but always the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shema</font>

212
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:14,869
remains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same configuration so this</font>

213
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the most volatile piece that you can</font>

214
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:18,500
find

215
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,229
it's completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

216
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,410
different operating systems but still

217
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,950
you can have one layer at a specific

218
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,219
point that says look if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

219
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,790
which devices which bluetooth devices

220
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,139
these devices associated with mobile

221
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,649
operating systems have that

222
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:42,290
configuration file so the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

223
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:45,260
the same I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see their devices i</font>

224
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,540
want to see Wi-Fi connected networks so

225
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is the same is justifies</font>

226
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">low interchange so if you know where to</font>

227
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,100
find the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can parse the entire</font>

228
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing into a higher level and make it</font>

229
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,579
under standard and put it in a cuddle so

230
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:03,579
the color<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the top would contain this</font>

231
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,040
information you would categorize

232
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:12,219
Information Network Information

233
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,219
application formation where else we have

234
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:19,040
configurations of the device and so on

235
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,800
based on that and based on their rules

236
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,430
yet that might specify in these

237
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,979
different layers you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come at the end</font>

238
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:30,769
after you do all the parsing or the

239
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,610
translations and yes it can build a

240
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:37,160
timeline it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> make your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life with</font>

241
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:42,019
forensic analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> or mobile devices much</font>

242
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,120
much much more easier so more or less

243
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:47,870
the system that we are building has

244
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece architecture so we have at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

245
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:55,130
moment we're accommodating<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android and</font>

246
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:59,149
iOS mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> under heat but iOS is coming</font>

247
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:03,290
up soon so we have they're not the lower

248
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:06,170
level layers that can handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file</font>

system of devices they can do the device

extraction themselves

251

can't dance of the file system they can

252
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,929
go they can dig into that<font color="#CCCCCC"> physis and in</font>

253
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,910
st. Luke this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a location where</font>

00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:30,220
applications are stored this is a

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,639
location<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the wireless</font>

256
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:36,040
configuration settings are stored you

257
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,739
also have the backup has seven

258
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,290
extractors they can pull the backups

259
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:44,170
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices and start in the</font>

260
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,860
analysis on top with slightly different

261
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:50,199
settings then on top of that you have

262
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,309
the application configuration process

263
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:56,378
the application person<font color="#E5E5E5"> purely knows how</font>

264
00:14:54,309 --> 00:15:01,299
each application works and how it can

265
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:03,670
pass it what known entries I have for

266
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,489
this specific application for example

267
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:11,738
Facebook what's up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Browser</font>

268
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:14,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Safari browser on iOS so on and the</font>

269
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:17,319
configurational person understands where

270
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:21,309
the operating system has all the

271
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:24,219
configuration settings and such and on

272
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:27,850
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that avocado the color is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

273
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:31,420
generic way of presenting information so

274
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:36,879
I have information about the device imei

275
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:39,339
or PM for example the market rest of the

276
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:42,850
Wi-Fi interface or Bluetooth interface

277
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:46,509
and so on you've got some settings of

278
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,850
the device the applications which get

279
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,639
past

280
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:56,370
the networking information that might

281
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:58,980
have and so on so how can you

282
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:02,360
accommodate change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this specific</font>

283
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,509
architecture it's simple you eat modules

284
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,000
you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> module for that application a</font>

285
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:11,130
module for a different application now

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,860
we're module for a configuration

287
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,689
settings of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android you stay on your</font>

288
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,380
version on them as well so when the

289
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:21,420
Virgin changes you know that nothing

290
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:26,279
might have changed I've got a new emoji

291
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:28,860
for that specific thing so you can

292
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:33,089
define the location of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration</font>

293
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:36,959
files you can define which<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalog that</font>

294
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:40,740
specific thing goes in you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> define</font>

295
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts to known fields for example</font>

296
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,870
have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML file that contains</font>

297
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:49,860
information I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out that</font>

298
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:55,139
device so I'm saying this XML file that

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:58,740
specific path contains in this expert in

300
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:02,160
this XML<font color="#E5E5E5"> path that information which is</font>

301
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,880
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a string which contains the</font>

302
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,990
mac address of the wireless interface or

303
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,799
it contains that why the Wi-Fi networks

304
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,799
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device was corrected then you</font>

305
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,500
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the applications same thing</font>

306
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,520
applications have<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the help files</font>

307
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:26,099
random images data files and databases

308
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:29,129
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example that the words</font>

309
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:32,820
of application has a database<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

310
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:37,440
that's called a mistaken main main not

311
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">TB which is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SQLite database</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which has</font>

312
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,850
these tables<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in that specific table</font>

313
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,490
have a field called date which I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,530
translate into<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say a unix</font>

315
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,500
timestamp because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> different and</font>

316
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:57,930
then that table as the mess

317
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:00,930
were sent from that were exchanged using

318
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,940
this application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there go</font>

319
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:07,190
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> lanius we extract that information</font>

320
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,190
and we have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a meaningful way</font>

321
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,670
right so an example of this

322
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,670
configuration files

323
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,580
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example so we've built the</font>

324
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:41,120
application in such a way that it could

325
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:44,480
accommodate custom configuration changes

326
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,250
and ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need and if</font>

327
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this example here is the core android</font>

328
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,250
browser application what the higher

329
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:56,360
level stuff too they can identify that

330
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:58,040
that specific application so they can

331
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,280
identify the location of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

332
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,889
application and from that point they go

333
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,220
into this configuration file here and

334
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,890
they say look which are the known files

335
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:15,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have and for example it's a</font>

336
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:18,830
browser to not db5 so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pass when I</font>

337
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,379
when I reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point when I pass this</font>

338
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:24,020
file what I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

339
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:28,010
this configuration and in here it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

340
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,780
have a known table called history so

341
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:35,080
there's a table<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this file called</font>

342
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:38,440
history which has a field named date

343
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,439
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

344
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,920
it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> WebKit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp which I would</font>

345
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:54,760
have to convert into a unix timestamp so

346
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:58,450
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accommodate changing stuff on</font>

347
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,060
each field and then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I'm just</font>

348
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying just telling the program that if</font>

349
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,879
you've got a point to parse this field

350
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:10,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">parsi as a date so I know that we've</font>

351
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,330
done that amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that application in</font>

352
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:16,660
that table are a field that is a date

353
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,639
field and from there we can build up and

354
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:24,900
come up with a timeline because we

355
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:29,260
already know there is a date filter so

356
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:32,650
we'll release how these things are you

357
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:37,570
can build these rules it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

358
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:41,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually but hopefully we think that</font>

359
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:45,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">with putting anything everything that we</font>

360
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,870
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make these definitions actually</font>

361
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,639
alright so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have this fizzy</font>

362
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,430
we come across an unknown application

363
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,920
still works so it's still automatically

364
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,170
processed the databases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

365
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,280
configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> files but it doesn't know</font>

366
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:08,250
that that specific field set date so if

367
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,170
you not do need timeline generation if

368
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,960
it doesn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of</font>

369
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,000
information is a day but you can extract

370
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,780
the database and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it yourself</font>

371
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,020
and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we release it we're</font>

372
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,300
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a nice right clip art from</font>

373
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it that you can say this</font>

374
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,000
is a date for example it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle</font>

375
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,000
money

376
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,729
so you can also specify SQL<font color="#CCCCCC"> pods I can</font>

377
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:49,740
get executed so you can pass the table

378
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:53,840
in a backpack for month so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

379
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,580
that for each occasion you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just write</font>

380
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,549
small pieces of information that you

381
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:03,600
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass and add them just drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

382
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:06,260
file inside the android apps folder and

383
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,260
automatically adds it in processing

384
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,260
itself

385
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:25,340
and for the configuration files for

386
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:29,690
example so we've got a configuration

387
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,668
file name wpa supplicant taught corn an

388
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:36,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">android</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device which contains</font>

391
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:45,259
this file is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice Wi-Fi and then the</font>

392
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,449
user data partition which we're not

393
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:50,440
going to get into at the moment and in

394
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,600
there what we can do we can specify

395
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,749
regular so this is this a regular

396
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">expression configuration file so you</font>

397
00:23:56,749 --> 00:24:04,279
write your rules to parse<font color="#CCCCCC"> fi in regex</font>

398
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:09,649
formula which is exact yes so what it's

399
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:12,830
saying here is that so is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> catalog</font>

402
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:21,699
have a container in there so network

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,980
so if quantify their<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will have to warn</font>

407
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,740
configuration file so when I said I had

408
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:15,110
a container is this one this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

409
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,289
so basically this thing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you've</font>

410
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,889
got many of these entries<font color="#E5E5E5"> specified the</font>

411
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:23,779

00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:51,520
or information<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is it</font>

417
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:54,160
this is the file that this emoji for

418
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,470
that specific file and here I'm saying

419
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:01,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a container in there that</font>

420
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:04,570
has specific values and I'm saying that

421
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the SSID was in divided you in there is</font>

422
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,850
the network's name then the access point

423
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:13,149
others and security time and the husband

424
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:17,080
and the pilot those things get past so I

425
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:19,900
just covina<font color="#CCCCCC"> phi inside for them despite</font>

426
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,449
and it gets parsed automatica so it

427
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,880
extracts that information information to

428
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,920
beautify and same goes for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

429
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,040
kind of files this directly so this is

harsanyi<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't completed yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e</font>

433
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:52,139

434
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:52,139

441
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,960
pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> that XML file which is basically an</font>

442
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,320
ex parte<font color="#CCCCCC"> stream which tells the</font>

443
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,740
application how to find that specific

444
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,960
entry pull the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in that</font>

445
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:54,280
entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> have for example the device</font>

446
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:57,700
hardware address and so on so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

447
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,850
the configuration files relatively easy

448
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to write so these are the modules the</font>

449
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,409
application that relatively easy to

450
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">write so you don't have to rewrite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

451
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,300
entire thing all over again so you have

452
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:14,190
to do when something new comes up you

453
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:17,620
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the virtual top and then</font>

454
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:21,240
putting the changes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

455
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,239
automatically parsing<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully</font>

456
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:33,040
now we've talked about timeline

457
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,070
generation to save you the hassle it's

458
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:39,460
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> done yet but the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on how to do</font>

459
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:42,580
it is designed it but we have to do some

460
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:46,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">more eggs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> according</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be done but</font>

461
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,449
more or less bases itself on those

462
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:52,030
modules of the modules that we write

463
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,910
configure how we pass information so

464
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:58,149
based on that we have most definitions

465
00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:00,910
you know where everything is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Baeza</font>

466
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,830
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have for example we're building a</font>

467
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:05,320
timeline so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need the date</font>

468
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:09,610
fields so paper based on you know

469
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether the date fields are and maybe so</font>

470
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,560
we have the categories of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the files</font>

471
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:18,639
probably information this bluetooth is

472
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:21,730
Wi-Fi is something else is SMS we can

473
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,700
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> up maybe in some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other version</font>

474
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:28,870
accommodate like icons and colors for

475
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:32,620
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can take all</font>

476
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,780
that information put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit hi to</font>

477
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:38,169
some analytics on top of them and come

478
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:40,720
up with something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so a</font>

479
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:45,640
timeline of events of that specific

480
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,940
mobile device this<font color="#E5E5E5"> example here for</font>

481
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,770
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put an incoming call</font>

482
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,730
contacts name duration of the court date

483
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:57,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the contacts to DB</font>

484
00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:00,640
file was modified because it maintains

485
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,400
this information in there and then you

486
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,260
have for example an incoming SMS in the

487
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:11,080
message what if occasionally SMS s5 then

488
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:14,740
access on a website so will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

489
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:19,980
timeline so we can extract what happened

490
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,980
in this scenario in this incident

491
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,470
so what we have so far

492
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:46,260
the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up something</font>

493
00:30:53,430 --> 00:31:00,120
with some things that works on this

494
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:04,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">rusted pipe and on top of these we can</font>

495
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">also put a touch screen</font>

496
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:16,590
have a nice plastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> part on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

497
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:19,049
then you can take these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh when</font>

498
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:26,428
the incident take place only two it will

499
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:30,539
be doing so basically you won't even

500
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:33,630
have to take or less the device back to

501
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:37,350
the office or in your lab you take this

502
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:41,909
you go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plug in the phone you</font>

503
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:44,908
touch something on the website i'm just

504
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:47,130
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you and extract</font>

505
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:50,970
information stored on the USB or

506
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:53,130
something and go back to the lab hook

507
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,850
this up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and then access</font>

508
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:59,399
and do the information parsing and so on

509
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:01,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it there one piece</font>

510
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:07,489
father and a half time to set it up so

511
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:07,490
all I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we show you the device or less</font>

512
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,769
anybody can have any extra things like a

513
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:21,230
sim card reader you can plug it in and

514
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:21,230
do extra extra extra information now

515
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:33,350
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> he the application at we</font>

516
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability so this application is running</font>

517
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:40,100
on tight phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a framework called</font>

518
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:43,250
cherry pie so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is is to have a</font>

519
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:47,149
last very tight running on a chain time

520
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,830
then running this application which we

521
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what we call it yet we might</font>

522
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:57,530
go for a pee so the beyond them<font color="#CCCCCC"> they be</font>

523
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:59,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a cherry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pie or listen so you</font>

524
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:04,129
can do with this itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

525
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">have does allow him to view it in</font>

526
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:12,110
smaller screens with SIA good start

527
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:14,930
framework so you can leave device

528
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:18,500
extraction the sim card extraction and

529
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:23,210
then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you can go and you can</font>

530
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:28,090
create the cases and Tommy case<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside</font>

531
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,090
walk officer

532
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:33,750
so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we do the device</font>

533
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,480
extraction we wouldn't have to do these

534
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:40,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these parts here for for this</font>

535
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:44,010
demo 1 i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do I've mounted the</font>

536
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:54,750
logical image of you uses data partition

537
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:56,400
where in stored under / mount / so we're

538
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,670
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the just the application</font>

539
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:04,620
extraction so i'm specifying to his

540
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:06,930
application look of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> users partition</font>

541
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:12,918
mounting that location in going to be an

542
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:12,918
analysis on the specific for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them Oh</font>

543
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:22,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">things starts fussing the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

544
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:30,150
what we have like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said this is from my</font>

545
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:33,030
device so right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's finished so we</font>

546
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:35,880
get you get the interface here device

547
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:39,450
info so this is your catalog more or

548
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">less I will extract that for now you</font>

549
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:44,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">just have the apps more or less working</font>

550
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,159
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment so we have the</font>

551
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:52,050
applications have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> installed the</font>

552
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:54,990
date that they were installed this is it

553
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:57,330
red because it doesn't use information

554
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:00,359
stored on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine the</font>

555
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:03,509
date it is uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> metadate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> healthy for</font>

556
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:08,190
them looks like the information but if

557
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:10,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you so basically if the</font>

558
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,780
final release which is read the

559
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,090
configuration file of the device

560
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:21,710
tell you this application was installed

561
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:24,800
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time so we go into the</font>

562
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:28,520
application what it does it lists all

563
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,540
the files and folders of the application

564
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:35,240
instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ala kulli the module a</font>

565
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:39,290
reserve our supplemental information

566
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:43,790
that we have about this application if

567
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:47,930
we click on a file it will tell we give

568
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:51,560
us signature type of the file size back

569
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:54,799
x user ID mode and so on from there you

570
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:57,890
can go on you can do it to save unify

571
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,680
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> parsi the new it do a headstand</font>

572
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:04,910
extract the strings of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vibe and so</font>

573
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:07,399
on so these are down here as well or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

574
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,950
can bother you just can't go and click

575
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,280
back and it will parse it for you so

576
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:18,009
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> click on the web view log to be</font>

each which weren't supposed to do that

578
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:34,790
you the browser to dot TV now in here we

579
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:37,850
can unit bookmarks from the device we've

580
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:44,300
got the dates down there which we could

581
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:48,200
pass we specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel create a module or</font>

582
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:52,910
ask to these applications modulus saying

583
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:56,810
that look the browser to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV table</font>

584
00:36:52,910 --> 00:37:03,160
bookmarks field created is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a timestamp</font>

585
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:06,820
so past hour we've got the history<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

586
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:12,100
this was supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> partial America</font>

587
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:12,100
and in some code changes

588
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:29,360
yes near here wrong for some reason see

589
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:32,070
so if you feel the configuration

590
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,920
emotionally for this application will

591
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:37,590
also dramatically preview the day so

592
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:42,000
translate it into a date and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gift for</font>

593
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:46,140
you nice thing about these doors so

594
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:51,560
process the images stored in the

595
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,560
database to go through them

596
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,620
we would need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix the interface a</font>

597
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,620
little bit

598
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:16,220
to put you for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the temporary</font>

599
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:20,000
files generated by sqlite the right

600
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:25,189
ahead to look for example which you

601
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,340
can't pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> you there are ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> acid</font>

602
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:30,800
anyways but we do you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on view in</font>

603
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:34,070
wood to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> heck's time of the</font>

604
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,990
application both we'd maybe extract some

605
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:40,400
information or you close<font color="#CCCCCC"> so bored to</font>

606
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,359
extract swings and you through the

607
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,610
strings and see what's in there as well

608
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:49,150
the same goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

609
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:51,980
device with Weaver if the application

610
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:56,360
recognizes the format it would pass it

611
00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:01,610
itself so it recognizes those<font color="#E5E5E5"> hp5</font>

612
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:05,200
database files xml files<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a person</font>

613
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,200
for you and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could view them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nicely</font>

614
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:18,950
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the music</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> player installed</font>

615
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:22,200
service collection air some<font color="#E5E5E5"> excel file</font>

616
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">pic you give you the contents of the</font>

617
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,410
five

618
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,060
so even without the modules you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

619
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:37,009
still do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis at this specific</font>

620
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,009
point of the application

621
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,110
alright so the next application I saw

622
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:03,990
creation for sim card forensics the

623
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:06,120
reason behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting this application</font>

624
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:09,149
or less was because I thought this

625
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:13,100
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play chief device about two</font>

626
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:17,880
pounds is a sim card reader and

627
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,680
supposedly he should<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk when Queen</font>

628
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,510
backups are<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting some fancy</font>

629
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,790
information from sim cards I've tried

630
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost all the applications i could get</font>

631
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:33,080
my hands on these on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my hands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do</font>

632
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:36,320
sim card forensics and known them worked

633
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,779
maybe I was doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong five</font>

634
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:42,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay couple of them work but then like</font>

635
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,070
the way they were doing things and I'm

636
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,380
also pretty chilling I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

637
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:51,930
buy more expensive more expensive

638
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:55,410
devices to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extraction so with</font>

639
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:58,830
that in mind basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to do</font>

640
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:01,799
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do was or less</font>

641
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:04,310
understand how the same cards work sim

642
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,820
cards or smart cards are essentially

643
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:11,820
full-blown devices they're everywhere

644
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">credit cards train tickets for most</font>

645
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:18,630
everyone the ones used in telecom in the

646
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:21,390
telecommunication industry run on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

647
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:24,210
Java card operating system which is

648
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:27,150
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java it more straight down</font>

649
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,850
and eat for this specific things so it's

650
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:36,060
a no credit is it it's a whole computer

651
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:40,020
system in a small device so in there too

652
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:42,450
we gotta see you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM or the other</font>

653
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,790
stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate with them for</font>

654
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:47,669
a specific protocol and ask for

655
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:51,870
information has been to execute<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to</font>

656
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:54,420
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stuff and so on so when you're</font>

00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:56,509
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> forensics on sim cards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't</font>

658
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,190
extract some information that

659

information is stored on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the seating</font>

661
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,289
the file system is structured more or

less<font color="#E5E5E5"> like any other file system it's up</font>

663
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:14,750
it has folders and files folders are

664

named dedicated files and files a

667
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:33,589
using the apdu protocol over a serial

668
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:36,649
connection information<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sim card that</font>

669
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:38,808
could be useful in forensic analysis the

00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,940
ID number of the sim card the mobile

671
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:43,400
subscriber number of the user which will

672
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,480
tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country the network the</font>

actual subscriber identification<font color="#CCCCCC"> under</font>

card the last dial numbers and location

676
00:42:55,309 --> 00:43:01,160
information so the last location of the

sim card go by n these are still there

678
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,788
except the smss are<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">nowadays but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one every devices you will</font>

680
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:14,420
see the low key<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LMD last higher</font>

681
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:19,368
numbers location information being there

00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:22,720
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDS we see how you do</font>

683
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:25,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just go through this</font>

684
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,459
specific one so when you connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

685
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,589
sim card what you do we communicate we

00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:34,010
initiated connection with a sim card

687
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:38,420
with a smart card and then you say we

688
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:40,670
should command specific bites different

689
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,849
commands different with bites and so on

690
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:46,849
and you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want to select for</font>

691
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">example go into this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> directory which is</font>

files<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have names they just have</font>

695
00:43:55,849 --> 00:44:00,920

696
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,860
root directory is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> then work what I</font>

697
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,410
want to read the file

00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:10,420
tell the sim card give me the contents
