48
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:12,150
generally compelling usually it's fine

so the priests are on yet not definitely

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,160
not just sales but everything from sort

of technical account management<font color="#CCCCCC"> fruta</font>

55
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,649
bit nature so what am I doing here I

56
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,679
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know we give away his</font>

sins<font color="#E5E5E5"> relish but actually seems I'm here</font>

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,480
it'd be quite good and educate couple of

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,880
extra blossoms but you know he booked a

60
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,230
couple a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years back when I was up</font>

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">here doing some work at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherd out</font>

62
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,040
eventually and coming what it was and

63
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,480
that was my wife's birthday or

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,959
anniversary but I thought of splash

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,519
water bottle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one reason at me</font>

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,620
let's help see how the reason I've got a

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,190
call from David asking I've done view

68
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,150
presentations before coming as RSA but I

69
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,640
thought to come in and just keep

70
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,590
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> not San SAR SE focused or</font>

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,109
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Regis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore what</font>

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,820
I've see I've been probably 50 to 100

73
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,260
different sock environment see how gonna

74
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,350
be well so you have to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

75
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,890
badly excuse my experience of what I've

76
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,890
seen on site

77
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,390
so again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a topic titled</font>

78
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Peter the book anyway so mercy no way</font>

79
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,750
over here

80
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so just going to start with a few</font>

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">different logos you may know sort of</font>

82
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:41,140
bored here so its way villages to<font color="#E5E5E5"> load</font>

83
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:45,750
up rather than do this on mouse click

84
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:48,730
the prince went to show you this is from

85
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,069
hang on gimme which gives you a nice

86
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,018
base feel sort of companies this year's

87
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,298
of this year that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've experienced the</font>

88
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber attack so some big names there</font>

89
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">which is like a sexy these are large</font>

90
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,610
organizations with big security teams

91
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,709
global environment and still getting

92
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,200
breach<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm system recognize their</font>

93
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling ec-council which happen to</font>

94
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,130

95
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:19,120
training courses so we should 14

96
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:21,519
different course so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> xbox go to show</font>

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,560
here is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I see is a big blank</font>

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,620
box but what i like to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

99
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,270
threat landscape so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just what we</font>

100
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,190
know but something known and unknown

101
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,320
threats and this one I see this is the

102
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">big window opportunity the big threat</font>

103
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,570

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,780
that with the way people<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

105
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,159
security at the moment right keyboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

people are implementing in place which

108
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,380
gives a certain amount of coverage so

109
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,700
for example and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> virus give us a</font>

113
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,500
with our technologies we can see that

114
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,080
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting good coverage here great</font>

115
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,910
use of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very controlled but actually</font>

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:54,399

we don't know necessarily we're looking

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,119
at very hard to detect that so even

166
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:08,079
things like and what we'll see more

176
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:26,438
I've been in quite a few environments

all this gifted defenses in place and

181
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:36,159
actually they tell me that users cannot

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,570
we find some plaintext passwords the

these questions and they seem very

205
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,120
simple questions but often they're quite

hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer just things like when an</font>

haven't got anything there you don't

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a pinch on working to the</font>

presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> but actually started some</font>

sort of debate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> merely co-leading</font>

216
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,060
duck or not we couldnt actually find a

00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,410
better image<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start and figured</font>

again that's all pointed out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the so</font>

220
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,400
it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that level</font>

221
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,000
visibility we can't see its legs we've

222
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,260
done what's going on so with visibility

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,820
there's obviously a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different tools</font>

224
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,400
out there give us this or level of

225
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,890
visibility the well as mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

226
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,120
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort netflow so really just having a</font>

227
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:13,060
look have what what sort of traffic is

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,730
we say on the network so network /<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco</font>

229
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,790
and really originally used for sort of

230
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">network troubleshooting or performance</font>

231
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,319
management but servicing offers some

232
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,380
sort of security value as well we can

233
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually see from timings and theta fit</font>

234
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,199
seven why it doesn't allow that

235
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,959
questions to the second heir full packet

236
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:35,550
capture is it's really allowing us to

237
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,888
see how the years things go on a while

238
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:41,579
so we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about sort of sitting</font>

239
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,290
in line via tap or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fall and and</font>

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,430
sending to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full paper captured by</font>

242
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,329
everything's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wire</font>

243
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,810
I'm serious quite a few challenges with

244
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">tackling our date so there's quite a bit</font>

245
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,329
of data was there in a vision<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,930
some network<font color="#E5E5E5"> through pursue actually</font>

248
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,850
capturing everything on the wire it's

249
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,800
looking at maybe 100 big<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network you're</font>

250
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,170
looking at some terabyte data storage

251
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,290
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day so we have been massive</font>

252
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,089

253
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,160
through but your real enhance or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

254
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">terabytes day the solar networks that's</font>

255
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,420
all I deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 gigabits per second</font>

256
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,130
networks you're looking at sort of 600

257
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,780
terawatts days you're capturing every

258
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,610
single day and if you want a month's

259
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,230
worth potential on that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

260
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,270
at sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pest box but the data so</font>

261
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,850
massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> datasets so I guess there's a</font>

262
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,890
challenge in itself to actually capture

263
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,960
the data but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then also actually be able</font>

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sense so if you can imagine if</font>

265
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,150
yet maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> a terabyte of data using</font>

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,600
cellular nature probably quite a hard

 you looking for especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

269
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,130
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know exactly what it looks like so</font>

270
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,690
just to show you example this we've got

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some 31 sessions there</font>

285
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,790
it's also a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and this</font>

286
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,470
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see here we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a full</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">day to capture extracting in change</font>

288
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,460
boots out the traffic so interesting

289
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,650
header information so you can as you see

290
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,540
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it stopped learning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> citizen services</font>

291
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,430
and how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed them we can see the</font>

292
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">host names will IP addresses port</font>

293
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,880
numbers anything interesting and the

294
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,830
benefit of obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is we can</font>

295
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,780
scale from massive deployed runs massive

296
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,820
architectures and<font color="#CCCCCC"> data sets and we can</font>

297
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,709
drill down to already so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

298
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for example just a single IP</font>

299
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:08,070
address we can pivot the whole day steps

300
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,069
by clicking on a suit what games

301
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,130
addition to that we can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

302
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,199
looking at sessions we can do

303
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,320
reconstruction as well so here's an

304
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,780
example of a an email to<font color="#CCCCCC"> trustee clown</font>

305
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,390
it appears<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be with an email and</font>

306
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,829
rather than looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the</font>

307
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,540
traditional wedding looking package we

308
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,130
can squeak and struck that of ceiling

309
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,630
see it was too but it's from there's any

310
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,160
attachments because we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got that full</font>

311
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,290
packet capture we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

312
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,020
everything was transmitted level of wire

313
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can extract that it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet in</font>

314
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,920
this case there's a facebook link there

315
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,450
and actually it's all we using here just

316
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,420
to reconstruct that actually with you

317
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:49,210
try to take on it shows its it doesn't

318
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,319
actually match the<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook over there</font>

319
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,880
is actually going straight to an IP

320
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:58,000
address so<font color="#E5E5E5"> still go through through an</font>

321
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,610
example of something I've seen on site I

322
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,310
was going through it your day off the

323
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,560
not looking

324
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,569
about a year and half the notices report

325
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,069
pretty much summarizes actly what I saw

326
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,580
inside the time when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some</font>

327
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,960
forensic investigation in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it</font>

328
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,840
was bought an evaluation for an

329
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,090
organization who have enough stuff to

330
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,610
make compelling after that they saw they

331
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,860
had some loss and<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchased the solution</font>

332
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,260
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going too deep into it</font>

333
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,300
but yeah after just putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sliding</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">scale Tiote i found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it one favorable</font>

335
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,740
sort of details a lot of why fountains

336
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,510
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish you had a couple years get</font>

337
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,190
would have made things a lot easier but

338
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,300
this is a just pop up on the screen here

339
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:41,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important been generated by</font>

paper and

342
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,190
and the other good thing about this as

343
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,160
well just happens to be a coincidence

344
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:01,579
but it's actually been in the news

345
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,149
lately<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs July the temp this post is</font>

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:10,100
it's also spotted on the National Crime

Police and that just to combat this

353
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,370
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big problem that I see</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">my example was open a while back but</font>

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an organization that I can work</font>

they've got all their<font color="#E5E5E5"> primitive defenses</font>

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,250
using 30 terabytes worth of data so this

374
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,430
just is the organizational<font color="#E5E5E5"> din to have</font>

375
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,560
redacted quite a lot this for you there

376
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,829
is to give you some idea of how through

377
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:27,119
the investigation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> since show you the</font>

380
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,970
straight away without having to go

381
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,560
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> low level on the packet level I</font>

382
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,750
can get an overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the traffic</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">over at reasonable time period it happen</font>

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,760
to be overnight lets you see some top

385
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,079
that was amazed errands for the user's

386
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,080
activity there's a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stood out</font>

387
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,360
there for me definitely the<font color="#CCCCCC"> su in the CC</font>

388
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,150
so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just getting the data</font>

389
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,680
around that we can actually say great

390
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,300
show me a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information around</font>

391
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,819
that so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Richie really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

392
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,790
mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so here we see it comes in</font>

393
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,010
services nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ovie compelling you can</font>

394
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,199
see we've passed one is dns and one is

395
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,390
HTTP deal one hasn't been recognized by

396
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:11,460
our protocol passes so to convert their

397
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:13,949
as other because our full packet capture

398
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,450
as well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

399
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,470
everything is going as a wire so in this

400
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,780
case that we're using a proxy

401
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,740
architecture and they were doing ntlm

402

authentication to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluecoats some reason</font>

403
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,570
we'll see first<font color="#CCCCCC"> recipes use ticketing</font>

404
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,949
system like some Kerberos or something

405
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,900
let's say they raised n CN

406
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,450
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to extract the</font>

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,400

accountability for the person or the

409
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">usual campus was using doing this</font>

410
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:45,840

411
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:48,270
well so looking at the external

412
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,580
communications spread away there seems

413
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,170
to be some very interesting traffic so

414
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,870
we've got about<font color="#CCCCCC"> five different domains</font>

415
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:59,189
here or prefixed by this look more

416
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:01,380
pissed we randomly generated string and

417
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,650
these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different domains are not</font>

able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> CC and the su top level domains</font>

419
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,360
that's what we were drilled in at a time

420
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,938
there's a extra carefully that's a white

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,789
paper on top there which details exactly

422
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,799
what we would expect to see and or an

423
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:25,390
example of it which is exactly what we

424
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,889
were seeing this network as well between

425
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,460
see are there any of this randomly

426
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,409
generated strength beginning followed by

428
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:35,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing is a bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information that</font>

429
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:40,440
exactly how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was doing a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

430
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,440
more a deeper level<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrives he went into</font>

431
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
social reconstruction as well so

432
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,658
obviously the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last I was just looking at</font>

433
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data is extracted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a session but we</font>

434
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:49,899
can reconstruct the whole session as

435
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,649
well in this case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the best</font>

436
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:55,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">example because it was a big one doing</font>

437
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:58,059
any sort of SSL decryption didn't have a

438
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,639
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> man of it all prices and so all</font>

439
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:02,590
we saw was we saw this connection

440
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:05,949
through the proxy I used to be connect

441
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,870
we see the host<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were trying to</font>

442
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:12,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect to and it's pretty much all week</font>

443
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,870
see this isn't obviously great because

444
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,639
we've got no accountability to be lost

445
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,658
in a network help see if we go to

<font color="#E5E5E5">creepers information we could have done</font>

447
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:24,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but obviously it just example you</font>

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,570
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using friction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its desk this wasn't</font>

449
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,908
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the scenario</font>

450
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,820
because I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are doing all the</font>

451
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:31,960
traffic

452
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,730
we have to steal up internal

453
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,619
communications so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just</font>

454
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,869
looking at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is this user active</font>

455
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:40,449
what they've been doing so again just

456
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:42,399
filtering just by this host itself being

457
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,899
seen again lost different traffic again

458
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,758
lots of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> travelers which we</font>

459
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:51,309
wouldn't expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also see</font>

460
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:56,350
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> SMBs mar pc traffic so doing a bit</font>

461
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:59,859
of research<font color="#E5E5E5"> ashby and yeah look at the</font>

SMB<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiation spring the SMB traffic</font>

463
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,029
system it was a lil bit more than one

464
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,220
weird expect there and as you just

465
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:08,619
really do a google search highlighted

466
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:12,159
some of ours vulnerabilities that people

467
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:13,779
could exploit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairway looking into</font>

468
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,989
this we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is some of</font>

469
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:19,989
you see vulnerabilities and easy smart

<font color="#CCCCCC">PC traffic so slow a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low key into that</font>

471
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:24,159
we can see the RPC was to the

472
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:26,039
destination IP addresses which happened

473
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,450
to be served inside our environment and

474
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,489
swings<font color="#CCCCCC"> at applying they shouldn't</font>

475

00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:36,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">should have access to everything all</font>

477
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:39,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">English jeans what we can see is what</font>

478
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:42,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">expected some random buffer overflow</font>

479
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:46,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">will appears to the RBC overflow random</font>

480
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:49,299
Texas weekly I saw earlier and the in

481
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:53,340
the exploit and we see that traffic many

482
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:58,330
times over to these destination servers

483
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,639
so in this case the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual i went to a</font>

484
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:04,359
finish of it was having from blurring

485
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,889
out really what we saw as we saw lots of

486
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,610
users like the organization have

487
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:10,620
documents folders and also

488
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,689
and their desktops being backed up to

489
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,239
file servers and active directory

service inside their environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

491
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,309
what happens is my machine at belterra

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320

assume in this instance that they

exfiltrated quite their data to these
