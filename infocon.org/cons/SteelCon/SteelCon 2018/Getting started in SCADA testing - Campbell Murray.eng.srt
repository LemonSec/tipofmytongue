1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:23,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello good morning first of all</font>

2
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's say thank you to Robin and the</font>

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,590
organizers of Steel contra inviting me

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">long to talk today I did originally</font>

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,790
think I was going to be doing two talks

6
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:34,190
so I submitted through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFP to do a</font>

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,570
talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> skarda testing and they're</font>

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,640
getting scared of environments up and

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,010
running and was then asked what I do the

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,200
keynote oh yeah sure I'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> as final</font>

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">due to to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my problem to find that</font>

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:52,660
actually that's one and the same is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really can everybody hear me yes cool</font>

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,610
excellent so what I've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is try</font>

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine two talks into one to try</font>

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,950
and hit some keynote but also to provide

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,780
you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> some information around skarda</font>

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,420
so I started to see a thread for me and

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,939
what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you about however</font>

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,409
there's also a third element in this

21
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,479
mixture and I'm looking at the

22
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,220
organizers of Steel con for this steel

23
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,979
con<font color="#CCCCCC"> are known for wanting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do things a</font>

24
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,840
little bit differently this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

25
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,700
be quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different talk but anyway</font>

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,979
well do a bit of a normal talk to begin

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,710
with and things will go sideways shortly

28
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,110
trust me<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right ooh am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I call my name</font>

29
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,080
is Campbell<font color="#E5E5E5"> Murray I'm a technical</font>

30
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,640
director encryption limited I was

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally founder of a tiger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skiing</font>

32

certification scheme back in 2007 I also

33
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,369
founded the cyber scheme in 2013 I'm

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,220
banging around in the information

35
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,229
security industry for over 17 years I've

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,658
a gay teen years this year I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

37
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,479
they're about offensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and defensive</font>

38
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,070
roles throughout all of those so I've

39
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,229
seen a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes and number of</font>

40
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">developments in what we do what we</font>

41
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,030
perceive to be information security and

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,750
how we go about helping our customers in

43
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,520
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> roles during during that time so</font>

44
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is going to be a game of two houses</font>

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,530
talks it's going to be a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes of</font>

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,700
some common<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense normal talk and I</font>

47
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,310
brought some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common sense</font>

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,279
hopefully followed by something which is

49
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,069
being dubbed blind slight not sure I

50
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,490
think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a john carroll who came up</font>

51
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,560
with this

52
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,210
what's basically going to happen and I'm

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,550
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drag my slides out as long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

54
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:34,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly can yes I am Mike is to turn</font>

55
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,600
the conference dog on its head there are

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,360
a number of slides which have been a

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,100
crowdsourced which will be stuck into

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,090
this machine at some point during this

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,310
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have not seen them I have</font>

60
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,660
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no idea what something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

61
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,640
really big I'm terrified what I was like

62
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,020
well apparently I'll be fine I have been

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,760
told the only information I've been

64
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,440
given is that there are an equal<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,359
of slides which contain Disney

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,780
characters two slides which contain

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,340
images of pregnant men so we'll see what

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens anyway it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be a laugh is</font>

69
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,690
nothing else so what I wanted to talk

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,799
about partly was the sign waiver testing

71
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,040
not something I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in this industry</font>

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,810
a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've seen trends come</font>

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,269
and go over the years particularly

74
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,360
driven by the clients in particular now

75
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:26,150
I'm a pen tester first and foremost and

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,560
I started out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government area</font>

77
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,810
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mid to late 90s I've seen pen</font>

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,060
testing or what we dubbed pen testing at

79
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,670
the time going from an average<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

80
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">six-month engagement where we've</font>

81
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,059
literally give it a target told nothing

82
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and said right in between</font>

83
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,350
january and<font color="#E5E5E5"> july you're going to find</font>

84
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,090
out everything you possibly can you will

85
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,880
get a job at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that company you need to be</font>

86
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,470
you will get in there you will find

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,710
extract all of their information in any

88
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,900
way possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> catalogue and document</font>

89
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,550
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> exfiltration route that</font>

90
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,010
this organization or company presents

91
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,540
you that was when there weren't an awful

92
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,890
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the industry knocking</font>

93
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,200
around there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty specialist stuff</font>

94
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,700
we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really push a heads above the</font>

95
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,230
parapet and say hey we're pen testers

96
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,380
because it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a thing back</font>

97
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,140
then what we found was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

98
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,120
myself moved out of that sphere in which

99
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,370
we worked and became consultants who

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,769
became more commercial we started

101
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">attracting the interest of other clients</font>

102
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,490
other companies big and small start to

103
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,630
see the benefits of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did but they</font>

104
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,730
didn't have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of budget or</font>

105
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying drivers the introduction of</font>

106
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,820
compliance particularly around

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">government's IT health checks for the</font>

109
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,700
public bodies have to be

110
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,419
including now from this year the police

111
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,280
sources to gain a PSN connection you

112
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,570
have to submit a code of connection

113
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,250
saying that you've done certain things

114
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,190
and part of that is to have a pen test

115
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,350
it's gone so regulated and mandated that

116
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,590
what we do now and the way we win work

117
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,140
is based on price not on how good you

118
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,380
are schemes like the tiger scheme cyber

119
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,930
skiing crest and CSG<font color="#CCCCCC"> daren't GCHQ the</font>

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:08,370
scheme of check scheme give clients a

121
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,290
baseline<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is satisfactory</font>

regulatory<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance around the people</font>

they're doing but within the industry

126
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,539
even people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who've got the</font>

127
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,789
qualifications we all have slightly

128
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,380
different approaches and pen testing

129
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,260
communities being largely constricted

130
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,450
and constrained and being dictated how

131
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,780
we actually dig things it got down to

132
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,219
the point where a pen test unknown in

133
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,130
just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back in sort of</font>

134
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,540
2010 we were winning tests and work on

135
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,570
the basis that yet we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> your IT</font>

136
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,640
health check in two days that's it how

137
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,200
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> value does that actually have the</font>

138
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,110
clients quickly realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

139
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,510
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of value in having a network</font>

that supports<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> employees being pen</font>

141
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,170

<font color="#E5E5E5">get tool output but they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simply didn't</font>

143
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,660
want to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it because they had to</font>

147
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,780
time you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let these people use</font>

148
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,299
their imaginations let them explore get

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,710
that bog standard mechanical part the

150
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,960
pen test out the way then going through

151
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">your minds have a look around what would</font>

152
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,289
you do if I was an employee in the

153
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,969
company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked there for a year or</font>

154
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,790
two and I got to really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

155
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,320
systems I'd be exfiltrating data in all

156
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,380
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways that just simply</font>

157
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,969
wouldn't be found<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a pen test but what</font>

158
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,159
I'm not so happy about what the industry

159
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,370
is the resurgence of the word red

160
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,130
teaming because I was a red team now to

161
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,830
be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> niced what a red team exercise</font>

162
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,719
is now is a pen test and what from what

163
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the industry a bit social</font>

164
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,870
engineering that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not red team red</font>

165
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,359
teaming is taking thermite to the door

166
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,710
hinges of a rhino steel door burning the

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,300
damn thing down and hitting it

168
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,169
repeatedly with a sledgehammer until it

169
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,050
falls over

170
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:55,139
that's red team so I'm not a big fan of

171
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,659
the term<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used in the context</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

172
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,939
it is now but it does show an upsurge on

173
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:02,938
the sine wave of the clients demands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

174
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,139
clients expectations of what we do and

175
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,340
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to longer</font>

176
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,009
engagement so we're going back to

177
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,198
opening up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope and saying is a</font>

178
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,759
blanket scope this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> who we are you</font>

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,698
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can detect your activity and</font>

182
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:20,930
work out what's you and what's not and

183
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:27,449
that's a healthy thing for the industry

184
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:29,699
it's maturing but it's maturing in in a

185
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,139
slightly tan genital way and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

186
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,029
what I'm really looking at is the

187
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,819
requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of pen</font>

188
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:37,199
testers when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started in the industry</font>

189
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,029
other people didn't really say what they

190
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">did nobody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really knew their what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

191
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware of pockets of people doing stuff</font>

192
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,349
here and there but now it's a it's a

193
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,810
career path you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to university and</font>

194
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:50,639
sit a degree in penetration testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

195
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,689
ethical hacking there are loads of

196
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,789
courses<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take to become</font>

197

198
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,839
level of maturity now where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pen</font>

out into the industry are being created

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,669
and very formulaic way being<font color="#E5E5E5"> given a</font>

202
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:08,339
very prescriptive methodology and

<font color="#CCCCCC">toolset</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use whereas the appetite for</font>

205
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,120

206
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,770
at some point in the very near future a

skills gap in its own right<font color="#CCCCCC"> though we</font>

about it you just kind of by luck and

judgment not my lack of judgment p by

217
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a typical career path but now</font>

218
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,679
it's a conscious choice that people have

219
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,870
decided when<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to university or when</font>

picking their employers that that is

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to do that's where</font>

into the industry so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has matured but</font>

225
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:59,880
there are always opportunities to learn

not just from happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> tifton saying I'm</font>

230
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,780

testers do pen testers have imagination

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,430
and creativity that's a defining role

233
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,860
now always opportunities to learn from

<font color="#E5E5E5">each other and from every engagement</font>

235
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,770
which we undertake we should be learning

something new we should be seeing

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,260
something that we never seen before I

239
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,720
and I'm still learning I learn something

<font color="#CCCCCC">new every week we've principal to</font>

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,730
people is a notion that we had an

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,530
skills gap we're really ignoring number

256
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,810
of key areas we have to ask ourselves

257
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:13,990
why are they vulnerabilities in systems

258
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:16,569
an unwise there are very very few good

259
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,200
quality courses and education parts that

260
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:24,340
people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take to become developers</font>

261
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,200
creating robust code there isn't really

262
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,790
as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I'm aware and correct</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me if</font>

I'm wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> a university course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we can</font>

264
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,099
go and learn to code C sharp securely

265
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,590
generally the role of the developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

266
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,910
to produce code on deadline on budget

267
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,470
and ship it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll deal with the bugs</font>

268
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,969
later and that's something that really

269
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,960
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change but there's nobody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

leave with frankly crippling debt

324
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,290
whereas the alternative is there where

325
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:02,470
you can shortcut this process enter

326
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,779
earlier if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to sustain yourself</font>

on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> living wage throughout and leave</font>

328
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,379
with some very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good job prospects</font>

329
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,449
having already made contacts in the

00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:12,970
industry having shadow professionals

331
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:15,160
having spent time in placements in

information security and industry

333
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,689

334
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,039
pans out I'll have high hopes for it it

335
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:24,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be a lot of work</font>

336
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:28,819
so we were going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skarda</font>

337
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:30,779
and that was the what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're promised</font>

338
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:32,939
and Robin did say you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

339
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,799
highly technical talk well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

340
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:36,539
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too technical but thinking</font>

00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:40,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this over the last few days it did</font>

00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:43,229
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up an interesting point arounds</font>

00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,969
what we do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry have the</font>

00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:47,699
different approaches and different

attitudes people have towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting</font>

346

347
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:57,209
carder or is it SCADA and the reason I

348
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,409
bring this up is I have a really funny

349
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,689
conversation I'll never forget this

350
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:03,119
conversation many years ago when into a

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tech guys find out what they've</font>

354
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:11,279

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,649
them asked me the question well what

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,029
sort of platforms to use what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

large we like to use a linux operating

system<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric we've got more tools it's</font>

365
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:30,599
more configurable we can knock up

366
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:32,488
scripts quickly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see something we</font>

know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux's yeah okay well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

370
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,619
um it's an open source operating system

371
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,449
that has a slightly different panel

375
00:14:53,909 --> 00:15:00,299
often is the snobbery around our

00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:03,899
technical approaches about our little

00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:13,319
it should be done and everybody else is

381
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,449
wrong and that's something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> crippling</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> skarda is also because the scars</font>

are testing industry are exactly that

410
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,279
they have almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> built a fortress around</font>

411
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,839
what they want to do they push out the

414
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,630
shouldn't because the starter experts

415
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,250
are always trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like to build</font>

434
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,089
one of the reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted this to be</font>

435
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,938
brief and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> prove actually how simple</font>

436
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,250
it is what's ICS you may hear that term

437
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,169
is an industrial control system it's not

438
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">black magic it's an industrial control</font>

system it controls industrial systems

440
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,419
that's it there is no more to it it's

441
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,500
probably windows-based it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably an</font>

442
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,390
awful lot more familiar to you

<font color="#CCCCCC">you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine but just because it's</font>

446

447
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,760
feel that you require specific industry

experience or certification<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">skarda that's a system that talks to</font>

450
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,890
industrial control systems and gets

451
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,990
information from it that's all there is

452
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:08,950
you can draw analogies to industrial

453
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,470
control systems and scada setups to SNMP

454
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,910
in in a standard office network it's

455
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,130
basically doing the same thing you have

456
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,950
a SNMP trap which is monitoring

457
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,870
different systems you hook into that and

458
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,880
get information about what's what's down

459
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,909
who's doing what that's it it's as

460
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple as that conceptually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pentest and</font>

461
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,320
scarred our infrastructure does differ a

462
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,900
little bit because we use some different

463
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,080
tools that occasionally a little

464
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,340
different tool but not an awful lot

465
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,050
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you fired up creating a</font>

developer's environment nice and easy

467
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,770
there's two tools there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

pretty standard I believe the slides

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,860
will be available so don't worry about

482
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,730
typically in repose I mean if everybody

483
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,139
was knocking about with ICS stuff then

484
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,570
yeah these would just been standing

<font color="#CCCCCC">repose but you do need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add the keys</font>

technology it's a system that provides

information and you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at ways</font>

of communicating with us

500
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:07,220
everything I've just said in the last 20

minutes or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no next step</font>

is whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do this is where</font>

503
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,800
your pen testing starts is by examining

504
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,810
following a<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a rigid methodology but</font>

505
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,720
following a scientific methodology to

506
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:24,320
observe what's in front of you callate

507
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,480
that information hypothesize what could

508
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,780
happen if you press that button there

509
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,780
will drop a cat on<font color="#E5E5E5"> lap and then test</font>

510
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,480
those hypotheses observe the results of

511
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,730
those and just redo the cycle over and

512
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,340
over again to some of the tools that you

513
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,170
can use are a fairly standard you will

514
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,330
probably want port<font color="#CCCCCC"> scanner you need to</font>

515
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:47,630
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some system fingerprinting probing</font>

516
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,770
for services once you've got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

517
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,580
you've got some information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

518
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:55,010
some exploit research and look manually

519
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,230
look for vulnerabilities and

520
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,690
configurations look for privilege

521
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:04,100
escalations in your systems test

522
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:07,100
passwords if they're in place there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

523
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,149
no how to do a scar detest there is no

524
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,500
real how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the penetration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test and</font>

525
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,120
maturity of the industry now is such

526
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,100
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we're telling people</font>

527
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm pushing people out into the industry</font>

528
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,320
then this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test is done it's</font>

529
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,120
very all<font color="#CCCCCC"> well good saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you</font>

530
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,679
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to do a pen test but that's</font>

531
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,629
not necessarily how pen test should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

532
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:33,110
done on<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

533
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:36,110
so what I'm really saying is take the

534
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,389
precious away from those ivory towers

535
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,800
which people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> building them in</font>

536
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,930
because if we're going to satisfy<font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

537
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,580
needs and the ongoing requirement for

538
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,830
information security skills in the

539
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,840
industry and globally going forwards we

540
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,909
can't remain<font color="#CCCCCC"> containerized we can't</font>

541
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,709
believe that the skills that we learn in

542
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">one set of courses is going to be</font>

543
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,210
adequate enough to push us forward and

544
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,889
actually replicate the activity of the

545
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,890

having security testing done to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,760
UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> is under attack every country is</font>

550
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,210
under attack I know our press like to

551
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,920
make some quote lots of figures about

552
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,570
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money we lose to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cybercrime and</font>

554
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,000
different to anyone else what is

555
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,710
different between the professionals in

556
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,230
the industry trying to shore up our

557
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,330
defenses and the criminals now they're

<font color="#E5E5E5">making a living out of us is that the</font>

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,780
have no time limit they have an ax scope

00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,880
of work they have no legal constraints

562
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,649
well they do but they ignore them I'm

567
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,900
you're different fences to take as many

568
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,540
imaginative routes to getting that data

569
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,130
