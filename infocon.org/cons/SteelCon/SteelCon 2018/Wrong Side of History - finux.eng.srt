00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:22,680
sorry guys so hi I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phoenix if</font>

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,689
la I'm going to talk about I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,860
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the similarities between the</font>

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Manhattan Project and the global</font>

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:33,030
surveillance news that came out recently

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,710
I say recently about two years ago I'm

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the Manhattan</font>

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,370
Project hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> up if you know what the</font>

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,269
Manhattan Project is ok I'll not do the

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,830
German joke but I this surprisingly a

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,120
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> i live in germany now if you're</font>

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,920
wondering where all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> german stuff</font>

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,239
comes from and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,620
manhattan project<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to talk</font>

15
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,169
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global surveillance project</font>

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,360
you know prism blah blah blah blah blah

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of the stuff that stopped the</font>

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,589
Guardian from going bankrupt yeah well

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,899
you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got to eat right</font>

20
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:12,390
like it's not let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not get bad so the</font>

21
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:15,690
first striking similarity between both

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,910
the Manhattan Project and the global

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,500
surveillance project is surprise

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,259
surprise they're both<font color="#E5E5E5"> top secret</font>

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,060
projects as I said this earlier on in

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,819
the highlight the Manhattan Project

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,590
employed a hundred and ten thousand

28
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:35,039
people a thousand knew what they were

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,470
doing so it can give you a rough idea

30
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:42,810
about what you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> really get away with</font>

31
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:45,840
without people noticing so the first

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,149
striking similarity between the

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Manhattan Project and the global</font>

34
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:56,759
surveillance stuff is that both both

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,119
instant both events both suffered from

36
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,789
whistleblowers<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

37
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,690
this guy called Klaus Fuchs do you guys

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:08,399
know who he is if you're a Brit you

39
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very ashamed of yourself right</font>

40
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,760
now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have a</font>

41
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:18,239
nuclear project in the UK ok Klaus Fuchs

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,569
was a German Jew who suddenly found that

43
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,690
home was a little bit hostile towards

44
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:29,250
the beginning of<font color="#CCCCCC"> World War two became a</font>

45
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,880
came to Britain<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeked asylum we gave it</font>

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font>

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:39,900
and the he became part of our equivalent

48
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,670
to the Manhattan Project he is also a

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,100
traitor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Great Britain as well and was</font>

50
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,549
convicted<font color="#CCCCCC"> for treason and sentenced to</font>

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,280
14 years he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

52
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,800
Soviet Union<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a nuclear weapon too</font>

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,900
but we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this later on so</font>

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,700
when you think about the damage that can

55
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,460
be done this name the soul that<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one</font>

56
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,130
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows did far much more than this</font>

57
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,750
one that we all know but all roads lead

58
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,650
to Russia as well rate which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

59
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,620
bit strange so for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

60
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,980
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the the manhattan project</font>

61
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,280
was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the manhattan project was</font>

62
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:26,160
about building a nuclear weapon so just

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,840
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> World War two starts they they</font>

64
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,590
manage to split the atom in Berlin and

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,520
everyone with a grade school like a high

66
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,520
school grade education in physics

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,950
understands very very quickly the damn

68
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,200
holy shit we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a bomb and we're</font>

69
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,109
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a war that might be really handy</font>

70
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,970
but to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair what was really hard for</font>

71
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,580
people to get their head around was

72
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,370
trying to explain a nuclear weapon to

73
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,440
people that only have experienced of of

74
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,570
conventional weapons is about explaining

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,280
bigger bangs right I mean it's a problem

76
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,980
that we have insecurities<font color="#CCCCCC"> or minutes</font>

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,270
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a bank</font>

78
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,950
though we've got bangs now but it's

79
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really big how big ten</font>

80
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,560
thousand times big your head just

81
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,600
doesn't comprehend it so how did the

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,709
Manhattan Project start well the

83
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,079
manhattan project started like all great

84
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:25,970
projects start by fear uncertainty and

85
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:30,120
doubt right so who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows who this guy is</font>

86
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">right Einstein Einstein had a choice of</font>

87
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,470
coming to Britain had a choice going to

88
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:39,030
America where do you think he went<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

89
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:42,820
he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to America right so he writes</font>

90
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,659
some he writes a letter

91
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,900
and goes to see the US president and

92
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:53,710
explains to the US president that the

93
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">Germans Hitler has a nuke ray he's going</font>

94
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to nuke you you need to start building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

95
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,110
nuclear weapon they have weapons of mass

96
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,180
destruction and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't start now</font>

97
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,840
we're done it's over we need to start

98
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,210
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> now he was as famous then as he is</font>

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,940
now right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of</font>

100
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,810
the world's most famous scientists

101
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:19,930
telling an American president Bill de

102
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:24,100
nuke what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think happened the</font>

103
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,900
manhattan project started<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it today</font>

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,720
is still one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most expensive</font>

105
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,719
projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the US military ran okay</font>

106
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:41,170
this do you guys know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is no</font>

107
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:44,230
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuclear reactor this is</font>

108
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,700
actually the first nuclear reactor this

109
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:50,410
is where it all goes batshit insane

110
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:55,090
right they built this in Chicago under a

111
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:58,390
sports field not not any nuclear reactor

112
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:02,169
as well the first nuclear reactor they

113
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,940
had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea these are control rods and</font>

114
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,790
they pull them out to start the nuclear

115
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,980
reaction okay I can guarantee you if you

116
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,290
built a nuclear reactor in your basement

117
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,860
you're probably going to go to jail

118
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,930
right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a challenge for you to</font>

119
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,060
accept by the way it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just friendly</font>

120
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,870
advice it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something I would get</font>

121
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">into they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Health and Safety</font>

122
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,970
officers there with buckets of distilled

123
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,580
water because you know neurons of scared

124
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,860
shitless of distilled water wrote that

125
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,690
no idea what<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going on and they built</font>

126
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,060
this and what they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove is</font>

127
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:42,640
that they could they could start a

128
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:46,540
reaction process and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the project</font>

129
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">begins so what we find with theory is</font>

130
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,650
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to think about shit</font>

131
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:55,830
right it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to put it into</font>

132
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:58,770
practice so they knew that they could

133
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,770
it an atom and produce a nuclear

134
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,900
reaction they just weren't too sure

135
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,400
about the best way to go about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

136
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,120
what they knew is the materials<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

137
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,020
they had were not sufficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the job</font>

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:17,490
basically they needed uranium 238 which

139
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:20,219
they'd only ever produced in am in lab

140
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:24,830
quantities which is a you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

141
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:27,210
of grains of sand what they needed was

142
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,940
pounds and pounds and pounds of this

143
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,950
material and no idea how to do it so

144
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first problem that they had</font>

145
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve and it was a bit of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

146
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,820
for him because there's different

147
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:44,310
theories of how you could enrich uranium

148
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,710
so it was wartime it was to save the

149
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,330
wall it was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> save civilization to stop</font>

150
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,880
Hitler<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being so bad blah blah blah</font>

151
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,919
blah blah so they hedge their bets in

152
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,140
went through every way that they knew to

153
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">enrich uranium they'll have a go up and</font>

154
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:02,280
they built a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of plants it's like</font>

155
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:05,789
two billion dollars in in u.s. wartime

156
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">two billion dollars in 1944 right all 40</font>

157
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,920
well early forties they they spent two

158
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,490
Boeing but the equivalent of 26 billion

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,740
dollars today so pretty cheap if we

160
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:23,190
think about the the what we spend now in

161
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:27,600
war interesting story for you they the

162
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:30,240
Los Alamos plant consumed<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10% of wartime</font>

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,610
america's electricity to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into</font>

164
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,590
context with you they use more

165
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,490
electricity than Chicago and Boston put

166
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:40,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">together right no one noticed so anyway</font>

167
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,960
they built they build a number of plants

168
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,630
here are here are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them five of</font>

169
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,630
them Los Alamos is probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

170
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,550
famous this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a gaseous in fusion plant</font>

171
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,850
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting you see these</font>

172
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:56,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these legs here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this new shape</font>

173
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,780
for the building these are half a mile

174
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,960
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only up till nineteen eighty</font>

175
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">their 1983 I think the US government</font>

176
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,860
disclosed what this building<font color="#CCCCCC"> was up</font>

177
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,360
until then they didn't which

178
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,490
quite interesting because this was the

179
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">largest military building ever built and</font>

180
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:20,560
still no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one no astray they had no when</font>

181
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">they built it they had no idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,449
were going to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just knew it</font>

183
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,930
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be big right that's that's</font>

184
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:32,530
all they knew so when they laid the

185
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,969
foundations for this thing they didn't

186
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,260
know they didn't know what they were

187
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,510
going to put on the roof right there

188
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,010
hadn't thought that far ahead here they

189
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,050
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed to get up it's also</font>

190
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,310
slightly radioactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so don't go</font>

191
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,109
visiting right general groves is an

192
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,719
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> character he's the guy that</font>

193
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">built the Pentagon he's also the guide</font>

194
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,850
the military arm that supported all of

195
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,380
these physicists we talked a little bit

196
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,070
about him in a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> while he's a</font>

197
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,170
famous story he I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that physicists</font>

198
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,090
and hackers we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit in</font>

199
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,790
common at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment right so you have</font>

200
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:09,190
this military guy go to his military

201
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,469
leaders and say I can't work with these

202
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,540
physicists they're all prima donnas I

203
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,640
just cannot get a straight answer out of

204
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,930
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> every time I speak to them they</font>

205
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,030
just speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me in a different language</font>

206
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:30,939
sounds a little bit familiar right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

207
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:33,100
hear this all the time so so an example

208
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,770
that he gave is when Hugh spoke to his

209
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:40,720
physicists about building some of their

210
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:42,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">plants the physicists said oh because</font>

211
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,360
they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the you know this was a</font>

212
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:49,000
research project right they they gave

213
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,560
their estimates to a factor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 ok</font>

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,750
which doesn't sound this sounds like a

215
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,310
conservative but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you have this</font>

216
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,040
military guy who builds military

217
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,109
buildings like the Pentagon who isn't

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,819
really used to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray area you need</font>

219
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,980
to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in black and white what you</font>

220
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,740
want and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will build it that's kind of</font>

221
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,220
how this works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he was explaining to</font>

222
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,820
Eisenhower do it's like me arranging a

223
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,790
wedding party for tab for a thousand

224
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,610
people but maybe 30 or turn up or maybe

225
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">3,000 or turn up you know the you know</font>

226
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,649
you can't expect me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build these</font>

227
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,959
things

228
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,809
and basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said was shut up</font>

229
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,989
and build these things so the scientist

230
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,980
one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in this story room but</font>

231
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,399
they're interesting thing about Los

232
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,649
Alamos she's a this is an interesting

233
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,129
plan so a guy called Oppenheimer oh you

234
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,959
know I'm pretty sure you've heard of he

235
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:43,850
he was asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead of the project he's a</font>

236
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a controversial choice to</font>

237
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,759
say the least right he he spoke to gross

238
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:52,040
and what grows wanted to do was split

239
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,540
all the scientists up and put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

240
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,990
different parts of the country because

241
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">of security right departmentalized your</font>

242
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:02,509
resources so that if someone compromised

243
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,089
as a site they don't have the whole

244
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:07,790
picture which is very typical in a

245
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:11,300
military way of doing things not so

246
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,649
typical for theoretical physicists who

247
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building the world's first nuclear</font>

248
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,319
weapon they might need to be around each

249
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,990
other so they came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution</font>

250
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:22,939
where they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a camp</font>

251
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,290
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> for building a nuclear</font>

252
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:26,540
weapon that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring in all</font>

253
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,129
the brightest and then we're going to

254
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,730
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the camp the problem with is</font>

255
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:33,620
deep you don't take lessons from Chicago

256
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,329
right so in Chicago you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have build a</font>

257
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,399
nuclear reactor and fuck the sea right

258
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,050
they've sat down and thought about it

259
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,209
and when you know what let's um let's

260
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,429
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of nowhere right</font>

261
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:45,589
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in case something goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

262
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,139
let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not put it in a dense</font>

263
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:50,029
popular area so they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the middle</font>

264
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:55,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the desert 200 miles away from</font>

265
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:58,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything another interesting security</font>

266
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,040
talk right aspect always be careful

267
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what knowledge you know and where</font>

268
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,110
you disclose it and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for this</font>

269
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:09,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">is so they build Los Alamos they start</font>

270
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,269
shipping all of these physicists away

271
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:15,799
there and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this little train</font>

272
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:17,929
station that nobody is ever used ever so

273
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,179
you go to Chicago catch the train into

274
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:23,360
this place you get picked up in an army

275
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">G and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken off the Los Alamos so the</font>

276
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">train clerk I started noticing that that</font>

277
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:31,160
station that in the whole 20 odd years

278
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,220
that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working here no one has</font>

279
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,589
ever taken a train to all of a sudden we

280
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,540
start

281
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,830
selling tickets and there's nothing

282
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and to compound that problem</font>

283
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,310
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even getting return tickets</font>

284
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:47,610
they're just getting single<font color="#E5E5E5"> tickets what</font>

285
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:51,119
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on needless to say he was</font>

286
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,680
relocated from his position and we shall

287
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,950
move a talk of this gentleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

288
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,729
right but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC you know is it's</font>

289
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:03,540
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dream right so yeah we'll</font>

290
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:07,770
move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this stuff as i said the</font>

293
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,920
deployment numerous of these people had

294
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,220
no idea what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were doing they were</font>

295
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:26,219
doing just general day-to-day operations

296
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:29,340
so some of the plants had a whole city

297
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,050
culture attached to them I think I'll

298
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:36,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">McGirt oh I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the one in Tennessee</font>

was on the Mayflower right and it's a

309
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,280
bit like this with the manhattan project

310
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,750
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time right whenever they everyone</font>

311
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,569
had a story about working for the

manhattan project well there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> woman</font>

313
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,430
who did have a story she had a very

314
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:15,210
strange job of working in the launch

315
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,609
beam and waving this magic stick over

316
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:20,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laundry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and when the stick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

317

making noises she was to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get in</font>

318
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,599
general well the stick turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to be</font>

319
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:28,170
a Geiger counter and what she was was

320
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,060
decontamination so basically click click

321
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,040
click oh we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a leak I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,060
frontline decontamination so just give

325
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,370
you a rough idea about how need to know

326
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,310
it actually was I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that</font>

327
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,440
story's amazing right I don't know if

328
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,050
she ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> did he read he clicks right</font>

329
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm guessing knock she's still around to</font>

330
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:56,400
tell us that all is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still around to tell</font>

331
00:15:50,250 --> 00:16:00,930
the story so 1945 happens and who knows

332
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:06,900
what happens in 1945 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> German</font>

333
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:10,290
surrender so for a long time they've

334
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:13,290
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> building weapons to be specifically</font>

335
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:16,650
tuck the German threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that they're</font>

336
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Germans are going to nuke us and all</font>

337
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,209
of a sudden Germany it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a</font>

338
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,590
sudden it's not an unknown this is this

339
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,110
was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards royal but germany</font>

340
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,290
surrenders what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think happens to</font>

341
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Manhattan Project it just carries on</font>

342
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,870
going like Germany still in war remember

343
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,390
Germany had weapons of mass destruction

344
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,210
right and they were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nuke</font>

345
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,910
America and oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't do</font>

346
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:44,670
something now it will never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

347
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,760
able to do anything this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> German</font>

348
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:52,020
reactor the non-functional German

349
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:55,230
reactor turns out they were slightly

350
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,800
preoccupied with occupation and didn't

351
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:01,110
find too much time to do R&D for news so

352
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,099
they had very very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little in the</font>

353
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:07,410
way of any program whatsoever at all

354
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">although I will tell you whether their</font>

355
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,720
research turns up is quite interesting

356
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:15,839
right so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the inspection</font>

357
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,720
of their reaction as I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no</font>

358
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,169
nukes right it's strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't it like I</font>

359
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,350
remember an incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of a</font>

360
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,089
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago where we invaded a</font>

361
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:30,719
country because they had weapons of mass

362
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:33,570
destruction and then like<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoa what do</font>

363
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,220
you mean that there is no nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

364
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,159
you know what's interesting about that

365
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,230
story is one of the huge parts of

366
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,720
evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was given was by a guy</font>

367
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:46,020
called Hans Blix does anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who</font>

368
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,770
Hans Blix is yeah he's the nuclear

369
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,240
weapons inspector who told them yo they

370
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,740
can make uranium they can make a bomb

371
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,230
they've got the infrastructure they

372
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,240
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a look right it's the same</font>

373
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">story that was used I'm very very</font>

374
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,919
interesting

375
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:06,949
so us Brits Germans we work this all out

376
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:11,450
right you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know surrender happens however</font>

377
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:13,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the u.s. is still at war with Japan so</font>

378
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">World War two is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still kicking off it's</font>

379
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,580
just not in our backyard anymore right

380
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:23,090
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting story of you</font>

381
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:28,699
bout two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fucking amazing</font>

382
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:30,559
story hugely interesting but let's I

383
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,799
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the story interesting because</font>

384
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,809
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of the implications</font>

385
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:40,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">the context is still pretty hard</font>

386
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:44,379
harrowing so who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows why we were able</font>

387
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:48,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hammer the the German Navy so hard</font>

388
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:52,340
yay infosec again right we broke enigma

389
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:55,159
so we pretty much broke the back of the

390
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,080
Germans naval systems and you two three

391
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,899
four was the biggest new boat that they

392
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,110
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is has didn't have too</font>

393
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:05,090
many sailors left a good way of sinking

394
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,750
them pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much stops them from being</font>

395
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,309
useful right so there's a rookie captain

396
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,580
that they give to this and it's u-boat

397
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,139
two three four so towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

398
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,990
Warriors we discussed the Enigma was a

399
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,820
huge player right so the only way that

400
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:23,330
Germany and Japan were able to

401
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,879
communicate securely was to send and

402
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,139
secure a such a relative term right but

403
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,390
the only way that they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate</font>

404
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,270
was to send you boats to each other

405
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,409
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's how they were that's how</font>

406
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,080
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were communicating they were</font>

407
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:38,149
putting like officers on boats and

408
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,210
sending them and then we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

409
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:45,770
bomb them on the way so you two three

410
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:50,179
four two<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese ambassadors make it to</font>

411
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:51,470
Germany and Germany's Germany's history

412
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,270
is written in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the books already right</font>

413
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,710
it's coming Hitler knows it's here and

414
00:19:53,270 --> 00:20:00,080
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make an argument that if the war</font>

415
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,840
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to succeed it needs to be the flag</font>

416
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,770
bearer right whatever Germany can assist

417
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,139
Japan it needs to do it now and Japan

418
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,908
will continue on fighting it's a very

419
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">desperate act from Japan because</font>

420
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:16,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Japan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where were in no winning streak at</font>

421
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:19,009
this point either bizarrely hitter

422
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,369
agrees with them and what he does is he

423
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:25,129
takes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 3 4 which is a battle class</font>

424
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:27,918
you vote under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sea boat as they like</font>

425
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:29,719
to call them right they strip it and

426
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,090
they turn it into a cargo vessel and

427
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,909
then what they do is they put basically

428
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:37,879
Hitler's treasure trove of evil shit in

429
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:42,470
the submarine it's got spy planes new

430
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:46,248
weapons and all of the Germans nuclear

431
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,479
project which was some u-235 we still

432
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:51,019
needed to be enriched but it was a good

433
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:53,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting point it was the plans their</font>

434
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:55,009
ideas I mean it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's not going</font>

435
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you a bum but it's a bloody good</font>

436
00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:02,149
start because up to this point Japan

437
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:03,440
didn't have anything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> off they sand</font>

438
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:05,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it's interesting we speak to that</font>

439
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,970
there's some videos of the Germans

440
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,369
sailors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were on the decks saying</font>

441
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,200
how weird this whole thing was these two

442
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,090
Japanese guys came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't speak a</font>

443
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,139
word of German and they started walking

444
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:20,149
around and writing u-235 on the boxes

445
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:21,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> German sailors had no idea what the</font>

446
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:24,408
cargo were they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thought these were</font>

447
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,499
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese guys right u-235 the</font>

448
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:29,179
boat you two three four right seriously

449
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:31,759
this is what they thought no<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

450
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:34,460
Japanese were writing u-235 or something

451
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,919
else so anyway they set off and off they

452
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,559
go and we break the we break the code

453
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:43,609
being sent out and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's</font>

454
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:45,859
on the bow but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure should know that</font>

455
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:47,809
it's important there's enough noise

456
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:51,978
going on that was sort of very very

457
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in it so we basically start</font>

458
00:21:51,979 --> 00:22:00,769
bombing its its path this<font color="#CCCCCC"> boats good to</font>

459
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:04,309
about 300 feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the bombing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was so</font>

460
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:08,059
severe that they took the boat to 600<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

461
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:10,428
far far beyond what it was supposed to

462
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">do I mean a depth charge anywhere near</font>

463
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,809
that could have easily sank them and

464
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:16,249
there is reports that this is not the

465
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">only shipment in uranium that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

466
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:19,970
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sent to Japan you know</font>

467
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:21,649
there is belief that some uranium is

468
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,679
still in broken u-boats at the bottom of

469
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:28,279
certain seas but them so if they

470
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:31,850
and the Boatwright bombing away you know

471
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:34,730
the Germans survive an onslaught like

472
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:38,689
you wouldn't believe they finally outrun

473
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,149
the Allies they surface up they get

474
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,480
reception to to get their signals to get

475
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:48,649
their commands and they hear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hitler</font>

476
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now dead and now the Third Reich has</font>

477
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:53,090
surrendered unconditionally you are to

478
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:55,519
raise a black flag upon your mast and

479
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:01,549
you are to sail to your nearest allied

480
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,960
fleet and surrender and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

481
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:04,759
commander of the u-boat doesn't really

482
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,549
have a choice right if he ignores those

483
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:10,179
commands he is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pirate right and he</font>

484
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:12,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be he'll be hung and down as such</font>

485
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:16,159
which is really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

486
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,559
because they happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese</font>

487
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,159
guys on their boat who haven't

488
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,470
surrendered who are still at war with

489
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,470
America and the only vessels in the area

490
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,749
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Canadian vessel in an American</font>

491
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:32,299
vessel the Germans have decided that

492
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">they want to for some reason surrender</font>

493
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the Americans not the Canadians no</font>

494
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,200
idea why they give bad signal

495
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,299
intelligence to the Canadians and head

496
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,179
out to meet the Americans the problem is

497
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:45,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these two guys on board that</font>

498
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,610
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto a ship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full of allies when</font>

499
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">they started and became prisoners</font>

500
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,178
straight afterwards right well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns</font>

501
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,139
out these two ambassadors also happen to

502
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:58,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a little bit about submarines so</font>

503
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:00,918
the u-boat commander was a little bit

504
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,749
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and he locked them</font>

505
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:05,029
in their rooms relieved them of their

506
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:06,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">weapons blah blah blah blah blah they</font>

507
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,389
didn't hear from them for a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

508
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours went into check and spry surprise</font>

509
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:14,360
they've committed suicide wrote notes

510
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:17,059
blah blah blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay sad tale</font>

511
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,189
and the wife of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ambassador's</font>

512
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:21,168
said that she believes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> her husband</font>

513
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,259
could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sank the ship were decided</font>

514
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:25,879
that to save everyone's life basically

515
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,139
that he would just take his own because

516
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:30,769
he was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be taken by the</font>

517
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:32,658
Americans so anyway the boat comes along

518
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,809
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> surrounded themselves through a</font>

519
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:38,179
u.s. fleet small little ship they put it

520
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:40,369
under guns they bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

521
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:42,619
stock only<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it pulls and you realize</font>

522
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:45,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's the equivalent of like a</font>

523
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:48,830
chihuahua shouting down a rope viola

524
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,539
it's a tiny little bow a big boat and

525
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,070
it's like any day the week and twice on

526
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:55,580
Sunday the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germans were always going to</font>

527
00:24:52,070 --> 00:25:01,460
win this argument apart from this day so

528
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:02,990
the hand the boat over and this is when

529
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,240
they start to look through the the

530
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,100
itinerary and work out that actually

531
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,659
what is aboard this boat was slightly

532
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,580
interesting uranium is quite a rare

533
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:11,899
property it wasn't enough to build a

534
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,019
bomb but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had enough uranium in</font>

535
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:18,110
there that was pretty cool so the

536
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:21,259
manhattan project turned up and took the

537
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:23,479
uranium and then threw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into their</font>

538
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:26,360
reactor and turned it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into uranium 238</font>

539
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:31,789
and that made part of the bomb that they

540
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:34,580
dropped on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hiroshima so history is she</font>

541
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:36,379
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cruel sense of irony</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it yes it</font>

542
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:41,059
got him retched and delivered by the

543
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:44,658
Americans he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very cruel sense of</font>

544
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:46,970
irony right it's not enough to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

545
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,830
bomb but it's it's a sizable amount you

546
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no idea with what care they truck</font>

547
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,869
taught that treated this uranium they

548
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,029
got the uranium and threw it in the pile

549
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:58,309
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the uranium right it</font>

550
00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:01,669
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and a little bit of the ball</font>

551
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:05,119
here is the german park whoo so yeah

552
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:07,519
they they took something like 400 pounds

553
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,649
and turned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into 50 50 grams so I mean</font>

554
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,789
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of attrition rate you're</font>

looking at him this is little boy<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

556
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:17,509
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the weapons it's a bit strange</font>

557
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,600
that call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> little boy right it doesn't</font>

558
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:23,179

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Janet</font>

563

this is a this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad boy right you</font>

564
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,540
don't want to mess around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this one</font>

565
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,390
this is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gadget</font>

566
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:44,139
this is the test piece this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite</font>

567
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,640
funny this story as well right so about

568
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,160
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> they took them to get this</font>

569
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,530
far and finally they've made enough

570
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,020
plutonium and uranium they can they've

571
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:56,320
got enough to spare right to blow up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

572
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:59,860
test piece so they're pretty sure that

573
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,810
they're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that little boy is</font>

574
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,709

575
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:08,110
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> its inefficient but it will work but</font>

576
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,720
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too sure how this which is</font>

577
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:14,320
an implosion method will work so there

578
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,490
goes to the desert and well they have a

579
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,439
little bit of problems along the way

580
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,140
right so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring out this great big</font>

581
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,420
bomb took four days they're constructing

582
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,610
it craning it up threw out in that Alma

<font color="#CCCCCC">Gordo which is called death valley by</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">path without any water you'll die they</font>

587
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:37,270
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place to start</font>

588
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,950
project Trinity which is our maguro

589
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,360
where they build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gadget so anyway they</font>

590
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,890
take the gadget up they start building

591
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,629
it let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the plutonium core they</font>

592
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:50,200
they go to put it in the gadget and it

593
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,530
doesn't fit right after six<font color="#E5E5E5"> years the</font>

594
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:58,030
plutonium core does not fit in the bomb

595
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:59,560
dunk shit Oppenheimer loses his shit

596
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,960
this guy's been pretty cool all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

597
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">through it but he's at this point where</font>

598
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,450
it's like whoa for years we've been

599
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,590
building this for this long and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't fit science</font>

601
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,320
right what they forgot was that the case

602
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:19,899
had been out in the Sun for four days

603
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,939
and that the heat in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun and</font>

604
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,100
expected in expanded the metal

605
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,380
components of the device and all I

606
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,389
needed to do was leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plutonium</font>

607
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,700
core out for a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours to get up</font>

608
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:33,670
to similar temperature<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a drop back in</font>

609
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,850
but just just for a couple of minutes

610
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">boy did they think they fucked up</font>

611
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,649
you can imagine how<font color="#CCCCCC"> nervous she would be</font>

612
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,180
late two billion dollars later<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font>

613
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,840
better plutonium that doesn't for him

614
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:52,300
but it did in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab nor we didn't</font>

615
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:54,399
knock over your web application so the

616
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,730
most infamous picture we probably see

617
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:01,000
throughout history this clinical moment

618
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:05,590
that changes changes everything for

619
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,390
really they had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea i say to you</font>

620
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">that had no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what would happen</font>

621
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,940
they took bats right so you know the

622
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,590
sweepstake where if someone's pregnant

623
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,170
in the office you belt on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the baby's</font>

624
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:19,659
weight that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what they did here</font>

625
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:22,300
like hey when it goes off how many

626
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,760
kilotons well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take 2 i'm going</font>

627
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,560
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take 13 i'm</font>

628
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,210
going to take 11 these are the

629
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,240
scientists that building this shit they

630
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:34,900
had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea right they just knew it's</font>

631
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be a big band right okay they were</font>

632
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,350
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit right so the they had</font>

633
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:43,540
spectators like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wesley 20-month 200</font>

634
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:46,870
miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is how far you can</font>

635
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,030
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and their advice was when</font>

636
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,729
the detonation goes off lay on your

637
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:55,290
belly with your feet towards the

638
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:58,270
explosion right and you'll be okay

639
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:00,670
thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really needed you</font>

640
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,430
to work that shit out from me<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

641
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,080
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edward Teller I'll talk about in</font>

642
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,570
a little bit do any of you know who had

643
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,840
with terrorists yeah he's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

644
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,879
harbinger of death so he'd managed to

645
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,780
scare the shit he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the he was</font>

646
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:20,140
a Greek<font color="#E5E5E5"> that went to America a fantastic</font>

647
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,510
physicist very very egocentric though he

648
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,550
he managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up a bet he managed to</font>

649
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,440
basically scare the whole entire camp

650
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,379
that there was a possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

651
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,840
nuclear weapon was going to ignite the

652
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">atmosphere right which you can imagine</font>

653
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,000
if you're a military<font color="#E5E5E5"> person that's</font>

654
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,280
probably slightly worrying to hear I

655
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,300
mean for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other person is a little</font>

656
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,690
bit concerning as well so general<font color="#E5E5E5"> groves</font>

657
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,909
walks into the office speaks Oppenheimer

658
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,300
shouts Oppenheimer<font color="#E5E5E5"> open a master's all</font>

659
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,490
know we've we've

660
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,610
crunch the numbers Edwards got it wrong

661
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,400
okay it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a one in three million</font>

662
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:01,340
right and any chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could pull that</font>

663
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">door to for you there's a one in three</font>

664
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:07,100
million chance that the wicked ignite

665
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,770
knee atmosphere you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine as a</font>

666
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,959
general it's that one that kind of house

667
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,790
you panicked right so you managed to

668
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,020
convince the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole office that we're</font>

669
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna blow this up and we're going to</font>

670
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose the atmosphere we're glad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report</font>

671
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,270
that Edward Teller was wrong right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

672
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,610
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they did they still</font>

673
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,950
fucking turned it on right right well

674
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:28,209
you know we're not going to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

675
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,980
million of them on it's okay right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

676
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,480
yeah they blow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this is probably one</font>

677
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,990
of the most infamous quotes that you'll

678
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,400
ever find from Oppenheimer Oppenheimer

679
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:45,080
is a complex character passionately

680
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:48,950
believed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> atomic weapon adamantly</font>

681
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,889
against thermonuclear I imagine that

682
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,170
once you once you build a war a war

683
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,420
stopper you probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

684
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:59,210
involved in building too many more we

685
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:03,350
have a quiver bernheimer cannot remember

686
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:05,960
his name in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK who once we build our</font>

687
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:09,050
weapon in project equinox burnt all his

688
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,940
papers he didn't hebert all his papers

689
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,470
his journals everything he didn't want

690
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be remembered in life as someone who</font>

691
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,990
built the nuclear weapon so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

692
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,840
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tough cookie to carry I imagine but</font>

693
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,060
as I say America is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still at war with</font>

694
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,740
Japan who quite clearly doesn't have a

695
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,830
nuclear project because you've just

696
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,080
enriched their uranium right so you kind

697
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:33,860
of ahead of the game you know that it's

698
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,870
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour so there's a few logistic</font>

699
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,449
problems in dropping a nuclear weapon

700
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:42,080
right like you can't just turn up you

701
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:43,700
can't send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it via DHL right you know the</font>

702
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">Royal Mail is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deliver this</font>

703
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:55,400
for you yeah we need a signature for

704
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:57,290
that ok so they had to they had to

705
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,760
practice flying planes these guys had no

706
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:02,480
idea what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were doing until later on</font>

707
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,890
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most amazing story ever see</font>

708
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,710
this guy here

709
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,840
right he found out he was going to do

710
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first bomb run for the nuclear</font>

711
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,669
weapon and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought this plane is</font>

712
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the most famous plane in</font>

713
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:22,340
history and he was sort of right so he

714
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:26,320
named after his mother Enola Gay so

715
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:29,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">history now records that gay bombed</font>

716
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,480
Hiroshima but you know interestingly

717
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,250
enough so they practice this run they go

718
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,930
and do it you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we sneak speak</font>

719
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,760
about Snowden we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about why</font>

720
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,490
didn't he use official channels right

721
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,110
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a little segue for you why</font>

722
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,870
didn't why didn't he go and speak to

723
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:51,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">people about what he discovered you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

724
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:55,600
here's an example of people involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

725
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Manhattan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Project writing saying</font>

726
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,290
we've seen the demonstration of the

727
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:06,260
weapon you cannot drop this on Japan

728
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:09,889
right there have no nuclear project you

729
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,889
cannot do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this you need to set up a</font>

730
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:16,250
demonstration and show them you cannot

731
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:19,609
drop this on people this is the petition

732
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,989
that they set up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicago this is the</font>

733
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:23,360
petition then they started for less at

734
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:24,560
Los Alamos that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oppenheimer himself</font>

735
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,740
stopped from being distributed

throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the camp this is</font>

739
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:38,679
physicists as they like to call them was

740
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,310
they were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a debate where</font>

741
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,770
they were going to have a debate

742
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,830
basically with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> President's Men</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

743
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:49,759
dropping the weapon and don't let

744
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:52,639
history confuse the selection of their

745
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,790
bombing targets they specifically chose

746
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,100
civilian areas to drop their bombs if

747
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,680
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where both bombs were</font>

748
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,589
dropped there were military targets that

749
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,339
they completely missed in in the choice

750
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:10,430
to bomb down the center of<font color="#CCCCCC"> town another</font>

751
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:13,310
interesting fact for you Hiroshima<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

752
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:15,560
Nagasaki both were not bombed by

753
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,480
conventional weapons for a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

754
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,759
prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them being bombed</font>

755
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,800
because what they needed was a city

756
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,710
intact so that they could gauge the

757
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,940
damage so you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there if you</font>

758
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,470
were in Hiroshima and thinking wow

759
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,700
everyone else had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> bombed and we're</font>

760
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:33,589
saw a blast yeah maybe not but like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

761
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,240
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the official channels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

762
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,070
quite clearly didn't work right these

763
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,819
are the people that built it saying we

764
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:42,650
can't do it Hiroshima and Nagasaki this

765
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,920
is the case by the way of the black box

766
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,630
right anything anything we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

767
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,020
build stuff up whatever they build those

768
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:54,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">arches out right that's the ship they</font>

769
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:58,640
send they send a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Manhattan</font>

770
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,340
scientists away to look at the Nagasaki

771
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,440
and Hiroshima none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are pretty</font>

772
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,570
much the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards right it's</font>

773
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,010
quite hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their head around when</font>

774
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,200
we sit there and we laugh about nuclear

775
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,460
weapons / now you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a girl</font>

776
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,470
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't have any more eyes right</font>

777
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,960
there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge amount of damage</font>

778
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,339
done on this Japan<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have a nuclear</font>

779
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,060
project Japan were pretty close to

780
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:25,070
surrender it's a lot of debate that this

781
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:28,160
weapon was dropped a lot more to scare

782
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:31,369
the Soviets than it was to beat the

783
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:35,629
Japanese and you can sort of see this

784
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:37,040
later on so Russian intelligence we

785
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,750
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoken about a Russians is not</font>

786
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,080
secure it's not infants not cyber

787
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:45,980
without the Russians right so let's do

788
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,490
the Russians bear so the Americans get a

789
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:51,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">game changer a weapon the Americans drop</font>

790
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:54,020
it on a country that doesn't have any

791
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:57,170
weapons and another country without any

792
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:00,320
weapons<font color="#E5E5E5"> look sitting goes holy shit</font>

793
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:02,840
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that to us right so</font>

794
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Starling decides we might want to get</font>

795
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,710
involved in this nuclear research

796
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,130
project ship right<font color="#CCCCCC"> no what we've tried</font>

797
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,330
no no we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it no we tried</font>

798
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:15,380
know if you don't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

799
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:20,810
kill you and trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> me he killed a lot of</font>

800
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:25,869
people right this is this by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way IP</font>

801
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:28,160
theft IP theft plus plus plus right

802
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,619
surprise surprise Russians are pretty

803
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,899
known as a land army

804
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:35,150
I they like to march and take over ship

805
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,930
right don't like to fly in we just walk

806
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,759
right we're doing it so the Russians had

807
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,609
planes but they didn't have any bombers

808
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:45,529
and a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the it's pretty much</font>

809
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:47,598
back to the same again we can't DHL it

810
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,279
so what we're going to do well we're

811
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,740
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a bomber so we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font>

812
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:56,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">build a bomb and the bomber ya nah fuck</font>

813
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:59,359
that the Americans build it in Mexico

814
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:01,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">right yeah ok send an agent with a</font>

815
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,848
suitcase full of cash to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the factory and</font>

816
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:07,999
bribe someone to give you the plants and

817
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:10,640
that's exactly what happened so this is

818
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:13,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the to pull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off and this is the flying</font>

819
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,180
fortress which is an exact carbon copy

820
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:19,490
cuz outsourcing they paid the Mexican

821
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,288
and they got the money make me like they

822
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,410
didn't give a shit they do and then yeah

823
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:25,609
sure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anecdote ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

824
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think i've ever heard a better</font>

825
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:30,470
anecdote than this one right now so the

826
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:34,309
reverse engineer looks at the American

827
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:36,680
Boeing plant and says yeah we can make

828
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:39,829
this but we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make some improvements</font>

829
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:43,220
here here and here starling says no I

830
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:45,739
want an exact copy now<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes in life</font>

831
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,109
people say stuff without thinking right

832
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:50,509
and get to get to tell the consequences

833
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,970
and this is one of them so Starling says

834
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:55,460
the reverse engineer no I want you to

835
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">build an exact copy the reverse engineer</font>

836
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:02,799
says do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want us to paint the stars</font>

837
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:05,380
on it too and then styling walked off

838
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:07,670
right and the guy lives to tell the tale

839
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,079
which is surprising because there's a

840
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people that died for a lot less</font>

841
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:14,599
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shit right like whoa dude if</font>

842
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:18,079
you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet like he's like a legend in</font>

843
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:23,450
my book right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this is this is how</font>

844
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,759
we get into trouble right so anyway

845
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:31,430
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to pull off is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carbon</font>

846
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:36,109
copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the of the Americans sin</font>

847
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:39,348
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Manhattan Project the Russians the</font>

848
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:41,150
whole Russian weapon system basically

849
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">their first you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's called</font>

850
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:48,470
read Joe is a

851
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:51,049
literally a photocopy Klaus Fuchs gave

852
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:54,259
the Russians the plans from the

853
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:57,050
Manhattan Project so talk a little bit

854
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,710
about Klaus Fuchs what he he was part of

855
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">our project when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd got involved in</font>

856
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:05,030
the nuclear game Pratt before the

857
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,360
Americans when the Americans decided to

858
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:11,150
get involved they said why don't we

859
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:14,060

00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:21,650
supplying it to the Russians as well so

885
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,600

suitcase

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,470
gives over the amount of stuff and then

902
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,569
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of his life has radiation</font>

903
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:09,919
burns the side of his belly he'd throw

904
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:11,119
he'd flown uranium-235 235 strapped to

905
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,710
the side of his belly on a commercial

906
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:19,720
flight had no idea whatsoever right so

907
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:22,430
if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data loss you know I</font>

908
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,290
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> gave a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't give a lot of</font>

909
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">data right you know some reports and</font>

910
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,940
some files but the implications are

911
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:32,000
massive you know if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the data</font>

912
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,260
that Snowden leaked yeah there's a lot

913
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it right these are just some guests</font>

914
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,880
emotes that's the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get</font>

915
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:39,259
because even general alexander hasn't

916
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,119
off fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> clue what this guy took</font>

917
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:46,850
right these<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't been updated for a</font>

918
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,390
while but yeah you can imagine there's a

919
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:51,740
lot of day been flowing about reasoning

920
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,420
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all come from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so when</font>

921
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,930
the Russians drop their set off their

922
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,800
first nuclear weapons sort the Americans

923
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,319
the Americans thought they were going to

924
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,119
have 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> years monopoly right that's what</font>

925
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,540
they thought we have this game-changing

926
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:10,850
weapon we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years to cement our</font>

927
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:13,460
monopoly within four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years Russia sets</font>

928
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:16,460
off their first nuclear weapon right and

929
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:19,280
it kind of scares the shit out of the

930
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,260
Americans begins the McCarthyism trials

931
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,310
and stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but when that</font>

932
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:28,700
incident happens what starts is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cold</font>

933
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">War right this is what becomes which</font>

934
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:34,009
shapes our lives today quite

935
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:35,930
predominantly right I mean we like to

936
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:38,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that we don't we're not in a</font>

937
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,919
cold war but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel much</font>

938
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:40,970
different than it did 20 years ago right

939
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,340
I mean it's there's still a lot of

940
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:47,959
bullshit going on McCarthyism if if we

941
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,960
knew history batter we'd have called

942
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,609
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hoover ism right that that's you</font>

943
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:58,820
know if McCarthyism ripped America apart

944
00:43:54,609 --> 00:44:03,170
right so anyone who's suspected of being

945
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">an American AKA communist was basically</font>

946
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,480
blackballed which is a bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

947
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Oppenheimer because basically</font>

948
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,079
Oppenheimer

949
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:15,719
an inspection would look like a

950
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,939
communist right his wife was a communist

951
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:20,309
his brother<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a communist his friends</font>

952
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:24,239
were a communist the FBI had been

953
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:26,519
tailing him from 1933 when they reviewed

954
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,199
this case see if when only any police

955
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:29,848
officer reviews your case you can hope

956
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,979
for this moment room where they're

957
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:35,279
wheeling a big trolley stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> two files</font>

958
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:37,468
and the person Luke saying goes it's

959
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:38,929
going to take a while and they say it's

960
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:42,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other four you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

961

<font color="#CCCCCC">right that's how big his fire was I</font>

962
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:45,989

965
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:55,769
fuckers were tapping the Oppenheimer's

<font color="#CCCCCC">lawyers office Oppenheimer had a case</font>

967
00:44:55,769 --> 00:45:02,399
review for security clearance and the

00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:05,219
quote on quote prosecution were given

969
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,419

00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:15,150
constitution anymore right I mean you

973
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:17,130
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need that right communism so</font>

974
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:21,349
McCarthyism happens my interest from

975
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:26,159
this comes from an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wrote</font>

976
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:29,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how hackers we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> experience a</font>

977
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:31,559
version of McCarthyism did if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

978
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:33,989
to silence someone you accuse them of

979
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:35,819
being a hacker right I mean you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

980
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:37,739
them in a jail cell for 5 years without

981
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:39,989
telephone calls you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ask</font>

982
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:42,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mitnick in the evening Capone got bail</font>

983
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:45,599
hearing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mitnick didn't you know</font>

984
00:45:42,749 --> 00:45:47,578
you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you know I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

985
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,529
fan of weed right but you know look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

986
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:53,640
what was done there that the whole list

987
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:55,890
goes on in these instances and the late

988
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,908
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron Swartz sorry the great</font>

989
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:01,558
orange thwarts lost his life for

990
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:06,179
checking out too many library books

991
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:07,859
right so you know McCarthyism is still

992
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:09,299
here is still the remnants we still have

993
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:10,679
a figure of it's still there so if

994
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're wondering where I came from my I</font>

995
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:14,069
spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time looking at McCarthyism</font>

996
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:16,709
and following where that went nuts

997
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:18,630
that's where I got to it from this is

998
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:20,129
Oppenheimer who even in today would

999
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">never get fucking security clearance</font>

1000
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,120
right this guy put it into a modern

1001
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">contact</font>

1002
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,710
this guy you were given security

1003
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,240

1004
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">with bin Laden that's basically what you</font>

1005
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,850
would be doing right I mean this guy had

1006
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:39,149
so many red flags it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> unbelievable I</font>

1007
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:41,100
mean and the reasoning your security

1008
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:44,070
clearance was literally a train ride

1009
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:47,509
with general groves and general groves

1010
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:51,930
asked him are you a communist no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1011
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:54,420
done that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it thank this spit and</font>

1012
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,700
sawdust cowboy wasn't having any of this

1013
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">lefty communist to look opiate are you a</font>

1014
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:05,629

1015
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:08,640
this is edward teller so you told the

1016
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:12,180
atomic weapon is a nasty piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1017
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:16,020
equipment right its tactical door it's a

1018
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:17,850
weapon<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can use practically what</font>

1019
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,320
they worked out is that they could use

1020
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:22,770
an atomic reaction to set off a

1021
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:25,170
thermonuclear reaction which is it's

1022
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,460
pretty shit right it's like a thousand

1023
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,710
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> more powerful than the most</font>

1024
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,180
powerful atomic weapon that you can

1025
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:34,650
think of there's absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> no tactical</font>

1026
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,049
benefit in using a thermonuclear weapon

1027
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:40,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically built a bomb they can nuke</font>

1028
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:43,700
Moscow that's it right it's there is

1029
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:48,660
nothing out when they demonstrated it a

1030
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:52,410
bikini<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bay they evaporated the island</font>

1031
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they tested it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on right let's just</font>

1032
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:59,009
get that into context they blew an

1033
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:01,410
island away gone no more not<font color="#CCCCCC"> no land</font>

1034
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:05,850
must gone that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> powerful this thing</font>

1035
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:07,920
is right a lot smaller far far<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1036
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:10,440
deadly Oppenheimer was very much against

1037
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,750
the thermonuclear weapon basically what

1038
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,030
you said was an surprise surprise right

1039
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,350
what you said was the only reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1040
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,300
Russians have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nuclear weapon is</font>

1041
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:20,670
because we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nuclear weapon and if</font>

1042
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">we build a thermonuclear weapon guess</font>

1043
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,260
what the Russians<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have a</font>

1044
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,480
thermonuclear weapon right they built

1045
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,610
one because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us if we do this they'll</font>

1046
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,640
build one because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and these</font>

1047
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:35,940
weapons have no tactical advantage they

1048
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,259
will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> end the world and it was his</font>

1049
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,720
opposition again

1050
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,550
the thermonuclear weapon which inspired

1051
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,040
his hearing that got him to lose his

1052
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:46,560
security clearance the guy that gave a

1053
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,230
meritorious nuclear project was deemed

1054
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:54,720
unsafe to know about the nuclear project

1055
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:56,610
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you work that shit all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right with</font>

1056
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,140
you know it's kind of strange because we

1057
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,040
have this insecurity all the time the

1058
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,660
shit that they said they weren't going

1059
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do they did because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guess what</font>

1060
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,770
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russians got their</font>

1061
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,970
thermonuclear made a stammer new Russia

1062
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:08,400
made its dominique not so long

1063
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:11,700
afterwards well here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go with the</font>

1064
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,990
security shirt right so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shit</font>

1065
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,580
they said they weren't doing they're

1066
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:18,089
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing that</font>

1067
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:20,250
cyber walk right stiver cyber if you

1068
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:23,130
wonder in these are people in uniforms

1069
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:25,320
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question I've asked everyone why</font>

1070
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:28,230
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drone operators where flight</font>

1071
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,090
suits right there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in that</font>

1072
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:32,910
logic that just doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me</font>

1073
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:38,070
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that the</font>

1074
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:40,980
Flay is in flat retina mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

1075
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:43,740
cyber war and we said this for a long

1076
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:48,020
time right like here is something that

1077
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:52,379
happened in 1952 replaying out in 2014

1078
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:56,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bmd which is the German equivalent</font>

1079
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:58,410
of the NSA went back to the Bundestag

1080
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:02,069
which is the German equivalent of the

1081
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:05,220
government and said we need 300 million

1082
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:08,100
euros to compete against the NSA in the

1083
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:11,910
exploit purchasing business they

1084
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:15,060
literally like we need more money to<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

1085
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,770
more cyber weapons because the Americans

1086
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,650
have got it and they start at a cottage

1087
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:23,190
industry firstly I think they need

1088
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:26,790
another zero but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the beginning</font>

1089
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:28,410
right we're now you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

1090
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,330
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about bad guys buying zero</font>

1091
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:32,310
days right they've gone be out priced in

1092
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:35,360
the market by the the industrial

1093
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:37,650
military complex when it balls nanima so

1094
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,240
yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already starting to happen</font>

1095
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,890
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is just a country that</font>

1096
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,629
went on record with it and when God

1097
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:47,339
knows who else is starting up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game</font>

1098
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,470
at some point you have to have a Snowden

1099
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,619
comment I'm kind of grateful for Snowden

1100
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,269
because it means i have to stop do

1101
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">sunzu comments and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can move to Snowden</font>

1102
00:50:52,269 --> 00:51:00,058
comments now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is good right but</font>

1103
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:02,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically he said you know we have our</font>

1104
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:06,279
computer scientists have their atomic

1105
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:10,049
bomb moment and we do right wee<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit by</font>

1106
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:13,240
piece do things as researchers the scene

1107
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:15,160
without weight them seem so important

1108
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,669
and when they're connected into bigger

1109
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,618
things start to become more important

1110
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:23,349
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this clear metadata kills</font>

1111
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:25,569
right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simplest that right</font>

1112
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:27,670
when they launched their attacks on bin

1113
00:51:25,569 --> 00:51:29,259
Laden it was purely metadata that they

1114
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">went on they were right this time</font>

1115
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:34,480
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people in weddings in</font>

1116
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:38,349
Pakistan where they were wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1117
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,089
and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say the metadata oh we</font>

1118
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:43,210
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not collecting content data</font>

1119
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:45,490
we're collecting metadata yeah people

1120
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:48,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">died on that shit right this is not just</font>

1121
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:49,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I mean we teaches a community we</font>

1122
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:53,200
teach security but we have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1123
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:56,289
concept of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implications of where we</font>

1124
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,308
go such like Gil motto you know that's

1125
00:51:56,289 --> 00:52:04,029
that's the security industry that broke

1126
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:05,819
sim cards yay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we screwed</font>

1127
00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:12,099
the telecommunications industry over

1128
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:13,799
when you know if we look at if we look

1129
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:16,989
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies they were targeted</font>

1130
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:20,980
these were American companies targeted

1131
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:22,539
by an American agency what sure what

1132
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:27,039
look do you think that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1133
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:30,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">have when Google when PayPal are</font>

1134
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:33,369

1135
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:35,380
some worries right this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> shitty</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">polar bears voting for lacks controls</font>

turn around and get these people say no

1174
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:20,119
case you know but what we find is the

1175
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,369
government's will turn for these

1176
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies to give expert opinion on the</font>

1177
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:28,250
situation so you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak to</font>

1178
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">rathian about how safe the world is and</font>

1180
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:37,190
probably going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more bombs</font>

1181
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:42,609
right how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you know where this</font>

1182
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:45,079
quote is from war is peace it says I

1183
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:47,029
yeah it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit screwed up with</font>

1184
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:50,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse pieces there is</font>

1185
00:54:47,029 --> 00:54:52,880
a 1984 reference if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't read</font>

1186
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,480
1984 don't mistake it for an operational

1187
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,299
manual if you have read it read it again

1188
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">today with today's context right read it</font>

1189
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:03,529
today again with what's happening and

1190
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,019
it's a very scary read i read it just

1191
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:08,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">before I did this talk a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

1192
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:11,149
ready before but it was a little bit

1193
00:55:08,299 --> 00:55:12,740
more hard-hitting when I'm like shit it

1194
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,200
would be a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did it right</font>

1195
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,439
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff in 1984 is a little</font>

1196
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,919
bit less horrible than I was

1197
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,020
so war is peace I mean we have a system

1198
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,770
that is continually designing to I mean

1199
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:28,790
it's the European Way right European Way

1200
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:31,589
is war war war that's all we've done

1201
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:33,180
this is general Alexander this is

1202
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:35,759
general Alexander lightning to his

1203
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:40,910
bosses and this is general Alexander

1204
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:43,170
lying towards a black hat right so yeah

1205
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:45,149
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away with not telling the</font>

1206
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:49,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">truth as long as you have stripes and</font>

1207
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:52,260
stars right this is growing if you're

1208
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:56,040
wondering he's the the military guy he

1209
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:58,050
build the Pentagon<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's pretty cool can</font>

1210
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,569
be a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ass but no general</font>

1211
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:03,030
Alexander right so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do some</font>

1212
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:06,930
conclusions a lot of this is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1213
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:09,810
problem is is we seem to have speaking

1214
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:11,609
to engineers security minds about it and

1215
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:14,640
your freedom is is something as simple

1216
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:16,290
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing the two plus two equals four</font>

1217
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,440
that's what freedom actually ultimately

1218
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:22,230
is right and a lot of what we're going

1219
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,480
on now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have like asymmetric</font>

1220
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:27,150
information where people take control of

1221
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,530
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I able to we're not able to</font>

1222
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">share I've said this a number of times</font>

1223
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the whole NSA leaks its people</font>

1224
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,990
bang on as though Snowden you know it

1225
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,020
snowed in spied on people's emails you

1226
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:42,839
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know it was if light</font>

1227
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,819
if the truth screws your operations up

1228
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:48,119
maybe your operations are a little bit

1229
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:49,740
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with right but freedom is</font>

1230
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:51,450
to know that two plus two equals four

1231
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,209
and it's a freedom that we're losing

1232
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:57,509
massively censorship so on and so forth

1233
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:59,849
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wonder if a lot of the way how</font>

1234
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:01,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">many of you read brave new world you</font>

1235
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:05,910
know all I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is net neutrality</font>

1236
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:08,430
right I mean if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at what</font>

1237
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:10,618
damage you can do if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the PS PSN</font>

1238
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:12,540
off on the PlayStation Network off on on

1239
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,640
Christmas Day right you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can probably</font>

1240
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:16,290
start riots well as if we turn all the

1241
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,569
netflix off in a world and laugh and

1242
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:22,170
joke but the very means that we use for

1243
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:24,509
communication is is greatly being

1244
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:27,060
affected with you know and it's like

1245
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:28,660
sorry my right we are a lot like

1246
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:31,420
physicists

1247
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,970
if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not kept that the thing is is</font>

1248
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:36,280
that people are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask us how</font>

1249
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:38,919
to use our research very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer you</font>

1250
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:41,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">know to build nuclear weapons doesn't</font>

1251
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:45,099
require nuclear physicists anymore right

1252
00:57:41,049 --> 00:57:46,990
it requires a factory and we will get to

1253
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:50,559
this point in security offensive

1254
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:52,629
security where does not require security

1255
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,809
consultants talking about ethics<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1256
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:58,569
morals to<font color="#CCCCCC"> launch an attack against any</font>

1257
00:57:55,809 --> 00:58:01,150
one of us I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave you with</font>

1258
00:57:58,569 --> 00:58:02,829
hopefully with this quote those who can

1259
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,289
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you believe in absurdities can make</font>

1260
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:07,960
you commit atrocities I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

1261
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:12,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">is pretty relevant where we are all in</font>

1262
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:14,380
all so not being said I am a little bit
