got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a phone call about a week later I'm</font>

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the train and when going to see them</font>

112
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,739
was I was Detective Inspector<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stuart</font>

113
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,230
Garrick he's now actually you know one

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my supervisors in scale as a special</font>

many for the first time the first thing

118
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,610
you said to me was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to really</font>

have topped on what he means by that but

123
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,669
that didn't make sense to me at the time

124
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,740
but we probably recall that and this is

125
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,050
alluded to by while steve armstrong

126

you lots of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> now essentially is</font>

188
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,900
being felt like an interview in fairness

189
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,150
I guess that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably what it was I</font>

190
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,390
could be for an interview but I guess I

191
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:36,590
did okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I week later they hurry</font>

195
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,150
fight quite a quite a quite a bit of

196
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,829
interesting stuff all nervous which the

197
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,020
police actually missed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was my</font>

198
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,640
my primary focus of course was to try

199
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,490
and find something which which which the

200
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,140
police<font color="#CCCCCC"> hammer and in fact they actually</font>

said to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I the party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

forensic analysis on the driver

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">interplay certainly don't find anything</font>

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,080
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't found an investor charge</font>

205
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,130
is a challenge and sites i did find

206
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,300
stuff for their different<font color="#E5E5E5"> five and a</font>

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,700
fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been system bonding</font>

210
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,230
common knowledge to them to most people

211
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,990
in forensics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going back a while</font>

212
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,100
it was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know since a while ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,650
more the quants<font color="#E5E5E5"> are common knowledge</font>

217
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,100
where when your machine goes to put a

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,880
restore point plus the place where it's

219
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,590
stored<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so you know</font>

220
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,260
by a battery system when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use of his</font>

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,070
back to a previous pointed you go back

<font color="#E5E5E5">to system restore point but those system</font>

restore point it could be mounted you

227
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,800
know like like an image within their own

228
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,540
right that's what I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> I amounted were</font>

229
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,520
allowed to basically went through a

230
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,079
bunch of than theirs maybe the horse

231
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,300
pulling up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system restore points</font>

232
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,970
on icon and it feels and I went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

233
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,420
America all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them as a result</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

find some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff some internet cookies</font>

235
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found websites that have been</font>

236
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:12,300
visited they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't been spotted before</font>

237
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:15,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably had some encrypted files as</font>

238
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,849
well which which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never got encrypted</font>

239
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,420
decrypted and if we try that didn't work

240
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,680
out I've I've come direct to the source

241
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's what they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't work</font>

242
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,959
out either family<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've had a</font>

243
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,719
bit cooler wallet that was interesting

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and which was the police have available</font>

245
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is though so</font>

246
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,839
i extracted it and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all to my</font>

247
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,610
system started least thinking about the

248
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,400
liquid network and waited and then I saw

249
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know</font>

250
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,420
bitcoins going into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin wallet</font>

251
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,100
and it occurred to me a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

252
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,780
occurred to me the first one occurred to

253
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,660
me the police<font color="#CCCCCC"> and founder strikes wasn't</font>

254
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,949
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report so he knows there the</font>

255
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,110
second thing occurred to me was the

256
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,400
staffer hadn't told the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police that he</font>

257
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,040
had a Bitcoin wallet which meant that

258
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,220
nobody at that point you that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

259
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin wallet pot for me right and</font>

260
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,090
so so you know how Bitcoin works<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

261
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,140
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're when you're when</font>

262
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,120
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pressure sort</font>

263
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,080
of synchronous synchronizing and so

264
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,000
you're not actually seeing things in

265
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,040
real time you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Hollywood okay</font>

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,620
so so looking at the big ones at one

267
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,420
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it dawns on me there's</font>

268
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,220
not bitcoins in there at today's market

269
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,810
value for me to get a small extension on

270
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,940
my house and her and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of any</font>

271
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,040
time discussing my wife and harness that

272
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,920
seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were more abiding</font>

273
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,209
citizens<font color="#E5E5E5"> that course I cooking today I</font>

274
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,990
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone down that path as he</font>

275
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,790
transpired as ty Stan elapsed and they

276
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be what it starts to come to date</font>

277
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:48,660
with Layton we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it the</font>

278
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:51,220
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> coin like the the bitcoins were God</font>

279
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,270
transferred into another account and

280
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,400
they disappeared from that particular

281
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,170
way so that temptation was removed from

282
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,810
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> only half dealer to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too much</font>

283
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:02,920
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah that's right well</font>

284
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,329
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one other person in this room</font>

285
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that knows that I couldn't have gotten</font>

286
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,630
his bigoted<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ron's there are but this</font>

287
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:12,790
disturbs can substantiate<font color="#CCCCCC"> our story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

288
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,180
I did you know so and the interesting

289
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing was</font>

290
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,040
the bitcoins were actually transferred

291
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:23,120
out like pre<font color="#E5E5E5"> clothes to the point where</font>

292
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,920
the laptop suit so often I've done a few

293
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,800
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that yes they're going</font>

294
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,660
to remain well soon as well so I tonight

295
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,760
I thought I did add a kind of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

296
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,439
did chase chase through those

297
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,480
transactions a little bit but it got

298
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,550
Tyson line you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ministry told me</font>

299
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,110
taking place and so forth and I got a

300
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,329
really good a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> disabused to deduct I</font>

301
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,070
never actually did find out in time how

302
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,410
can I deal and they've gone with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long</font>

303
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,390
time ashore and there is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> person that</font>

304
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:53,990
knows it's really but if he's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

305
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:57,770
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I got some media attention</font>

306
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:00,080
at the time when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened the way</font>

307
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,930
when the gossip members went to trial

308
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,480
there's some media attention in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

of the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that media attention and</font>

310
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,120
I had the opportunity to meet with

<font color="#E5E5E5">staffer and we met in this color is a</font>

from weird subterranean underground

313
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,880
studio that we met in and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to ask</font>

him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and weird like to be able</font>

they were intrusively primaries I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

317
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,069
but it was fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that'sthat's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

studio<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there only see the two chairs</font>

319
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,589
there and whenever when I first went in

320
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,880
practice own<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff which took 21 around</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the back it wasn't allowed to meet him</font>

322
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,640
in to the point where the cameras are

323
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:44,240
rolling they wanted us to have an

324
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,770
initial reaction when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we first met so so</font>

325
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,010
he was he was like something different

326
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,449
area of the studios are completely so I

327
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,649
walked in the person

328
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,029
SAT there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty washed out but</font>

329
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,759
I've sat down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that share that one</font>

330
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:59,119
with the Army's I last complete psycho I

331
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,970
was told no you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> cigna that's my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">status check all right why is that ago</font>

333
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:10,369
he got hit first so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> figured you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

334
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:11,540
Star Wars pretty oh so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that</font>

335
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you're not going to get a little</font>

336
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,849
talking more hours in general cheers you

337
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:20,809
actually cool and you're constantly

338
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:24,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">bugging interesting so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do I talk</font>

339
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:25,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is its methods of abilities</font>

340
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,229
hacking and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having confidence</font>

341
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:30,589
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply not to talk about only</font>

342
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,449
really so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about very</font>

343
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">little actually about systems</font>

344
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,649
applications never consider German

345
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,209
philosophy about pretty much because the

346
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:39,499
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that is because loads of</font>

347
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:42,949
people talked about that already and

348
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,540
because most people who talk about

349
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,819
afterwards and probably do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

350
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,349
target environment as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm going</font>

351
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,389
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave that to others I'll talk a</font>

352
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,119
little bit about people are social

353
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:55,759
engineering fishing and I'm going to

354
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:58,189
particularly talk about going to use as

355
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,259
a case example because obviously have

356
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:04,039
some interaction without which would go

357
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:06,529
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends here so we talked about</font>

358
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:11,510
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it spread and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works a little bit how</font>

359
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:16,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'd assorted it same way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe</font>

360
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,750
how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> undertake me tight and and what</font>

361
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:22,250
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent this kind of</font>

362
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,839
thing happening what a comprehensive and

363
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,209
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do to try and mitigate it a</font>

364
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,379
little bit and will slow down or maybe

365
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:35,929
really give up caramel and those big and

366
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:38,210
just advise a bit of time so so quickly

367
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,980
on why why applications are vulnerable

368
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,570
well I think applications of<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

369
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,509
books this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just my take</font>

370
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:47,120
these things that I'm citing<font color="#E5E5E5"> them buddy</font>

371
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:49,580
other than myself on this application

372
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,959
developers are under pressure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

373
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,809
there's a port<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to lose</font>

374
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,340
wives often and another experiences in a

375
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,750
previous life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was an application</font>

376
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:01,220
developer I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 20 years but I</font>

377
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,779
did it right and and that can work

378
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,190
actually well for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason why</font>

379
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:06,320
didn't it work out too well for is

380
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:10,370
because you know I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

381
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,870
software that worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it dawned on me</font>

382
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in a small consultancy</font>

383
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,989
complete that's not a good idea because

384
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,178
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> write if you wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write software</font>

385
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,460
it is but it isn't if you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job</font>

386
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:22,129
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to write software that works</font>

387
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,440
then that takes time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay on this</font>

388
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:27,529
particular organizations which I've

389
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,019
worked for it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work either the way</font>

390
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:31,730
they wanted to do it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> writer software</font>

391
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the minimum of functionality right just</font>

392
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">get kind of basically a little bit doing</font>

393
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,590
what it's supposed to do once it's done

394
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,789
that will ship it okay it's bound to go

395
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,259
wrong we know that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

396
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">around in your toggle resources if</font>

397
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:46,129
properly but when it goes wrong we're

398
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,259
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in there fixing it I'm</font>

399
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:49,519
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> try 24 now and then they say why</font>

400
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you charging money for this when</font>

401
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,210
will actually been to the fourth place

402
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,518
was there are hard and they will take a

403
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,610
pause go and show them<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font>

404
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,230
that isn't what was requested so you

405
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,399
know it's a bad way of doing business to

406
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,720
be honest with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the company's got on</font>

407
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:04,399
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hardly surprised but</font>

408
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,960
there's a lot of this that goes on you

409
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:08,029
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to people nervous a lot of</font>

410
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,220
this it goes on so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> under pressure</font>

411
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:13,009
are you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep their jobs to</font>

412
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter to Tropico fast and if you're</font>

413
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:16,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut corners quite often what</font>

414
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,668
happens with many developers if they cut

415
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:23,539
corners in terms of security and

416
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:26,269
robustness and tolerance and the other

417
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:29,750
side of this is I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some friends</font>

418
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:33,320
who see developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> consultants and you</font>

419
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,299
know I'm told by them that if they miss

420
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,659
deadlines certain contracts which<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

421
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,680
house

422
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,390

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,010
software developed within the period at

424
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,600
the time they're given that they get

425
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,340
fine so the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money then get</font>

426
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,860
decreases I'm really taken off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

427
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,050
each day they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are beyond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the deadline</font>

428
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,850
and when they serve this piece of

429
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,100
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> is must be produced so if</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consultant and you know you're</font>

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,949
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> this money and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you think she's up</font>

432
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,500
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what idea be pretty much</font>

433
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,610
he works<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right I need probably</font>

434
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,710
another three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> days going to</font>

435
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,870
security right but what then like you

436
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,640
know what do i do do do do i do the

437
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,659
right thing I mean I tell you tell the

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">company but maybe they weren't</font>

439
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,830
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know you do the right</font>

440
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,420
thing and you and make you secure the

441
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,120
next three<font color="#CCCCCC"> days or do you make an extra</font>

442
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">grand and I'm going to go that point</font>

443
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">cloud depends on your ethics doesn't and</font>

444
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,640
but I imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're everybody has rd</font>

445
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:25,280
ethics escape for functionality of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

446
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">security right so encoders will do some</font>

447
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,330
absolutely not obviously no those guys

448
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,680
because we're we're all really ethical

449
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Congress and like to do things properly</font>

450
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,320
but and so they scope it simply for what

451
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,980
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked to do so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whereas</font>

452
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,659
do ABC it does AB&C I really we ought to

453
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">check to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's secure to</font>

454
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,470
conscience in terms of X Y Z but that

455
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't get done some rotten scopes</font>

456
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,380
wasn't asked to do that makes the work

457
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,110
for a company after I moved on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

458
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,040
other place i did another programming

459
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,800
job and

460
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,740
and within that environment they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

461
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,980
was kind of a half joking half real

462
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:08,630
mater and the motto was if it compiles

463
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,250
ship it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

464
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:15,050
genuinely believe I happened actually

465
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:16,070
more often to<font color="#CCCCCC"> insure them so the other</font>

466
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,750
part of it is people are lacking

467
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,760
experience understanding right so

468
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,160
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at doing her</font>

469
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,570
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so this can happen quite a</font>

470
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,130
lot I think one of the problems is when

471
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,530
you look at things like you know JSP and

472
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,000
PHP this looks beautiful high level

473
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,010
languages in there so quick to learn and

474
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,600
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can make the</font>

475
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,050
functional so quickly with them because

476
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just our difficult ism and as a</font>

477
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,500
result of that functional<font color="#E5E5E5"> code can be</font>

478
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">broken generator pretty quickly so</font>

479
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys who are going in there's</font>

480
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:46,129
placement students or interns and there

481
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,300
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they're generating web systems</font>

482
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,770
all the bells and whistles on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

483
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,620
great and positive thinking she's

484
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,730
wonderful not realize is great but they

485
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,739
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> experience or</font>

486
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,270
understandings you realize so they are

487
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,560
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of really</font>

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,310
important testing that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing and and secure coding records</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

490

at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> holiday them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there maybe they are</font>

491
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,270
even aware of me<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything in some</font>

492
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,750
instances so things go wrong right so

493
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the low expertise means needed to</font>

494
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,840
write function York aid but a higher

495
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,670
expertise needed to actually ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

496
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,320
safe and stable and there's a lot of

497
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,780
focus on bells and whistles particularly

498
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,080
newbies which can get organizations into

499
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,899
trouble but that's my magnanimous view

500
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,149
of Paul application developers us alike

501
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,840
as we try to give them an excuse right

502
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,760
so I'm being courteous there and now in

503
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,080
the run-up to this event I did spend

504
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,950
quite a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I'm trying to</font>

505
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,350
persuade the swagman shuffler to

506
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,020
actually do a talk for us and basically

507
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a talk about you know how long sec</font>

508
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,780
didn't had to go get right sorry so the

509
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,920
men's<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they used to to to to to</font>

510
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,300
penetrate these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> into to get all</font>

511
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data which they can hold on and</font>

512
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,009
you know quite a bit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Troy to try to</font>

513
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,889
persuade<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't work out again</font>

514
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:06,340
sorry not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> again but what he did do is</font>

515
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:09,158
he gave me his view on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the reasons</font>

516
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> others attacks occurred and the game</font>

517
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:14,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">game perhaps a less Magnus view of a web</font>

518
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,168
application developers and I said they

519
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:20,709
said this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is his permission or I've been</font>

520
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:29,710
a screenshot of the video tweet session

521
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:32,080
that we had a Latin this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

522
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,639
yeah it's like I'm putting my name's

523
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,259
about it we're learning really feels as

524
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:38,529
though and you know what i did this i

525
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:41,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disappoint to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

526
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:52,360
it actually has a reasonable point it's

527
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:54,129
out of character sacredly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's</font>

528
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,899
that systems that's why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

529
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,158
systems are quite variable and some of

530
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:58,750
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to but this is</font>

531
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,009
still about people right so I haven't

532
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,389
talked about anything technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

533
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not going to go to technical</font>

534
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:06,399
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything their technical it goes</font>

535
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,168
use but i'll keep you to live it but

536
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:10,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still about people right so</font>

537
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,070
systems are vulnerable because of people

538
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,779
systems are<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable because of people</font>

539
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,850
not doing their jobs properly or because

540
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're aisle or because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there'd</font>

541
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,070
really or whatever the reasons are

542
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:23,379
either their issues with people and also

543
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,210
in terms of how experts can occur there

544
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,939
are also issues with people it all boils

545
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,509
down to people

546
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:32,000
right why things don't work out right

547
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:34,789
and so I'm talking little bit about

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,490
social engineering now because you know

549
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,750
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about why breaches occur</font>

550
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,220
the bulk of that I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

551
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,740
know how figures for it okay I can't

552
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,600
find any stats to to to reference or

553
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">site on this as an academic as painful</font>

554
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,059
right but I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find them that that</font>

555
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,740
stipulated that the majority of breaches

556
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:54,080
occur initiative because of some kind of

557
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:58,129
social engineering or fishing but my gut

558
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,629
instinct is they are so so there are

559
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys are quite from from social</font>

560
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:03,649
engineering doll which is a pretty good

561
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,200
website actually if you guys have chat

562
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:07,969
around let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me look at any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

563
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,649
influences a person to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take an action</font>

if I say if I say like this you believe

621
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,928
ok so we're program in a certain way you

622
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,669
know like social interactions we go we

623
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:32,259
like anybody likes to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

624
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:34,299
problem as well nobody likes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

625
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:36,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of people it's more difficult</font>

626
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:40,090
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for certain people it's</font>

627
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:42,219
extremely difficult so now so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I</font>

628
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,988
think social engineering is our

629
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,210
statistics but villagers possible for

630
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:49,250
many additional breaches passwords

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:53,529

632

except all of this stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

633
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:59,419
social engineers are I try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

636
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,830
systems and I think I love and this is

637
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,620
about the psychology of persuasion right

638
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,120
so this is a sort of full key and moving

<font color="#E5E5E5">on to fishing you can probably gathered</font>

640
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,270
at the bone there's four key areas where

641

something they were particularly

interested in you might want to pursue

648

and remember god<font color="#E5E5E5"> newton information as</font>

653
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,320
thing I think is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

654
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,178
regulated because it can cause<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,200
hear you make the reaction before your

actually do something pretty done and or

00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,800
offering a reward so anything having

660

reading so if they think they made the

661
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:07,300
maybe a quick win therefore they can

662
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,860
fall for this and you know what can I

663
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,090
don't know but there's a bigger

664
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,070
percentage of you right now we're

665
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,929
thinking you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not okay because</font>

00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an exploit I'm not afford to risk</font>

667
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:20,830
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> an expert but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

668
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:22,960
it's really really easy to do when what

669
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,879
about Twitter for instance you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all</font>

670
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,740
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> links and photos that are on</font>

671
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,470
Twitter are you telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> you never</font>

672
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:32,500
click on any of them not one ever right

673
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,390
I think you know I find that pretty hard

674
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:40,750
to believe although I'm sure maybe some

675
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:45,730
of you do so interesting to expand long

676
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:47,500
isn't it so in terms of trust I<font color="#CCCCCC"> councils</font>

707
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:54,490
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but a lot of people did</font>

708
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,629

<font color="#CCCCCC">twigs becoming even sugar being cast by</font>

polymerizing so it's very easy to do

712
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:08,060
right so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fall for that but</font>

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that that those tweets</font>

714
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,440
were sent out so I went on to the online

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,290
festivals at which we catalogued right

716

getting one percenters probably like a

721
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:27,290
hundred or maybe you know closely but

722
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,570
that would have could have fallen for

723
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,060
that and then I actually actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

726
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,510
and then I contacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news i'm</font>

727
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,460
running trust these guys operate because

728
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,070
they really should they should tweet now

729
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,900
and apologize to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody for this</font>

730

<font color="#E5E5E5">us to be formed in that way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:10,890
even if or am I want to fall in for that

through wordpress they subsequently

873
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,770
close up there I think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix the gaps</font>

874
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,210
in this and the change because<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords</font>

875
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:14,150
will rest of it but they forgot us

876
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:15,829
having dinner how they did this if there

877
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:19,190
hadn't managed to talk about it don't

878
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:21,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">let but they didn't change the reset</font>

879
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,500

880
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,390
changed okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot password again</font>

881
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,900
because that's really gay New York and

882
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,190
just just carry on cause and John so

883
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,869
they also got access to a bunch of

884
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:38,450
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media accounts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">viruses and capacity vegetables as well</font>

888
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,618
so they've got home loan lender stuff

889
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:52,730
and a load of access just film that one

890

then stuck with lows in Kernow keep

898
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:13,420
spraying this is just exploiting

people's dumbest to its full potential

900
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,619
and the full story is there I don't

<font color="#CCCCCC">think access to be startled if you doing</font>

903
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:27,530
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know my gun from I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

904
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,180
speed up so there's one of the things

905
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,510
which is making what we particularly

906
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,578
concerns me in some ways I guess is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

907
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,920
use of tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they make social</font>

908
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:38,800
engineering a heck of a lot easier and

909
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,099
if you use the associated in toolkit

910
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:49,130
yeah third perhaps ok so it's written by

911
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:51,170
David Kennedy already and

912
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,609
written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> python is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> partly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linux read</font>

00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,920
and it allows for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the automation</font>

914
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:56,359
phishing scams so you can you can tell

00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,329
you complete your website clone it in

916
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,828
the popular one is gmail Clint email you

917
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:01,910
send the URL to somebody they just went

918
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,619
through treacherous apparently when they

919
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,180
entered they get entered into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> set of</font>

which is iCarly units you can see them

921
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,700
be entered them you can compromise their

922
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:12,379
information that way it's also

923
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,848
integrates with metasploit critics q

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,089

928
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,940
web content and you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can create</font>

929
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,559
things like a digital series of popular

992
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:14,439
from from a trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with the</font>

993
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem point of view is is an issue so</font>

994
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,009
I've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly survey through</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">goes easy to let myself short of time</font>

996
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:29,109
and so that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing there and</font>

997
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:30,759
so goes east ancillary it combines both

1001
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,190
is what makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a such a dangerous</font>

1021
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,980

1023
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,920
so this isn't a case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like you bring</font>

before it actually reaches your your

1028
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,750
your browser so it injects additional

1029
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,430

1031
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:51,890

1032
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:53,660
is your banking URL a window https green

everything's perfectly happy insecure

1035
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,480
and then the malware is injecting these

1036
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,500
forms in line with your bank's phone

1037
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:04,940
falls asking for additional

1038
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:07,070
authentication which you type in if you

1039
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,080
don't know any better ok so this

1040
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,000
includes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> account which you just you</font>

1043
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,040
and getting that came back suspecting

1044
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,040
that as well

1045
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:28,170

we have the 80s probably set online

1087
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,529
would be to break this link in order to

00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:07,279
prevent communication to the proxy nodes

1089
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,660
and the last drop server and the way the

1090
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,010
algorithm is coded is such that when

1091
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happens we realized it can't</font>

1096
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,700
the bad guys they only need to reach the

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,380
one of those domains and just wait right

1098
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:33,710
the people's perfect machines to connect

1099
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:36,940
to it so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was subverted it was</font>

1107
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:55,578
the initial point was the commander

1108
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,829
occasions were disrupted so there was a

1112
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:05,598
which is pretty easy he just you know

1113
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:06,920
what if I'm dns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font>

00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple to do it but then obviously it</font>

the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for this were</font>

happened was some time to spend a good

1132
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,519
engineer to defend generation army so it

1133
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:54,619
worked out like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how he generates 4,000</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the clock so so the thousand didn't</font>

1136
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:01,940
imagine the generator would depend upon

1137
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:03,410
the the time of day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we worked it out</font>

1138
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,059
will work talk about to reverse engineer

1139
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:10,249
like as soon as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we could sink</font>

than issued a two-week warning having

1146
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:25,160
taught I can't tell you why that is I

1147
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,450
know why it was but I up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I don't</font>

1148
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,140
know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lifetime</font>

it's not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting actually</font>

1150

working himself and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1151
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,230
left so everything seemed following my

1152
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,350
guys didn't do anything after that up

1153
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:43,080
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> like where we are today yesterday</font>

fast plots where where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP addresses</font>

1159
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,390
is rotated through each debate quickly

1160
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,530
which makes it more difficult if you

1161
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,299
were sort of broccoli lose your life

1162

00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:07,200
for me and so what can be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,339
where you actually see your<font color="#CCCCCC"> fundable</font>

1166
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,930
contacts to say is this transaction

that takes out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bounds from the front</font>

1170
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,010
