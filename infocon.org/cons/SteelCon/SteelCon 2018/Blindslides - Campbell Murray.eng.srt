1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:19,848
now that's a very brief opening talk and

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:29,710
after this then what exists go on would

3
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:29,710
add got some from

4
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:46,899
yeah so I just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> just there put my</font>

5
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:49,210
foot for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go yeah don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry</font>

6
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:52,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll see what's on these slides that</font>

7
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,969
will determine your fate so I have no

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:05,679
subject now i'm done with what i wanted

9
00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:07,899
to talk about that hell yeah so I ok

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,610
yeah what else are going to expect so to

11
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:15,399
be perfectly honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe there are</font>

12
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,780
20 slides all right this is now

13
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:18,789
completely improvised from this point

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,640
onwards also still con like to do things

15
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:23,380
slightly differently I do hope wherever

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,960
the organizers of all hidden as well

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,658
where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I do hope that this</font>

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,830
becomes a tradition for seal cons going

19
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,270
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if it turns out on the</font>

20
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,710
only person who gets lumbered with this

21
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:37,030
I know you're my friends are now I did

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,219
not write these slides I've never seen

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,860
them so very we're going to talk about

24
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:45,509
opening effective PowerPoint files<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

25
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">right let's see what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all about</font>

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
what

27
00:01:52,689 --> 00:02:07,279
now I'm lost me gotcha<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay apparently</font>

28
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:11,410
I'm a digital outlaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome and I'm</font>

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,410
thirty-three percent cheese allegedly oh

30
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,760
well played well played yes I'm

31
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,349
thirty-three percent cheese and may

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:28,130
contain nuts and apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> the movie</font>

33
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,869
pointless bullet points how do we get

34
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,549
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here well I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got I think we've</font>

35
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,380
got a taste of where this is going so

36
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:42,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">far so nothing is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to surprise me</font>

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:43,790
now legendary if you find this in a

38
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,619
PowerPoint slide when you open it I

39
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,679
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safely say that you have</font>

40
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,530
been infected not necessarily with

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,650
anything related to cyber but that has

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,540
going to change my a priori concept of

43
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:04,010
the world going forward from this point

44
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:15,260
onwards certainly is I work I I have

45
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:17,450
none ah ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I really there is really</font>

46
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,260
nothing I can say about that not in the

47
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,290
context of information security anyway

48
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:26,989
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dreading the next one alright</font>

49
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,798
charts<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok week and each else maybe what</font>

50
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,799
on

51
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay mmm see I should never be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,329
stand-up comedian I don't be rubbish on

53
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,430
whose line is it anyway say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font>

54
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,709
really then there's the explanation for

55
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,290
why the hamburgers are taken over

56
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,739
people's heads and eating zombies but

57
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,420
look of it I'm really really not sure

58
00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:05,200
what's good way yeah where do we start

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:05,200
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this exactly Oh guys come on I</font>

60
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:13,670
thought you were my friends it's it is a

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,260
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wild West intersect and this is why</font>

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,570
I don't might actually mind doing this I

63
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,079
do a lot of talk a lot of talks a lot of

64
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,090
conferences and also I'm quite heavily

65
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,060
invested in getting people into the

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,948
industry mentoring in not setting

67
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,479
standards but maintaining an increasing

68
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,039
standards but that doesn't even have a

69
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,740
bit of fun mix things up every now and

70
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:37,550
then however<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I know the names of the</font>

71
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,740
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote these slides are at the</font>

72
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,300
end allegedly so I've been told her vile

73
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,000
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pull you now Mike would head</font>

74
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,130
where are you these are leg<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,570
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of the people who wrote</font>

76
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:52,010
these slides aren't even here possibly

77
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,169
three to constrain to the dogs so where

78
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,840
do we start I think the analogy here has

79
00:04:54,169 --> 00:05:00,080
got to be something to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

80
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:05,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">know i really i really don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

be in the beginning dog created man

90
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,940
apparently certainly I don't think he's

91
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,469
really created anything that's animal

92
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:35,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly pulled apart plant your</font>

93
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,080
bin bags in this time he created a mess

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,240
okay there really is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir I was told</font>

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,400
that there would be a thread running

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:53,340
through this I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seeing it yet is</font>

101
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,590

which raised it does raise an

112
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,559
interesting point because we're looking

absolutely no threat whatsoever to this

150
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:29,520
the story behind how these slides came

151
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:32,310

162
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,580
does remind me i really really do want

167
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,870
interesting anyway how often act is said

168
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,609
that's actually very true I don't think

169
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,170
Canadians really do say that that often

170
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,850
what one word that if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry I think that would be a completely</font>

different completely different bar chart

174
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:44,150
like my mind right now the slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

175
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:48,100
intentionally blank are some sponsors

of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do like to do is</font>

back a day later running map again

264
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,420
you'll probably find slightly different

conditions at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time so actually there</font>

268
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,319
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of common sense I think</font>

00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:42,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's going to be all the content you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can see in these slides in Iceland yeah</font>

271
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:49,149
that's very true because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one's got</font>

272
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,829
time for that really nobody does a bit

of advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> though if you don't read the</font>

with a UDP scanning just a little tip

278
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,660
from experience is ping the target first

279
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,850
have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what the latency is in</font>

280
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,649
milliseconds and you can set the maximum

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,240
time out for UDP traffic in milliseconds

282
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:12,579
it's of temps and higher than what the

283
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,139
pings latency is that way you're not

284

coming back it's not coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back just</font>
