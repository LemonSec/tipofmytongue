156
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,579
to the top so policy and cases he
responds

157
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:29,029
that's all there is to it and we can
talk a little bit about what they use

158
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,750
things full policy look

159
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,750
but he hears me talking about separation
of denser

160
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,550
and stroke you talking about committed

161
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,839
what is supposed to be home especially
dated

162
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,950
200 work so it's a

163
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,890
example here we have the sample security

and business CSP roasted almonds on any
browser supports and security policy

204
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,069
to growing that have not succeeded

205
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,660
so that's a good thing you want

206
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,569
nice security policy and that's what it
looks like

207
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:49,570
us I'll

208
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,839
room wall

209
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,850

210
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,470
let's look at it for a while and sorry a

211

obviously

212
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,569
sell for around groups oppose it follows

213
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,260
is his said really respectful

214
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,189

be there when

215
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,340
which is great saver communities the
sooner

216
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,040
rooms force finishes this okay

217
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,280

a soul so

225
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,600
we see an example to assist the
replacement

226
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,950

293
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,810
past this point thinking nozzles who

us about

295
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,030
already would make things really so you
know

296
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,210
long strips potholes last-minute

297
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,130
is really going on spiritually hit six

298
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,420
is the weather yesterday's yes and

299
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,500
sure you told us the is we

300
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,460
policy we had a good portion of things
will

301
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,270
is do strange monsters in ourselves good

302
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,660
then if you do that outpost to you last

wrong scripts we've got speech injection
Parliament

304
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,280
start right so CSP

305
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,440
can be syriza very all

306
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,240
balancing to your appliances existing
loans

307
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,270
hands we in bed and the reason is
simple:

308
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,290
me is this if we build and security
features

309
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,550
consumers going to the truth going to
standards process to

310
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,280
whose it's really simple securities
needed

311
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,080
for the invite to the web we goals and
not just wheels

312
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,220
it with the world surely is that with me

313
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,840

impossible really difficult to apply it

326
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,730
to only

327
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,280
law can fix it rooms and Nazi salute
people that mean tennessee's capital and

328
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,910
fix the problems

329
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,940
so you know vision well use

330
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,860
just great looking for example will
probably change is that the name

331
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,110
Brittany

332
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,389

James people James St which

343
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,440
whose the most importantly

344
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,110
says he is going to change beaches
realized fast thats

345
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,869
with doing week goes as soon as two
straight to means that people talk use

346
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:23,990
and so CST wall

347
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,369
to visit house schools to

348
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:30,980
include things like a monstrous to do
since I

349
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,390
well house house

350
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,770
we'll see received and no

351
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,320
there a better to light as well so so
that is that

352
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,990
removers to stall like and

353
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,690
in Wonderland rose way uses his profile

354
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,870
today he violation

355
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,260
the will be missed from you'll told you
know it

356
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,490
gone wrong his policies stop

357
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,090
so that the Browse escort and what went
wrong

358
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,610
Wahine and thanks to our tools
invitations

359
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,850
which trying to do things like and
launch missiles policy

360
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,990
flames so that changed

361
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,290
let's look at the menu features in

362
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,480
said into hands think about it

363
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,790
so this one is

364
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,809
and feature pools no

365
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,960
source no knowles

366
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,360
isn't be walls this source

367
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,469
the movie scripts that we known we r

368
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,350
there you go

369
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,559
Bros and not so

370
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,780
reinforcing its way say what we need to
do

371
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,940
we distinguish in adopting this loading

372
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,250
between supposed to be understood

373
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,270
relation okay so certainly does missed
dose frequency

374
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,440
already we need to do is we need them to
be at

375
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,700
be script is injected don't want

376
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,450
and the Weather Channel solstice

377
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,010
is SS yeah Crayton on 72

378
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,070
still on the policies all and

379
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,280
what we're going to do it began to
attackers

380
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,360
little casualties on the street and
documents which will mean Tennessee

381
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,100
okay see Greg Street you get is enormous

382
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,129
in the animation I'm said his Nazi

383
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,299
munchies models conscripts teens

384
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:35,809
you know district's so that she's the
same

385
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:41,350
and example we have for I have to change
it to influence in

386
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,939
in my strips don't and

387
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,299
to prove the charge to still work

388
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:56,299
for looked

389
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,710
so policy you see this not funny

390
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,950
policy and through the streets the
replies to this using

391
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,380
Howell the page you can see

392
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:17,380
scriptures posted

393
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:25,340
the services fears print

394
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,260
so

395
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,470
the clint that

396
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,700
you see those license for is meant to be
that is still would

397
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,020
for we still do injection for

398
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,420
and you can see the Jets returns is
still there

399
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,780
and

400
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:54,780
yet

401
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:59,039
and yet and you difference between
Spears

402
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,179
and he and one for this is one of the

403
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,039
passes norms news and this

404
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,190
really useful PC go they seized

405
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,450
all you have to do to change locations
me he said

406
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,840
s is set up this post find

407
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,249
sure you do strips warned km to make
sure they don't have any

408
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:27,320
touch divergent and

409
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,480
ass past actually used to use for it so
intentionally

410
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,509
what he is only 14 prosperity homes

411
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:39,059
this is an internist you need to keep
using it

412
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,178
room you can punish to most russians

413
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,779
intense schools feature you've got away

414
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,460
MITI to pro just right to pay

415
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,679
but I started out when we talk about
prosecuting striking

416
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,109
bastards because there are and strips
which can burn

417
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:02,289
that there is a prosecuting batches and

418
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:06,340
Melissa abstained across New York donors

419
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,539
with JavaScript he doesn't fix the
problem

420
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,840
complete speeches we might have you ten
fifteen years

421
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,889
static content on our Site we don't we
want

422
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:20,488
you going to change many issue no
contingencies

423
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:24,279
the don't have lost four more goals
generated follows

424
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,529
we have to go Hulu andrew Lee

425
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:31,590
straight to business you know do this
trip we are injecting

426
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,769
this had a in this strips actually

427
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,999
so we do that not take too salty

428
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:41,779
the next said Texas Aussie nurses

429
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:45,090
the key feature which is schools

430
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:52,090
shoals Sasha source

431
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,399
and seems to have chosen to do screws or
seat

432
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,630
right as in this house what happens is
when we said don't

433
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,070
what we do is we say okay

434
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,720
we know that the whole this document is
lots and

435
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,070
change it's something we should start
from this

436
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,679
okay jury selection of because injects

437
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,000
the strippers use knows its

438
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,970
so instead it's a all the most recent

439
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,160
I'm going to generate actual attacks
major

440
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,240
say 12 something oh yes sir

441
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,420
CST I wanted to ask you yes

442
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,800
the whole ashes strips people

443
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,260
okay pounds began chasing

444
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,020
so it's a same a don't assess the
hospital

445
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,290
on exactly the same thing

446
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,710
same hash

447
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,020
puro is the same no

448
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:02,030
yeah differences yes we will close
yesterday

449
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:09,030
and this time we can see

450
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,810
cash said with that policy this s

451
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,720
suspected you want to run and anything
else

452
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,750
I don't want okay so

453
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,130
again talking full home

454
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,360
and change who still districts in at the
documents

455
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,530
which also thing from the URL ash

456
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,220
and does not think that it's still there
yellow

457
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,360
yet CST say

458
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,090
a so he told

459
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,270
don't use sorry but it's true policy

460
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,360
STK loss we can and that

461
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,479
take questioned to work I and

462
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,710
using the stash snow actually this will

463
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,030
the sold meant

464
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:09,370
okay

465
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,610
so those are to UCSD

466
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,580
features and a stun no National Mall

467
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,779
when you use in the speeches you've
gotten really relief because

468
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,010
it for example rosso in which two people

469
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,330
existent and just applying

470
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,389
policies to I'm using scripts cash

471
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,470
him shows a loss

472
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,080
they have a problem the good getting
attention people

473
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,899
time free pastoral perhaps state must be
really careful

474
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,010
I do that 02

475
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,770
hero battles and Django

476
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,950
little Genesee St which and I'll

477
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,110
do venture CST cleanup

478
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,379
and thank you on PJs

479
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,049
to say when the bright we have want any
automatically

480
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:07,908
existing be strips evidence with the
actual

481
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:11,250
he said but also prevent see

482

and here's stress and

485
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,360
and happens with this stress and

486
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,049
time the because we which says that
enabled

487
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:34,918
