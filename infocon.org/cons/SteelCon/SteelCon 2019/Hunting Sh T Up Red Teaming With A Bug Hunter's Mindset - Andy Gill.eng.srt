00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,729
 lot of people who have come

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,960
along to listen to me chat and

28
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:08,210

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,949
something to hide by thankfully this

30
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,080

43
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,690
but that's just just what I've done and

44
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,720
I hack things they're trained with Fame

45
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,280

generation yeah I failed upwards into

138
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,400
this industry like a lot of people were

139
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,020
not really academics some people are

140
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,530
academics and feel prettier uni or

141
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:22,570
larges just stuff not just every nice

142
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,679
stuff all that jazz jazz not just em I

143
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,349
everything at school so I failed every

144
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,580
single exam like it I started so

145
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,000
much my second last year of school I saw

146
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,700
everything

147
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,700
feel that Reesa Reesa that 6-tier filled

148
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,969
up again and OOP someone's waving that's

149
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,670
me

150
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,160
cool so enough about me why the

151
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,810
 you guys in here and quick shout

152
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,540
out to Christy Morgan who can't be here

153
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,040
she did a talk at Latura hat in

154
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,230
Edinburgh and introduced me to this

155
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,750
amazing to wear a coat of f and buds F

156
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,910
and birds essentially do like Artwalk

157
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,870
words I just have spirit underneath

158
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,820
stuff that I love and the top one so I'm

159
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,040
going to give you my understanding of

160
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,580
red teaming bug Bernie's and deep

161
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,790
penetration and so essentially what I

162
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,200
see is what I you know what I think is

163
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,460
what your understanding of red teaming

164
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,289
and I understand retina they might be

165
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,979
different I'm prepared to be wrong

166
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,910
you up sign here and come down and tell

167
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,800
me I'm let you do the

168
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,180
presentation I'm going to talk about the

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,150
unidirectional mindsets

170
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,320
between between red teaming and bugbear

171
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,960
is probably read this book for us to

172
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,360
develop and that how how the techniques

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,580
cross over and how the the similarities

174
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,560
over the very similar I'm also going to

175
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,140
go through a subset of the bug hunters

176
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,820
methodology by Jason Haddix who I don't

177
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,120
know who I used to work for a crow

178
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,670
and apply it to a red team scenario and

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,260
then we and then

180
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,000
going to go through the tactics

181
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,760
techniques and procedures for all of the

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,980
above so for red team for proctored exam

183
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,960
for pen testing a little bit and then

184
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,880
I'll have a little slide a bit and pin

185
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,440
up the future of these three probably

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,670
offend some vendors in the room if

187
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,640
there's any conference ribbon to

188
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,620
apologize so yeah my understanding of

189
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,479
all three chef's to start with just not

190
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,930
to do it but really it's the fun stuff

191
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,780
so red teaming what the is this my

192
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,700
understanding of red teaming is it's

193
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,159
you're bringing a third party entry

194
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,200
organization to test your defenses

195
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,030
you're looking at testing of people your

196
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,770
software your policy is everything in

197
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,690
between you're looking at making your

198
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,659
blue theme better at doing the

199
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,980
job if when you do get people who sell

200
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,630
red teaming which really you're good in

201
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,500
the written thesis it's not that

202
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,400
D priceless well that's not why ever but

203
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,620
realistically speaking you're looking at

204
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,239
finding ways to bypass endpoint

205
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,360
protection you're looking at bypassing

206
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,720
holes and the processes that going on so

207
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,670
if your employee endpoint protection I

208
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,260
my job as a red team is the color site

209
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,090
or maybe not even promised a fashion to

210
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,159
your organization and find bypasses

211
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,799
thick of break your policies procedures

212
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,570
more often than not you'll find that

213
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,640
well deal talk that this modern fishing

214
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,290
is that have massive massive entry point

215
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,900
to organizations it's what we often do

216
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,580
we will find an onion organization find

217
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,440
their head of finance or whatever like

218
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,310
alright cool drop in on length penetrate

219
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,250
pill where I'm hiring for company X how

220
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,800
much my young moment cool I'll double it

221
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,140
open this document please for shell no

222
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,730
mala and you can protect against that

223
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,590
you can employ technologists but the

224
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,090
weakest link in the chain is always

225
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,429
going to be the people you can educate

226
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,590
people but all it takes is one click

227
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,110
oh here get free point hard premium boom

228
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,390
click Share I've not done it personally

229
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,550
I've had people that do it it works and

230
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,679
you're playing on the kind of

231
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,849
psychological say the things like your

232
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,909
friends gonna punch me for the straight

233
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,020
submit make so better background the

234
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,478
often is not a violent person

235
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,740
too much she is really interested in

236
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,240
psychology and she's like every time

237
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,500
someone uses psychology in a statement

238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,670
that's wrong and she just wants to punch

239
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,860
them in the face and I use it wrongly

240
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,839
all the time so I've not got any bruises

241
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,940
any visible bruises but yeah she's not

242
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,790
mad she's a nice person but yeah

243
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,440
that's is sent to the red team yes there

244
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,150
are different definitions across

245
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,170
different industries some people will

246
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,640
define red teaming as what people

247
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,979
understand as an impeller pen test you

248
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,330
go and say you've run respond or you get

249
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,040
hashes you probably ask where you get

250
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,910
the a and some couples will sell that's

251
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,980
already a start

252
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,800
don't do it yourself it's no therapist

253
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,720
and some people will sell fishing with

254
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,030
an Ontario and say that's alright

255
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,800
teammates like no a red team isn't done

256
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,810
in three days if your dinner a team of

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,589
three days you're kidding yourself

258
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,239
realistically speaking you're talking

259
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,890
about two weeks pair so valuable to a

260
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,120
pair engagement and we're not sorry not

261
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,550
pair engagement past time so you're

262
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,650
maybe have an objective of you must get

263
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,780
access to this video of the network and

264
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,490
you've got an open scope and you can do

265
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,270
by any means possible just don't pull

266
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,830
the place up and and then you've

267
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,630
got other scenarios like overall you

268
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,920
need to you need to gain access to this

269
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,330
person's emails or you need to

270
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,120
impersonate this person in gain access

271
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,880
you've then got a different area so

272
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
you've got a similar to rating but

273
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,330
different you've got brand damage so

274
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,240
brand damage is not rating brand damage

275
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,010
it is looking at damaging your brand so

276
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,210
reputational damage I want to set your

277
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,650
 on fire I want to break your

278
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,140
 company I want to be a criminal

279
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,840
have permission to do it now that's the

280
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,670
difference there but that's a kind of

281
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,250
over your regular hey bug Bernie's

282
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,540
they're slightly different so I suppose

283
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,440
you could see bug writings are somewhat

284
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,880
already doing more than they are

285
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,220
fantastic in the sense that they have a

286
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,300
more open school I didn't mention a

287
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,070
previous life

288
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,420
red teaming is generally speaking quite

289
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,550
an open scope there's nothing really out

290
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,160
of scope you'll find that maybe one or

291
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,290
two systems may be critical of your last

292
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,850
name structure at school and you're

293
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,230
maybe have like the ETM since then at

294
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,060
school but somewhere but most most the

295
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,860
tables in very open school like Bernie's

296
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,469
they are very similar in the sense that

297
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,450
the school will be well poteete Yahoo

298
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,040
for example or their no one by Verizon

299
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,660
near scope is generally anything we

300
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,069
owners in school but the only things out

301
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,170
of scope is social engineering so you

302
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,580
can't bottle up on site and be like I'm

303
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,589
built mighty give me a proper

304
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,970
credentials and I think you could

305
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,710
probably try but they won't give you any

306
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,530
money for it the other deference between

307
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,810
bug bounties and red teaming is that for

308
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,280
every speaking for writing your your

309
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,479
your consult at the end of days your

310
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,819
billing on a theory or you're going up

311
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,980
project basis like Bernie's is about you

312
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,720
know fastest finger lost

313
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,090
it's not a sexual term you might think

314
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,800
of it that way it's not you're looking

315
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,740
at finding the bugs as quick as possible

316
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,870
and you get paid per bug it's not like

317
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,240
I'm going to bail you 20 grand for two

318
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,220
weeks more hits I could spend

319
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,840
six years on this and find one bug and

320
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,760
it's a duplicate so get back over it

321
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,470
that's the class the other big thing

322
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,000
about buildings finding duplicates just

323
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,620
a quick show of hands who is about

324
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,310
Honora those bug bounties in the room

325
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,950
and who hand up who has had a duplicate

326
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,689
for something they think is cool

327
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:45,080
yep sucks to be you guys I've had this

328
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,580
in this is awful but and and then quick

329
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,350
quick short who's a red teamer in the

330
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,760
room or who practices red teaming or

331
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,000
thinks they do red teaming after I've

332
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,830
just described it I'm clean nobody okay

333
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,060
so none of you know what the red

334
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,730
team is and you could just understand

335
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,670
what I just a sprain and so then we've

336
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,860
got the other that super ponies whooping

337
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,420
scope red teaming way to school then you

338
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,370
could look in a more closed group it's

339
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,920
being called the commodity more and more

340
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:13,760
so penetration testing penetration it

341
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,829
sense the penetration testing is so

342
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,860
security exercise for a company so

343
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:22,370
you're you're testing in a time limited

344
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,020
period against a specific area of the

345
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,390
business so it might be that you're

346
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,189
doing social engineering but you're only

347
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,990
testing the physical aspects of things

348
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,730
though some companies have coined the

349
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,630
phrase of what giving it's not a

350
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,340
gangbang it's I think it's right let's

351
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:43,640
see see black team in and tell me it's

352
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:47,150
not something river sex I mean yeah yeah

353
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,750
it's it's basically sorry I've not gonna

354
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:53,569
what I've just bought whiskey it's

355
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,790
basically end testing as a commodity in

356
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,840
the sense that you're testing different

357
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,599
aspects the business you might be you

358
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,610
might have five days to paste one web

359
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,070
application and you're reporting things

360
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:10,040
like SSL Scott he'll bite

361
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:11,600
yourself off and it's true he's got a

362
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,099
 hard-on for SSL we just love

363
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,840
that it's just like all right cool

364
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,070
web I mean fair play Tony drives a nice

365
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,280
car he's got all that make this

366
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,830
faster but a lot and but yeah you look

367
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,000
for things like SSL your report and

368
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,760
things that might not not not

369
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,440
necessarily be

370
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,990
portable but it's it's a kind of

371
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,670
overview of security to the business you

372
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,690
wouldn't in a red team technically

373
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,010
speaking you probably wouldn't report

374
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,200
SSL you'd exploit it

375
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,090
so if you've got an all day for approval

376
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,040
you can actually extraction in

377
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,860
exploit that you wouldn't be like oh we

378
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,930
found their SSL v3 that's great there's

379
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,580
a bull risk issue you want go

380
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,040
explore it so the definition pen testing

381
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,500
and that is and now also quite a fashion

382
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,110
perspective it's looking at ways to

383
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,020
exploit so pen testing is tech box Red

384
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,660
Team plug connects point bug they paid a

385
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,970
red team project-based kind of objective

386
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,490
getting in getting out and also pen

387
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,930
testing test to be they can be lots of

388
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,360
things you can cover a constant pines

389
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,500
you can do know people are so important

390
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,390
about your scans as pen test they know

391
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,850
they have been for a while it's not that

392
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,640
 don't send unless it's monkey on

393
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:18,180
site and yeah this has been live stream

394
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,590
so I the internet and yeah but that's

395
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,969
that's my understanding of those three

396
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,830
and then you've got the unidirectional

397
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,210
main sets that is a one I didn't know

398
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,060
what it meant before at this site it's

399
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:30,660
only cool essentially the the

400
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,609
the the scalp share between between the

401
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,469
both fear them what the is a

402
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,480
unidirectional main set I don't know is

403
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,580
a cool part that I've heard our son but

404
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,710
my understanding is that it's the shared

405
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,570
kind of correct me if wrong any any

406
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,640
English graduates in here or people who

407
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,160
put graduates in the literature tell me

408
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,949
I'm wrong it's that the the shared

409
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,469
mentality between the two or three so

410
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,420
you use reconnaissance the same way you

411
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,950
not seeing maybe you use reconnaissance

412
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,959
in pen test and use reconnaissance ready

413
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,000
neutral crisis point buddy they just

414
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,800
they work together in different ways

415
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,530
secret killing missin pieces

416
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,859
how does it work so I'll talk about the

417
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,240
methodology in a minute but the you're

418
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,860
looking at finding things and

419
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,330
implementing them different ways so

420
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,090
where you find a subdomain takeover and

421
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:20,040
what money you may be exploited and put

422
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,660
cross-site scripting in there whereas in

423
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,160
a Red Team if you find a subdomain think

424
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,230
over it you're going to take over

425
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,390
exploiter and leverage it for either

426
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,010
fronting so looking at making it the

427
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,080
front cross they see two very much

428
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,670
and so you send traffic to it and the

429
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,260
organization within sees it know what

430
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,689
watch that's hard to mean so sure that

431
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,460
can be a problem or you exploit it for

432
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,529
fishing cap

433
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,990
you compromised the subdomain open

434
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,920
organization and you host your fashion

435
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,750
content on there

436
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,860
you sent into organization and if

437
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,600
they've got things that main cast is

438
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,120
probably on all our packs because it we

439
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,420
trust star the outlet domain.com so

440
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,250
you're gonna find pastor that way and

441
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,349
what it also does is it looks at

442
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,240
different techniques that you wouldn't

443
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,700
necessary some pentesting so things like

444
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,260
what the main fronting for example the

445
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,490
main fronting you wouldn't use in

446
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,810
pentesting because nine times that

447
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,880
you're not going to see carefully much

448
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,089
repent ethic does anyone not know what C

449
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,600
to free markets and I'm just chat

450
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:15,800
cool that's fine

451
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,330
people understand sort of on top and so

452
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,339
yeah you're looking at you know

453
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,630
definitely the other differences in

454
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,370
reconnaissance between two and people

455
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:25,310
talk but this further on the slides but

456
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,510
and in bug burnings you're doing all

457
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,369
your recon and you're finding your

458
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,600
things and then you're you're acting on

459
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,920
it if you're looking for low-hanging

460
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,930
fruit you find things you report the New

461
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,790
York over there money or if you're smart

462
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,069
you hold your your data and you start

463
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:41,089
putting more and breaking organization

464
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:43,430
and why does each exist so red teaming

465
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:44,900
exist as a discuss start text the

466
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,760
defensive capabilities to testing with

467
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,350
you definitely speaking up on but you're

468
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,240
not really tested with him or if you are

469
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,830
you did great job of it you've

470
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,660
maybe got the organization but

471
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,330
definitely speaking in a bug but in that

472
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,719
sort of scope so scope in the bug but it

473
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:02,000
tends to be quite kind of define once

474
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,100
you find your first you know entry point

475
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,390
you can't then go on or is another red

476
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,829
thing once you've got it football that's

477
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,650
your kind of frost step or maybe even

478
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,089
step zero and a pen test well good

479
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,559
you might get a football that on a

480
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,809
network I had the pen in the scope will

481
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,089
depend on what you can do with it so

482
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:19,910
each exists for each different reason

483
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,159
we're doing everything bug burning it's

484
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,160
a kind of supplementary security program

485
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,839
for what you've got implemented so you

486
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
might you might get like annual pen

487
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,600
testing you might get read to me but

488
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,940
he's got a bug burn and aside you're

489
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,199
going to find school hanging fruit so

490
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,730
those those tools that have been written

491
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,050
in the past couple years every one of

492
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,150
those called asset note which is gap

493
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,830
which should buy two guys I want to see

494
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,240
Australia it might be New Zealand guy

495
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,510
called shops and a guy called now he

496
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,910
wrote it and another guy but essentially

497
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,400
what it does is it monitors specific

498
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,200
assets of an organization and it will

499
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,539
report

500
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,309
I think it checks every 5 of a mess of

501
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:57,190
you if you got a development team not

502
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,960
standing up and I don't test instances

503
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,389
and things it'll pick up a stranger like

504
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,489
a sports bar it'll email them a report

505
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:06,340
and I think it's no Star Trek or data

506
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:10,659
platform so platform being like hacker 1

507
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,668
or setup horror I for example and people

508
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:15,940
have heard of people starting to use

509
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:19,359
that in red teaming and also in threat

510
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,789
intelligence so leveraging continuous

511
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,619
monitoring so W do fare until for six

512
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:25,299
months before the engagement you have

513
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,220
your clients in the books you start to

514
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:28,418
look for exposed portals you start to

515
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,590
look for these bits and pieces and in

516
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,960
your work we've got an engagement coming

517
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,340
up at the end of the year if that's what

518
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,299
we'll keep monitoring and if it's still

519
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,999
there will leverage it

520
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,918
so yeah the dealings as for the reasons

521
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:40,659
each is applicable in a different way I

522
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,330
wouldn't sit I mean some companies have

523
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:45,489
it more often than the states in the UK

524
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,769
a lot of interested because they need to

525
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:49,029
for the place not many companies will

526
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,799
get red team because generally speaking

527
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:53,889
is quite expensive because you're

528
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,450
talking just like two or three weeks so

529
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:57,219
maybe twenty thirty point grander

530
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,919
project whereas the average pentest

531
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,239
couple of grand fr mark Bernie's is

532
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,769
completely different because you

533
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:04,629
probably put a budget aside for it so

534
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:06,279
you might well we're gonna pay up to a

535
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:08,379
little we've got a budget of 10 grand

536
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,970
and if we if you find a critical point

537
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:11,769
about it we'll give you five back so

538
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,200
that's half the budget got already was

539
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:16,029
if they've done pen testing before that

540
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,259
and we put about Burt in place they're

541
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,489
going to be like well we've we've caught

542
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:20,320
all they can all hang out but we're

543
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:23,559
looking for like chained exploit or bet

544
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,210
some pieces so it's cheaper and in an

545
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,220
ideal world you have all three that

546
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,710
maintains a dead you probably have two

547
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,299
or one most companies pen testing some

548
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,730
companies pay interesting and bog bodies

549
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,080
like companies red teaming pentothal and

550
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,850
husband spoke about a scoop of have

551
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,730
things red team's testing your whole

552
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:43,330
stack and so and so forth who does them

553
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:45,460
so Han testing everyone and their dog

554
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,590
can do in testing if you can run esses

555
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,330
you can probably paint this I would say

556
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,428
that's that's not painting a nutshell

557
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,850
but that is a lot of what some companies

558
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,470
sell painting as red teaming it's a lot

559
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,928
more specialized that's a lot more of a

560
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,999
kind of focused mindset so you need to

561
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,279
understand different technologies unity

562
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,409
understand how

563
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,629
the red three works that you get into an

564
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:08,279
organization you have someone who's not

565
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:11,849
be very good at physical solutions near

566
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:14,219
its physical isn't for everyone and some

567
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:17,158
people just don't have the balls or pets

568
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:22,139
don't know what the right is anyway it's

569
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:24,269
a freeze and yeah everyone doesn't it

570
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:26,248
but what Bernie's is an interesting one

571
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,960
because technically speaking anyone

572
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:29,669
could do about Valley you there's no

573
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,139
background checks there's not some

574
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,960
programs that are pattern checks but for

575
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:36,449
most platforms anyone with a computer

576
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,519
can can log on to hacker warden or

577
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,339
quadrant or syn/ack or cobol or any

578
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,889
other platform and DuPont monies and we

579
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:46,168
can have companies without risk of

580
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:48,178
getting sued or prosecuted so it's

581
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:49,859
definitely changed the market I mean

582
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,179
open is a variant for awhile I think

583
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,678
we've been writing for like 20 years or

584
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,599
something Frost was like Netscape but

585
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,099
more and more in the last five years

586
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,979
they've become more and more prevalent

587
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:00,539
and I think there's no more bugs than

588
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:02,519
there are pen tester set in the UK

589
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,679
there's there's people who are as young

590
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,089
as 12 finding one about using Facebook

591
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,309
and getting paid like ten thousand

592
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:11,639
dollars so it's quite a lucrative like

593
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,320
industry when do we do them well a lot

594
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:15,418
of a lot of times you'll find that

595
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,129
people who are deeply deep end casters

596
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,080
will moonlight as a popular I know a lot

597
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:20,549
of people who do it and if I'm honest

598
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,289
it's pretty good money I mean you can

599
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:23,999
find I found a lot of bugs a point hub

600
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:25,469
and they paid me a lot of money for it

601
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:26,729
it's great I got free premium I got a

602
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:28,309
bunch of t-shirts I got stickers and

603
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:30,719
 but he gave you money as well great

604
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,960
but at the same thing we're doing with a

605
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:38,009
job and so yeah it's lots of people who

606
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,809
have different aims so moving on we've

607
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,119
got Ivanka knows methodology this was

608
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,158
written while I see three or four years

609
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,589
ago maybe five and just in how its

610
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,679
presented that at Def Con and he was

611
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:51,570
talking about the different kind of

612
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,460
wrong areas that someone who was wanting

613
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,809
to get into compounding I wanted to find

614
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,839
different bond capacitors we can look

615
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,830
into so you've got the philosophy I

616
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,559
looked into this before they were taught

617
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,689
and I can't find a kind of centralized

618
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,339
philosophy for Batman is different

619
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,859
people have different reasons for doing

620
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:10,499
them some people say I want 3 let's say

621
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:12,658
for her is your weird or

622
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,769
although people I want to make tons of

623
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,419
money I want to drive a nice car or

624
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:16,169
level 8 house or have a nice life yeah

625
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,169
that's fair enough

626
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,549
how many other people they're looking at

627
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:22,409
well I want to improve my skill set

628
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,970
that's but that's why I started a pastor

629
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:25,889
that I started to learn more and I find

630
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,629
that the more things that I find in

631
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:29,369
Gbagbo is I find up being more

632
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:32,639
applicable in my day-to-day jobs I find

633
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:33,959
it a pentesting threatening to like just

634
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:35,549
speaking defiance because a lot of

635
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,779
fights now I'm thinking oh that's a

636
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:38,340
buzzword but this one's were playing

637
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,109
ball we've got everything but we've not

638
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,820
heard about it but we heard that you've

639
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:44,639
found bugs can you talk us through it

640
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,668
it's it's really useful and I'm going to

641
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:49,408
kind of step through that you can read a

642
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,580
lot yet but basically I'm going to put

643
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,289
this on a few of them I'm going to talk

644
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,220
about the shared philosophy between the

645
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:57,509
two so the kind of typically a red team

646
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,830
is slow and stealthy you're looking for

647
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:01,710
pain the objective you're not looking to

648
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:04,499
be in super low about Bernie yeah you

649
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,149
want to be in a patient as well as much

650
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:08,039
as it is fastest finger fast then you're

651
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,998
looking at getting getting the objective

652
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,408
as quick as possible

653
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:12,119
you're also looking at not causing harm

654
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:14,190
because you'll find this we're almost in

655
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,529
time that they like denial services oak

656
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:20,220
scope as it is with most engagements

657
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:21,929
you'll find some clients some industry

658
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,070
people want to do denial service testing

659
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,409
but that's I wouldn't say that paint

660
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,369
this thing I wouldn't say that's like

661
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:28,830
reading about that I think that's a

662
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:30,809
specific area correct move around the

663
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,609
rash there make you some companies that

664
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,658
do that as part of a paint a stone or

665
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:35,549
for a fact any of the companies that

666
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:38,820
walk forward don't hit the market school

667
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:41,158
and but yet I'll always be a ninja

668
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,119
unless it always be yourself a list of

669
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,889
your their job or would be a ninja and

670
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,749
so breaking down the mess and methods so

671
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:50,789
I kind of focus on three of the methods

672
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:52,470
of the the bottles bathtubs because

673
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:54,299
they're directly applicable through pain

674
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,669
tears thing I'll let you discover

675
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,080
identification leverage you arguable you

676
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,509
can see they're the first kind of steps

677
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,600
so you've got one foot you want to be

678
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:06,419
picky about this ship and discovery so

679
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,178
discovery when cyber threat Intel isn't

680
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,679
an option you'll find a lot of the boot

681
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,109
companies in the world will have

682
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,820
parental led red teaming and that's

683
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:15,029
 great but not everyone's made of

684
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,158
money

685
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:18,690
not everyone can have an in-house threat

686
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,159
intelligence probably or in-house threat

687
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,679
intelligence apartment sometimes is

688
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,590
outsource things like seabeds Neil

689
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,210
touched on CBS News talkin smile and see

690
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,209
best needs to be threatened thumb right

691
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:33,720
leg it's your profile an organization

692
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:35,670
and you're finding the pinnace track

693
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,440
what are the what are the stretch the

694
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,000
organization and you're leveraging them

695
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,090
and you're emulating them but

696
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,250
technically speaking as years as Joe

697
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:46,020
Bloggs and doing Bach but I don't have a

698
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,490
threat until Department I can't

699
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,379
afford to do that usually I've got

700
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,240
a couple quid so I'm looking at

701
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,030
leveraging different tools so I'm

702
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,680
looking at historical discovery and as

703
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,050
part of historical discovery you use

704
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,340
things that the Wayback Machine I'd see

705
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,870
Wayback Machine in Google with the two

706
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,230
biggest tools I use all the time and a

707
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,610
 great you couldn't find you felt

708
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:10,650
a Google by x between 2001 to 2005 and

709
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,719
you will find things that are exposed

710
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,080
that I've been exposed to the last 10 15

711
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,700
years and you can get in that way in a

712
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,560
bog Bernie that's a couple of points or

713
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,510
if it's a big company so I phoned a

714
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,310
friend one couple you and I think last

715
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,620
year they before quite a big fashion

716
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,690
company and they had an exposed

717
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,810
yeah they had an exposed and then pouch

718
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,030
so memcache being a service that you can

719
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,860
you can read that species of Spitz it's

720
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,149
used for various functions on the

721
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,129
backend but I found that it exposed

722
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,410
Internet and I could delete everything

723
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,600
on their main website from that specific

724
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,930
bug but I've been that means sitting on

725
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,300
internet for I think the 20 years so it

726
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,580
puts in perspective so using Google to

727
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,169
actually find things that is I mean half

728
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,179
our job is googling I mean if

729
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,310
anyone is to ask you what you do the job

730
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,870
why I'm a professional Google I'm better

731
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,830
at using Google that you are and it's

732
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:05,909
the truth tell me I'm wrong

733
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,860
anyone know cuz it right yeah so

734
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,180
yeah leveraging Google Blair became the

735
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,379
Wayback Machine as well the green light

736
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,210
machine is also very useful because you

737
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,370
couldn't look at a target and how the

738
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,280
target has changed over a period of time

739
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:19,020
so you look at maybe I don't know we'll

740
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,760
take Facebook for example hate

741
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,920
the company but they've got a good plug

742
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,410
that it you look at their platform no

743
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,000
and then you go back five years or ten

744
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,920
years you look at how much it's changed

745
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,180
that there's just a very simple site in

746
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,130
the beginning and they've added more

747
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,600
 there's steps that there's still

748
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,850
more they are they started over Sasha

749
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,679
you tell my great father face wait what

750
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:42,179
those guys and girls yeah you can go

751
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,530
through that before from a red team

752
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,310
perspective that can be incredibly

753
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,080
useful because if you

754
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,060
pick up a target and you want to go

755
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,500
after I don't know their CFO of the

756
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,500
chief financial officer and they've been

757
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,600
the director of that company for a long

758
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,360
period of time they might have profiles

759
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,889
or assets somewhere else and you go

760
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,020
after those assets and you find things

761
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,340
to craft your phishing campaign so it's

762
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,900
all background information that you can

763
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,459
leverage and you can leverage it for

764
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,140
Gbagbo it's like I just spoke about you

765
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,870
can find expose things and later that

766
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,910
way and also passive or essence or

767
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,320
intelligence yeah I mean kind of a

768
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,000
frothy way of describing threat

769
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,500
intelligence is a license to print money

770
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,930
that's essentially what it is it's

771
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,110
nothing more nothing less there is using

772
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:25,140
these sort of things yeah passive voice

773
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,459
in you're looking at and so I've said a

774
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,440
lot of talk about historical discovery I

775
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,150
avoid looking at the main identification

776
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,130
you look at the main muttering so you're

777
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,840
looking at things that you can leverage

778
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,540
sort the minute this will be like

779
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,970
subdomain and brute-forcing you'll be

780
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,909
find that domain comm you may be fine

781
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,550
admin they've got you a key what will

782
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,680
remain calm is exposed internet and you

783
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,600
can leverage that to compress things and

784
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,490
then you've got chilling which I'll talk

785
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,649
about later on and then you've got the

786
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,570
second part which is identification so

787
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,060
once you've done all your discovery you

788
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,200
want to collect on things and

789
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:02,970
you want to map how the external

790
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:06,390
footprint so mapping out the estate once

791
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:09,690
you've found your es ends your your IP

792
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,340
blocks you click them all together maybe

793
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,960
you start to scan them maybe you start

794
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,669
to kind of leverage them and pop the

795
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,780
eleventh the next slide but you're you

796
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,550
can leave everything so you find

797
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,530
definitely speak in London Fog Bernie

798
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,870
I'll do all the subdomain identification

799
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,639
of the Google hacking I'll look at the

800
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,330
IP blocks I'll start to scan themselves

801
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,770
scanning for common ports like 8450 and

802
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,659
see if there's web app run on them if

803
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,360
Athey eight four four three of those

804
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,130
things actually fun crash CCTV at ports

805
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,219
the like theorem just you know

806
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,040
everything for them and but you start to

807
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,270
scan them and then you start to do

808
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,909
active reconnaissance against them so

809
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,800
Chris transfer who spoke either on has

810
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,930
written a great to talk or by witness

811
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,370
and I leverage that or I've started to

812
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,230
use it more in written as well but I

813
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,000
unplugged my whole thing you feed it a

814
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,190
big list of URL that will go in

815
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,169
screenshot them and that is priceless

816
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,919
it's so useful because you

817
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:04,350
have been all 20,000 Trane furnaces

818
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,529
probably quite a lot maybe a hundred

819
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,299
thousand amines and you chuck them in a

820
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:11,369
file so they can be sub-domains

821
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:13,168
different ports different things you

822
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:13,918
feed them into eyewitness eyewitness

823
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,529
will go away

824
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,789
you give it amount of thread Simula I

825
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:19,679
really hate my VPS they give it like a

826
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:22,470
thousand threads around here to me but

827
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,509
anyway it goes away it's screenshots the

828
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,919
mall flopson and a lovely HTML report

829
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:27,239
and then you can click through them and

830
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,549
then you can start identify what's

831
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:32,070
better to go after so out of those

832
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:35,460
100,000 that means maybe iPhone 10,000

833
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:37,799
15,000 that are potential potential

834
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,080
interest a little beautiful thing about

835
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,970
eyewitnesses that it will categorize way

836
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,980
thanks to the meanest so if it's a CMS

837
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,019
or put in that category if it's a login

838
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,389
page it will list wait thanks the

839
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,889
default login details might be a lawful

840
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:51,479
I think in the latest revision that will

841
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:53,488
try and log in to the login page so if

842
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,399
it is admin admin I'll log in and flag

843
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:57,539
it up so that's really really useful

844
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,830
this isn't an advertisement for this

845
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,929
tool but it's really really

846
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,759
powerful what it's also over the years

847
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,499
done I think it stealth Isis it

848
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,570
off-screen sharpens there RDP so if you

849
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:09,899
find 58 name open on a box

850
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:13,950
you've ha get into Iowa's provided a

851
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:15,719
nail I help the network level it

852
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,489
the one that you need to DES it kind of

853
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,960
what's gone anyway rather that's not

854
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:21,200
enabled you can go away and screenshot

855
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,980
it with her prompt her credentials so

856
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,869
does anyone know what that's called I

857
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,549
can always pull off the top my head hey

858
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:28,649
alright yeah thank you

859
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:30,720
so it will go in and screenshot that it

860
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,029
will also do a VNC which is beautiful

861
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,950
you go go through things you find and

862
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:36,869
see if it's read-only if it's right you

863
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,239
can go and exploit that but you can lean

864
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:40,980
on things and you start the map and what

865
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,960
I've started doing more and more and

866
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,169
what I found really useful I spoke of me

867
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,239
yesterday and new workshop is attackers

868
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:50,609
walk off graphs and defenders walk off

869
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:51,149
lists so I've started to graphite why

870
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:53,249
fine

871
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:55,229
so if I find that you've got an endpoint

872
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:57,509
that's got all these all sonic I'll

873
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,609
start to map out online map it'll draw

874
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:01,080
out and they'll be like okay these are

875
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,460
the different attack but these are

876
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,199
writing leverage they get into your

877
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,859
organization this is what I can use to

878
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,749
find phase and if I'm if I'm bug hunting

879
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:10,379
I'll be like right opf oh no I found a

880
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:11,760
login page

881
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:14,669
that's a bug to start with this will

882
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,800
HTTP and most most programs is quite a

883
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,780
loop here however if I can leverage that

884
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,110
find the falklands with Morgan we've got

885
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,340
like five quid or if I mean I've found

886
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,750
stuff previously where you find like

887
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,520
Oracle e-business suite and it's not

888
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,800
default could enter if you log in you've

889
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,150
got access to a lot they are and not

890
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,830
only that if it's out there that's

891
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,570
wonderful things like SQL injection and

892
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,010
you've just got bugs as long as you're

893
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,720
on you can start rating report and

894
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,300
you're just making loads of money from

895
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,680
that that's the box of things correctly

896
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,090
perspective if you get access to that

897
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,320
you can access the business intelligence

898
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,980
you can access to the d30 of the

899
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,419
business and there are other middleware

900
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,160
software is available but ebusiness

901
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,680
suite is so profitable it's

902
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,910
great the x1 so you click on that and

903
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,580
then you're going you actually leverage

904
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,040
it so you can have find the weaknesses

905
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,720
and you start begin your foothold and

906
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,830
I've been kind of echoing it through and

907
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,660
through the top the differences between

908
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,340
reading and bug learning is that social

909
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,200
here intends to be a school social

910
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,840
engineer and you're pawning your

911
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,090
foothold internet work so what you want

912
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,669
to do is you want to find everything

913
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,459
collect it then exploit it so export it

914
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:20,370
via social urine or X both at the edges

915
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,380
coordinate essentially and or you just

916
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,899
call call them up and you go I need your

917
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,170
password is and people get me that kiss

918
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,820
yeah once you're ending in an

919
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,200
organization and a red team you look at

920
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,700
it you know pivoting so you're looking

921
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,900
at lateral open you're looking at you

922
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,090
know moving across the domains

923
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,800
I need different things internally if

924
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,000
your objective is to get a certain here

925
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,190
the network you're looking at how you

926
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,930
get there so maybe your objective is you

927
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,590
may need to get the finance service and

928
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:48,840
it'll store there so you land on one

929
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,300
doing you need to hop over and exploit

930
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,429
that relationships are then move over in

931
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,500
access and by the end of the engagement

932
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,760
got less the credentials and the network

933
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,190
so that's that's the tech you've got

934
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,840
objective one objective to might be that

935
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,520
you actually need to get access to all

936
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,149
the CEOs email so you look at different

937
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,980
ways of leveraging your old once you've

938
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,630
got that you're looking at your kind of

939
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,340
tactics your techniques new procedures

940
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,430
this is a lot of text and do apologize

941
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:18,000
but your tactics is very similar to

942
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:19,590
between cutting and betting that the

943
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,600
tactics that you do to get into an

944
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,070
organization you're thinking like a

945
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,199
criminal the difference between being a

946
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,990
criminal one I'm ginger you don't get

947
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,149
ginger criminals and you might do I mean

948
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,100
and - I've got progression I've got a

949
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:33,719
promotion to do what I'm doing nine

950
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,449
times at Penn I know I always have all

951
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,230
the operations run through and enter

952
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,120
that out of the stream you're looking at

953
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,370
off more specially I thought yeah

954
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,899
definitely occur knows I've got positive

955
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:53,158
on what I'm doing whereas a criminal

956
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:57,029
will just go up and do things also

957
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,220
techniques so previously about submarine

958
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:02,309
takeovers we've got asset identification

959
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,409
and you're looking at kind of faint

960
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:06,360
painting everything map you know red

961
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,860
team is about getting in and getting out

962
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,078
stealthily progress all the fastest

963
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,549
finger puffs for the biggest one so what

964
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,070
I didn't talk about previously is X

965
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,329
completion in a bog Bernie once you

966
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,639
can't play the horse typically speaking

967
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:18,810
an exfiltration at the LBO school or the

968
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,270
red team is probably part of your

969
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,799
objectives in a pen test you're not

970
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,079
really going to do exfiltration of there

971
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,329
unless you're working on like you know

972
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,909
like you're working on approval concept

973
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:31,530
will you either or compromise a payment

974
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:33,450
card server and you've got access to

975
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,579
 thousands of odd numbers

976
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,618
somewhere in my yeah some so on someone

977
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,510
know what good that recently and it's

978
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:41,790
 cool you got access they were

979
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,349
doing a PCI test and they can access the

980
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,000
payment cards Network and they had

981
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:48,000
access to thousands of credit

982
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,770
card numbers stored into your text with

983
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,349
the law correctly from Ron lake worth

984
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,690
the CVE numbers or with owe them with

985
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:56,940
them so yeah thank you serious

986
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,859
stuff if you find that in a pen test

987
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,420
 grapes if you found out that bug

988
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:01,828
bite me you'd be wrong in cash you'd be

989
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,430
 driving Rolls Royces and

990
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:07,589
another like if if you're a deck head at

991
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,118
which some people are you take that do

992
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:11,069
you take that information you sail on

993
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,700
the black market funds and money people

994
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,290
do it

995
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,910
I don't do first thing because I value

996
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,430
my life I don't want to spin like that

997
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,029
in prison some people some people in the

998
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,578
states right now

999
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,750
facing potential stuff for the dead not

1000
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,619
going to mention deemed you might know

1001
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:33,540
him begins with an M and sorry Marcus

1002
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:35,250
and happens but yet I can't watch

1003
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,270
call that any procedures recon you've

1004
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,610
got liberation you've got Paul anything

1005
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,140
but reporting so recon topper extends

1006
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,730
the enumeration once you've got your

1007
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,029
tier you're limiting the network

1008
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,350
remembering the company at the pole - to

1009
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,020
the camera I'm walking about other place

1010
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,660
but you're remembering everything you're

1011
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,830
pulling things and the I guess I suppose

1012
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,660
the biggest difference between pen

1013
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:56,730
testing writing and balance is recording

1014
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,080
for a pen test report you're probably

1015
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,540
reporting on fault lists you're

1016
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,730
reporting on your issues and so though

1017
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,670
you've got headers you find Constance

1018
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,990
crept into an escalation in a bug Bernie

1019
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,000
that's very similar you're reporting

1020
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,100
individual bugs that you've found Pepe

1021
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,710
speaking you'll be one bug report of

1022
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,020
your spot some some programs will we'll

1023
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,490
see what you found XSS on 15,000

1024
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,620
endpoints will not wonder point will get

1025
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,060
the effective code for others will get

1026
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,560
you fifth grade pair reports you can put

1027
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,870
ahead in time to make a popular month

1028
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,610
and what is the difference between that

1029
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,520
Bethenny I dread doing your talking

1030
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,020
about your Padma your attack path red

1031
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,180
teaming is very heavy on documentation

1032
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,460
because you're documenting the steps of

1033
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,049
everything you do so red team is

1034
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,210
speaking a few compromising organization

1035
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,460
you need to have kind of traceable

1036
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,980
almost like a forensic report so

1037
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,590
traceable what you've done so at 3:15 on

1038
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,920
Tuesday marks on Tuesday afternoon I ran

1039
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:52,110
this command on this machine and I found

1040
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,880
this this was the air put so the client

1041
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,040
can go back through the logs they can

1042
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,840
speak their sock and on your and say

1043
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,190
well actually we didn't see that and

1044
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,550
then you can start to look at why that's

1045
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,880
a problem people I don't do it for bug

1046
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,440
Bernie

1047
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,640
I won't that way no one who does people

1048
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,960
would do yeah cool it'd be good for your

1049
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,549
notes and stuff I don't do I think it's

1050
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,120
do an effort for that just separate

1051
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,220
reason for a red team that's you should

1052
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,299
be doing that because without that the

1053
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,640
clients having no value

1054
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,400
the other big difference between a red

1055
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,040
team and the company is you're writing

1056
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,860
about your attack path often the report

1057
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,650
will be a kind of a map of all the steps

1058
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,540
you took so you'll be looking at we

1059
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,890
compromised the organization at this

1060
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,270
part of the business and we got access

1061
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,950
to this part of the network and we

1062
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,570
popped over to hear how my glasses this

1063
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,240
niceness and you'll find that they're

1064
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,740
very bespoke reports often things like

1065
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,209
entice reporting and also poke they are

1066
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,259
important it's been authoring the point

1067
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,970
where you're just pointing quite--quite

1068
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,470
you correct rob you grab your issues

1069
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,089
drag them into the report you're all

1070
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,959
good about giving the various for

1071
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,820
consents arraigning

1072
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,270
what's happened you writing the scenario

1073
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,680
you

1074
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:58,860
in everything essentially and it's very

1075
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,649
kind of big when's quick wins objective

1076
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:05,300
based whereas the other two are not

1077
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,860
subjective based but by seller and the

1078
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,990
can of other aspect and things that is

1079
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,780
coming out more and more automation so

1080
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:15,990
kind of finding the easy low-hanging

1081
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,800
fruit in bug hunting that filleth off

1082
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:21,810
peloton asset no it's paid for too and

1083
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,240
it elements a lot of the kin a very very

1084
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:27,360
very simple stuff so it finds exposed

1085
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,549
git repositories it finds exposed

1086
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,590
conflict files it works from in front of

1087
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,690
us and PHP it will try and exploit

1088
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,610
things like SQL injection well it finds

1089
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,230
them it automate them so it's it's got

1090
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,700
you up in concept maybe if it's SQL

1091
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,150
injection it will find the version of

1092
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,830
the database from the it'll you know

1093
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:48,090
bundle that are up Chuck and report an

1094
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:49,799
email to you then you're better off also

1095
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,660
off the back of operation and you know

1096
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,140
we're definitely a very cool thing this

1097
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,850
morning automating grabbing your Ross

1098
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,960
information at any length we yeah you

1099
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,210
might not use that red teamers

1100
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,130
it's not a being that process of kind of

1101
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,140
infiltrating organization gathering they

1102
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,790
are and then getting out so getting over

1103
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,560
email it's cool

1104
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,270
I've never seen it before and still a

1105
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,720
half symbol for apostasy and we're doing

1106
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:14,970
which is it's pretty cool and

1107
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,740
you'd also not just discover you looking

1108
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,799
at automation of the appointment of

1109
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,379
infrastructure so a lot of stuff that I

1110
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,050
do when I'm back hunting is I've sped up

1111
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:29,190
a doc working here for that specific and

1112
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,869
target and docker is fantastic there's

1113
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,250
so much you can do with it like if

1114
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,859
you've got a tool that requires a lot of

1115
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,840
dependencies rocking length pills I

1116
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:38,759
think the god-awful computer booth over

1117
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,530
here don't run at them good to go

1118
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,570
there's a tool that I used for a DNS

1119
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,580
enumeration called a cathode it's really

1120
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:46,859
based is I think it's no goal based but

1121
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:50,730
you Spiritist had thousands of

1122
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:55,230
like dependencies random lobbies in the

1123
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:56,940
room or not here look he impeached he

1124
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,070
took that and put it at docker container

1125
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:02,250
and I know use it if they saw party

1126
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:04,080
useful like you scope in run

1127
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,040
I want the host and it just doesn't do

1128
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:09,180
anything stall things

1129
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,470
gonna do that other thing up the other

1130
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,450
things you can do is you can automate

1131
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,520
the deployment of Red Team Emperor I'm

1132
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:16,319
seeing it more and more things like

1133
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,030
ansible things that terraform you look

1134
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,160
at it you can opt everything you see to

1135
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,480
very much and automating its automated

1136
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,899
deployment of your CTA very much

1137
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,930
automating your we directors automating

1138
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,910
like if you see automating your build

1139
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,440
process the last time you spend building

1140
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,629
things the more things you spend like

1141
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,250
planning operation more fun you an out

1142
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,020
more benefits to be for the client as

1143
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,580
well because if you can turn around and

1144
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,490
say Angus I can spin up infrastructure

1145
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,900
and half a day whereas they might view

1146
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:46,020
this that they can five days you're

1147
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,990
saving yourself time you're big you know

1148
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,090
giving the client more value how that's

1149
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,430
applicable to pot panning as well as

1150
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:55,710
most of all colors will use either the

1151
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,960
local machine I want people use like VPS

1152
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,520
so being able to deploy a VPS with all

1153
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,550
the right tool set you want for a

1154
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,590
specific types of you if you have like

1155
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,150
well maybe you'd use ansible

1156
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,090
I know a few guys that have as with them

1157
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,290
play books for specific types so I'm

1158
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,840
going to go off the web pockets boom

1159
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,790
playbook so it's built pick up a couple

1160
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,040
of minutes on maybe a billion hour to

1161
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,170
fit terminal you get set up and and

1162
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,330
that's it you're good to go quick wins

1163
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:24,030
it's it's quite blender the end of you

1164
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,819
looking for fun stuff then you get your

1165
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,840
tactics so that this this kind of builds

1166
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,430
on what was discussed now on you're

1167
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,900
talking about your your brand and

1168
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,250
liberation so you're finding the

1169
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,990
acquisitions you're looking at this

1170
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,440
you're looking and going after supply

1171
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:39,000
tear more off they're not and if you're

1172
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,280
going after a big corporate in a bug

1173
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,010
hunt and acquisitions will be in scope

1174
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,900
you'll find that Facebook and Yahoo

1175
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,970
they've got lots of acquisitions and

1176
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,950
lots of little hanging fruit on things

1177
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:52,589
that have been rowing for ages

1178
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,270
like that what talk better on 20 years

1179
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:56,220
the Internet that's an acquisition

1180
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,290
companies buying companies they leave

1181
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,850
them they get porn that happens but

1182
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,070
they forget ever so if you report that

1183
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,990
you get you get a quick win in a red

1184
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,660
team back in boot bulldust if you find

1185
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:08,339
that your target has acquired a smaller

1186
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,390
software house a software house maybe

1187
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:15,090
build at all like last that client so

1188
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:17,009
look at a java-based application if you

1189
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,440
can access that they're all that reverse

1190
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,780
engineer you might find this got

1191
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,539
who did his net leverage those keys you

1192
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,549
log into an external facing servers

1193
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:26,390
you're you're already in the network

1194
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:28,609
you'll be faster

1195
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,859
you need to enter that majority in so

1196
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:32,180
you've got your food then you put your

1197
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:33,529
asset discovery so you're looking at

1198
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,868
your IP blocks you're looking at the

1199
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:38,780
clothes the clothes has been used as a

1200
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:40,130
bug bit a buzzword for as long as I can

1201
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,380
remember but it's becoming more and more

1202
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:45,319
popular you find expose things like

1203
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,359
Cuban air you spawn those the oceans you

1204
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:50,529
have them exposed on Azure

1205
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,180
EWS all sorts of stuff it a massive

1206
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:56,839
hangs last year the year before massive

1207
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:58,279
instance of exposed s3 buckets SD

1208
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,589
buckets being a penis storage the idea

1209
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,359
of each AWS users and a lot of people

1210
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:05,180
were leaving would be sensitive

1211
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:07,098
just exposed zero to st doctor means or

1212
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,618
whatever we've access to lots of stuff

1213
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:11,059
that's a finding show in a POC hunt

1214
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,950
that's a lot of information straight

1215
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:15,380
when ready so you can imagine that way

1216
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,730
that you put the enumeration so not only

1217
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,530
are you doing something enumeration

1218
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,000
you're also looking at at look who is

1219
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,770
blue pups finding people who have

1220
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,839
registered domains there's there's

1221
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:27,140
commercial tools that the other do it

1222
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,720
and they'll drawn through everything

1223
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,118
that saying your your who is records who

1224
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,500
and kuwait similar surf you've

1225
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,510
registered domain and you've got your

1226
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,740
your name is the the contact that will

1227
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,599
control through evidence got that

1228
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,689
contact point domains you can sometimes

1229
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,910
find like unknown acquisitions that way

1230
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,279
you've gotta wear sense your style using

1231
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:48,109
google that were using linked and

1232
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,910
fashion you've got all those things he

1233
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:51,950
had never really in scope so solution it

1234
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,700
here and it's never ask open the pocket

1235
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:57,140
it's more it's more in scope of items

1236
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,828
now you were tooling examples submission

1237
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,299
that previously

1238
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:01,329
google was probably the biggest tool

1239
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:03,559
that most people will use in a pen test

1240
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:05,059
the probably isn't erecting the poison

1241
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:06,740
upon code if you don't know something

1242
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:09,950
 google it because it's probably

1243
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:11,538
got the answer and my my mom is a prime

1244
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,430
example she lose her to use do because

1245
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,529
she's just a see exactly what's an event

1246
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,750
and it comes back some people are like I

1247
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:20,690
did a type of paragraph out

1248
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:23,089
that's how you use it but like to end

1249
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,289
what you want the answer you put in your

1250
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:28,180
question and it'll probably get

1251
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:28,180
something back just don't Google bondage

1252
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:34,720
historical discovery two sites go about

1253
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,670
discovery these three tools written by

1254
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,759
amin amin on that guy

1255
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:41,320
it works for i think he works for skybet

1256
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,990
about the hero he's written loads of

1257
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,360
tools on his github hey we back your

1258
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:48,100
elves you feed it a list of your elves

1259
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,470
it will go away and it will crawl

1260
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,900
archive the art and wayback machine and

1261
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:55,959
look for any paths that are that it

1262
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:58,300
paints then if you paper into you are

1263
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,880
interesting what it will do is it will

1264
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,530
look for a potential aram I return puts

1265
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,540
in those URLs so you might have

1266
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,890
thousands tens of thousands of pathway

1267
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,050
of we're at your ocean I'll get into

1268
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,390
that you find well actually there's PHP

1269
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:12,340
info here infinite exposed or there's ie

1270
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,049
was one all that's wonderful to SQL

1271
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,880
injection and then you've got a whole

1272
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:18,280
world of fun well he was also talking

1273
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,960
about that he's got a video on YouTube

1274
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,250
it's over an hour long talk favorite

1275
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,820
reconnaissance and it's great you

1276
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,430
should go watch it

1277
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,680
l might be trained tweet earlier he

1278
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,810
talked the HTTP broad but I've never

1279
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,319
used before and I used it recently where

1280
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:34,540
you basically have you got your Alex you

1281
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,750
find that there's thousands of domains

1282
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,009
something might not be lines so you if

1283
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,990
you use something like iOS you can go to

1284
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,670
a screenshot line but what is tht probe

1285
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:46,089
will do is it'll scan them for eighteen

1286
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,650
forty straight away it will like a list

1287
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,240
alone if they're about URL and then you

1288
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,070
can use that the attack useful for

1289
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,959
reading useful from programming there's

1290
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:55,050
new tooling all the time if you follow

1291
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,340
read it you fall Twitter

1292
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,410
telegram there's lots of different

1293
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,890
platforms if you follow the hashtag blog

1294
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,859
burning

1295
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,930
there's tweets going every scene of new

1296
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,030
tools new ways of finding bugs things

1297
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,069
like a template injection for example

1298
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,020
and projection was demonstrated by James

1299
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,370
Kato a piece of Manchester last year or

1300
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,560
the year before which is a way of

1301
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,940
exploiting legit it was phone from doing

1302
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,070
bug burnings and it's now being

1303
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,780
leveraged and like it's been leveraged

1304
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,600
and pen test it's been leveraged in like

1305
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,910
threat actors are using it in certain

1306
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,069
scenarios there's other tools so like

1307
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,950
all the the reconnaissance based killing

1308
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:32,080
that is being found like it's been

1309
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,669
developed for specific specifically bug

1310
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,650
hunting but no can be transparent and

1311
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:39,160
used for reading it can be used for pen

1312
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,430
deathly it's the multi faceted but

1313
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,609
tooling is

1314
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:46,580
 useful then you've got my kind

1315
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:50,080
of favourites laid up in love Comic Sans

1316
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:53,509
everyone hates it you guys

1317
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,040
essentially each each of these souls a

1318
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,990
different problem and if they have

1319
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,060
differences that they have similarities

1320
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,890
red teaming you're testing a defensive

1321
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,680
capability talk about is your very

1322
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:05,960
security approach within a wider school

1323
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,089
i've heart thought about it socially

1324
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,770
here typically have scope and but

1325
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,050
everything else jail in school pen

1326
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:14,060
testing it's the yellow one here so it's

1327
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:16,850
here they're finding fun about these in

1328
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:19,490
a time-based scope it's usually quite

1329
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,960
closed it's usually won't choose the

1330
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,160
chat bar sometimes you do get fun paint

1331
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,840
a slide about a copper a lot of

1332
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,480
appearing card details but like there's

1333
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,520
a ten it's clear compliance based it's a

1334
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,190
very fast moving and changing market so

1335
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,930
 bunnies is not painting it they're

1336
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:36,050
not the same thing and their thing is

1337
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:37,339
not about it if you if you if you're

1338
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,410
doing pen testing you're not doing pop

1339
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:42,170
bunny pen testing isn't red teaming it's

1340
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:44,509
not bug buddy and some companies both so

1341
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,550
your red team it's actually I've been

1342
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:49,510
under yo thanks for listening to me is

1343
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,510
there any questions

1344
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:04,249

1345
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,249
