230
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:56,699

231
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:59,469
finished the live quest

232
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,669

website its across and the layers of

234
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:06,850
quest so the important that we were

235
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:11,829
reminded off there is let's ride used to

236

237
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:16,479
closing a bunch of roads around the area

238
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:20,410
as far as we can tell looking at the

239
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,149
maps they're not closing a room a Rundle

240
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,429
gates and furnivall street which are the

two outs here the two main ones and they

242
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:28,779
certainly not closing down by the

243
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,179
