53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:23,659

the bear farmers do apologize for that

57
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,430
didn't expect that one minute oh this is

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,720
our last talk of the year in terms of

59
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,520
things we've got planned we may be

60
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,590
talking elsewhere but we don't know

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,419
about it yet but we thought it'd be a

62
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,210
good opportunity to showcase some new

63
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,170
material so some of the topics that we

64
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,150
talked about today

65
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,200
you'll be familiar with because you pay

66
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,409
attention to what's happening on the

67
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,450
circle media you read the news you

68
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,220
probably see a shit post a lot because

69
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,750
we shipped a lot of course the meeting

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,580
shit but we're going to talk about it in

71
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,050
a slightly different way so the topic

72
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,159
today is around fear uncertainty and

73
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,020
doubt good so quick intros really quick

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,490
we're wasting court on now luring me

75
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,770
hiccupping bad IT and I'm like I run a

76
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,850
night security team up in the north of

77
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,219
England working for and I speak irate

78
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:33,440
assertive emails there try not to offend

79
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:36,610
special snowflakes sure I'm showing you

80
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,300
shouting at devs

81
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,420
and I swear

82
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:45,860
basically we never actually tell anybody

83
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,360
what we do do it there's our bear

84
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,330
farmers Twitter handle and we've got a

85
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,220
website which is not fun hackable let's

86
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,500
get out there before somebody else does

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,249
it thank good security banquets military

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,899
rates our military groups we're going

89
00:05:56,249 --> 00:06:07,309
ai machine-learning we've got a sniffer

90
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:09,929
dog keys my keys it might not be milk

91
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:12,029
calcium so important when you get older

92
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:18,899
because your bones will break for no

93
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:21,089
reason whatsoever also we do have the

94
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:25,039
emergency laptop destruction system

95
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:27,839
enabled so so somebody mentioned the

96
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,119
picture of the screen and one she's

97
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,709
picture that in contacts to a

98
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,899
conversation to having just outside

99
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,279
they're all about Simon Smith Savin

100
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:40,379
Smith inventing sad security in

101
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:42,299
Australia but he look very well now yeah

102
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,699
I think so the latest that I have on him

103
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:47,818
is he's actually been banned from suing

104
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,499
people by the Australian courts and in

105
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,110
addition to that he was basically

106
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:54,059
ordered that if he does try to sue

107
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,459
somebody they will consider it contempt

108
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:58,619
of court and he will probably either get

109
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,419
fined heavily or thrown in jail if you

110
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,669
don't know about the investigator I

111
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:06,839
highly recommend that you follow him for

112
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:09,089
pure comedic value i mike sent me an

113
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,899
actual radio interview with this guy and

114
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:14,909
he's like completely off completely

115
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,709
unhinged it's unbelievable

116
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:23,729
what Scott's unhinged and then descends

117
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:24,899
from that I know at least one other

118
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,248
person in the room that's not a bear

119
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:31,399
farm that's heard that all and he's

120
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:31,399
looking at his phone right now Scott

121
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,449
alright so let's break down the concepts

122
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,269
of food fear is the idea that you you

123
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:43,399
are emotionally aroused use that word by

124
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:45,629
threat of danger or pain or arm okay

125
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,639
uncertainty is not being entirely sure

126
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:49,979
about a course of action or or or a

127
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,199
thing in your head which leads you is

128
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,508
essentially in this and now we just

129
00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:00,749
picture here take one path or the other

130
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:03,449
welcome to the grip then and then doubt

131
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:05,879
is when you something real or is it

132
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,159
something fake not entirely shorts at

133
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,690
least these three things combined can

134
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,640
lead you to make

135
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,400
often an incorrect choice in life

136
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,690
whether you're on the receiving end of a

137
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,310
phishing email or a scale where email

138
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,840
that's telling you that they've got

139
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,270
copies of your webcam and you've been

140
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:31,049
looking at poor online this is all an

141
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:33,840
example again okay just FUD is used

142
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,640
frequently as a marketing tactic to and

143
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,440
I think we're going to talk about that a

144
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,240
little bit yeah that image there is

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,370
doubting Thomas so he didn't believe

146
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,960
that Jesus could have arisen there is

147
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,760
where the Apostles don't you believe in

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,040
Jesus if you believe in years or the

149
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,550
devs of bid fight of the day these are

150
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,900
available yes sir Jesus proved that he

151
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:59,939
had risen from the dead by allowing

152
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:04,949
Thomas - okay so anybody know what film

153
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:08,390
that's a quote from fantastic it never

154
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:12,180
gets said in that bill okay

155
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:14,340
it's not it's often believed to be the

156
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,199
part where Neos directly in the room by

157
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,600
Morpheus and the other blue red bell

158
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,390
discussion it doesn't happen it never

159
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,790
got said so I think it's the bundela

160
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,680
reflect that is an example of where the

161
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,900
message gets perpetuated it's actually

162
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,540
bullshit people then begin to believe it

163
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,910
it becomes institutional believe okay

164
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,390
it's okay bullshit a couple of exhibits

165
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,439
incoming again you will be familiar with

166
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,730
Graff you do these things because we

167
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:45,150
actively get involved in some of the

168
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:46,740
rage and some of the debate so some so

169
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,300
quick show hounds we like to do show of

170
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,890
hands things how common show of hands

171
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,170
this year has been Facebook what we're

172
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,990
not talking about those guys today who's

173
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,829
familiar with this oh this is gonna be

174
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,780
good that's great because hopefully a

175
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,140
lot to talk about will million resonate

176
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:10,920
with you so shout out what is the

177
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:18,150
trigger word with this thing I've got my

178
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:22,490
voice back weird thing yeah that's the

179
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,490
GBH beginning to kick in I do

180
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:30,350
okay yeah the trigger word is unhackable

181
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,420
pen it's food for other people in detox

182
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,840
engaging in social media because nothing

183
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,880
is impactful the example here the pit

184
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,370
fly claim is that there the device is

185
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,500
practically a rock how actually

186
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,750
practically as much use as a rock as far

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,340
as I'm concerned they even service and

188
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,780
they said pretty much the same sort of

189
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,860
thing around October last year bit by

190
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,630
emerging as a brand new organization

191
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,790
with an unhackable cryptocurrency wallet

192
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,260
calling it on alcohol and that was a red

193
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,599
rag to a bull juice in the security

194
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,300
community because nothing there was a

195
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,130
red rag to a bull to me because I

196
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,760
commonly near old spaces and it was a

197
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,740
red rug as a ball too clever security

198
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,330
fee and if you want to tell us about how

199
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,180
some of your colleagues got involved in

200
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,130
so there was a collective called the

201
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,900
Jazz or a camper oh so this is a big

202
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,450
factor Collective mistakenly known as

203
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,930
cyber Gibbons also sometimes somehow

204
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:30,200
call oversee yes that one and the ascent

205
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,430
essentially took a bit by the the

206
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,840
snowbound bet players there was an

207
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,160
unhackable in the debug button even

208
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,680
they'd put like I think as a half a

209
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,329
million dollars worth of Bitcoin on a

210
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,510
bet if I wallet and two and throw into a

211
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,330
tldr

212
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,220
hackable very hackable and it's an

213
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,980
Android device it runs a media tape

214
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,380
chipset a couple guys that work with

215
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,690
myself took our part found out you could

216
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,700
run do one it for example do lots of

217
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,910
different things then they came back

218
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,040
this year very recently and basically

219
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,660
went right so yeah we've fixed all the

220
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,670
problems but it's definitely not an

221
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,219
Android device definitely not fun and

222
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,900
then cyber governs and I feel like eyes

223
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,100
took it apart I went actually the SIM

224
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,380
card slot first thing you're saying it's

225
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,090
not forward oh well maybe you know it

226
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,010
with not an Android device linear we

227
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,650
have routed it we've run all this stuff

228
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,450
on it and it's actually if you go into

229
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,459
her and so just search for a hashtag bit

230
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,740
fire there's like a thread this this

231
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,320
white span over it two or three months

232
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,050
though and it's just constant the CTO is

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,800
convinced that we don't know what the

234
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,000
fuck you're talking about

235
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,050
and

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,370
but we don't so the current city because

237
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,979
the current see - yes so that they've

238
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:43,519
got through a lot of CEOs and and McAfee

239
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,560
was quite a big was he advocate for it

240
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,819
being unhackable and he loves his bath

241
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,560
salts so yeah we got a chiropodist the

242
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:55,279
other thing we're good buyers they were

243
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,378
pen tested the bellwether but and then I

244
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,420
turned out there were grains currently

245
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,670
being painted and then it turns out that

246
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,439
no such thing actually ever happened so

247
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,009
the the contacted the company called

248
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,980
celebrate

249
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,920
who me forensic normal place houses

250
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,040
tubes apparently they contact them to

251
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,040
like the security test of it and the CTO

252
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,360
of celebrate jumped on far away he

253
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,610
called this up and what we just laughed

254
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,689
and off the phone yeah so that was

255
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,009
always going to happen given the bad

256
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:35,240
press that these guys had already had

257
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:36,939
traction so a word on the PR and who in

258
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:44,120
the right mind would want John McAfee

259
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:47,750
supporting well that's why what probably

260
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:51,699
he got in mind stately unhackable you do

261
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,699
what picking he invented cybersecurity

262
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:59,959
so he came out as a fully full support

263
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,699
fully behind it right Bradley was more

264
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,469
pedaling cryptocurrency as a concept

265
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,479
think that was really his motivation

266
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:14,509
behind it you know buy a Bitcoin wallet

267
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:16,519
so currency wallet yeah so exploit

268
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,100
expose and expand the market and then

269
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,689
sell you shit raised they became

270
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,279
incredibly aggressive throughout the

271
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,509
whole thing and we can put it down at

272
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,459
many things I've got a few thoughts

273
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:29,480
about what may have made his new change

274
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:30,979
I think the current activity of him

275
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,470
trying to run for president of the

276
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,750
United States is somewhat I'm gonna see

277
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,120
impacted by the sudden darkness of this

278
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,480
Twitter account followed by taunting of

279
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,740
the DOJ while also trying to run for

280
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,570
president so there is a few

281
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,640
little inconsistencies I would say in

282
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,280
his approach and also on the run for

283
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,380
bidding tax so yeah

284
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,920
and then personal social media number

285
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,080
one oh yeah it's Australian all my Jets

286
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:06,089
total security yep well in his own words

287
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:08,760
I quote I been fucking cyber security he

288
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,080
does not stir when when with a man that

289
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,980
was worse not know best

290
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,510
yeah and in the end he backed off the

291
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,120
other that power is running for us

292
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:23,270
presently there are examples running

293
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,270
from the US government police may be

294
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:35,730
shooting more up with machine guns with

295
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:37,650
his pals engaging in sexual ok so here

296
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,600
are a few examples on about that and if

297
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,550
we can get it to actually work and

298
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,770
incentive it sexual intercourse but

299
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,689
mammals or choose whales oh yeah Fox

300
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,970
leather and you can remember in you

301
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,800
orbit it was at Fein the model so here

302
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,540
are a couple of examples of how terrible

303
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,430
the PR from their hit by themselves has

304
00:15:51,540 --> 00:16:00,030
been so on the left hand side there in

305
00:15:53,430 --> 00:16:01,520
my way that's essentially saying that

306
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:06,990
bit by users are in that particular

307
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,699
percentile alike you there you go so

308
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,040
only the clever kids have got a bit by

309
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,510
everyone else is retarded that's what

310
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,300
they say and they weren't even ashamed

311
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:19,890
of it who won't show you other examples

312
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:22,290
of well there's the example of an

313
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,850
attorney and one of the many dialogues

314
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,790
he's had bit by and then John McAfee

315
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,650
weighing in how am I want to be again

316
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,530
then it's obscurity get you fucking

317
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,600
facts right something that we listed

318
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,810
earlier on which was a little montage of

319
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,550
things I put out which was around their

320
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,219
claims of one half of also there is in

321
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,810
text you can't miss it and then they're

322
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,460
removing we are removing than half of

323
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,859
all because of course it suits on Apple

324
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,110
but then this thing here and apologies

325
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,410
if it sets anybody but it's important

326
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,330
quite up crassness of these people just

327
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,010
prior to Christmas

328
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,910
2018 if I thought it was entirely

329
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,350
appropriate

330
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,910
that message out that if you don't know

331
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,040
Bitcoin you can make R an actual suicide

332
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,649
now that's the shit message to put out

333
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,210
but anytime right but just before

334
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,920
Christmas if we're done of the classic

335
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,770
example of how conditioned these people

336
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,240
actually are so they'll never be

337
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,740
forgiven they'll never be forgiven for

338
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,750
any of the crap technology they've tried

339
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,040
to ram down people's hopes they'll never

340
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,460
be forgiven for getting gauging the

341
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,690
idiot

342
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,670
caffeine part of their marketing

343
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,620
campaign and they'll certainly never be

344
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,690
forgiven for messages like that put out

345
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,339
so when you saw before you pick up in

346
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:31,320
before when we talked about celebrate

347
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:36,389
socially let's shit like this is say

348
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:40,169
yeah oh yeah yeah the narcissists up

349
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:42,570
professional awesome hey so this this

350
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:45,210
image is a really difficult one for me

351
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,350
because we've lost some really good

352
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:51,450
people in our community Aaron Schwartz

353
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,980
is a great example of the gentleman who

354
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,590
downloaded a whole bunch of public

355
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,820
documents or was aggressively prosecuted

356
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:01,230
to the point where the darkness

357
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:04,020
descended into committed suicide mental

358
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,460
health and mental health advocates in

359
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,250
our community are doing an outstanding

360
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,750
job and bringing a lot of stuff to light

361
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,390
that's really difficult for a lot of

362
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,060
people out there I have some thoughts

363
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,670
about why it's so difficult but well as

364
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,580
we get into the presentation I'll come

365
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,570
out on those subjects but I just want to

366
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,250
say this you're in a job depending on

367
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,189
what type of cybersecurity job you're

368
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:33,180
doing you're in war without end and war

369
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:36,540
is demoralizing war is difficult war has

370
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,370
an effect on you as a person and I'm not

371
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,530
going to belittle those that do suffer

372
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,050
from post-traumatic stress disorder as a

373
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,980
result of military or police service or

374
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:49,649
paramedics or fire but I will say this

375
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,320
we are in a very stressful job many of

376
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,140
us deal with negative subjects when the

377
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,629
phone rings and it's a cybersecurity

378
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,430
incident it is not usually hey good news

379
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,240
the website is totally up and running

380
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,620
it's so awesome

381
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,420
okay so support each other the biggest

382
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,399
message I'm going to leave you with the

383
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,559
social media is if there are important

384
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,320
discussions to have Twitter is not

385
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:16,570
okay we need to have panels on the

386
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,580
issues that we have for mental health to

387
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,710
diversity to all of the other demons

388
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,399
that haunt us in this in this industry

389
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,740
but absolutely please don't think about

390
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,600
the darkness and think about us as

391
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,460
support you can reach out to any beer

392
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,668
farmer you can reach out to any public

393
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,100
security researcher that has twit it

394
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:38,590
that is available on Twitter or you can

395
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,820
join us on the many hots Club there is

396
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,789
an outlet okay

397
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:54,370
don't feel like you're abandoned yeah

398
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:56,799
yeah okay sure that's it so so these

399
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,678
guys was actually joining he put out a

400
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,658
tweet when I was around but it was

401
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,179
something certificate Lee related and

402
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:07,960
these guys jumped on and kind of thread

403
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:10,179
jacked the tweet and they in in it they

404
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,100
put 10 reasons why let's encrypt

405
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:17,620
certificates on good and I went through

406
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,168
each or each one of those 10 reasons and

407
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:24,520
are discredited every single one of

408
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:27,520
those 10 reasons now this is we're using

409
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,590
false information for your own marketing

410
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,620
gain kind of grant crosses that line

411
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:35,500
even further we're trying to bring down

412
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,678
a company or organization that you feel

413
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:43,630
the threat but letting belittling them

414
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:46,780
with invalid facts there were some let's

415
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:50,020
just say wording in there the

416
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:53,168
infographic whatever they had that work

417
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:56,918
was not thinking of the right wording

418
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,460
that wouldn't get her back but it's not

419
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,480
accurate

420
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:06,250
basically the heading was infringing on

421
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:09,190
a trade more at the end of the day they

422
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,650
were saying the certificates the weak

423
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,840
certificates was as a result for the

424
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,120
British Airways attack which we all know

425
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,100
is absolutely rubbish and the British

426
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,350
Airways hack happened because of the

427
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,780
mage part injected JavaScript it had

428
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,780
nothing to do with the certificate so

429
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,059
do I use fear dine use of certainty and

430
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:34,209
onion starts and especially don't use it

431
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:36,010
to transcend your competitors because

432
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,840
you're gonna make yourself a whistle I

433
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,899
have another example of this just the

434
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,279
other day I got a LinkedIn marketing

435
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:48,129
thing that said that that that one

436
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:52,390
hundred thirty six million dollar fine

437
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:55,120
for BA was due to a phishing email and

438
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:59,470
I'm like no you are wrong

439
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,779
sir and this is the thing is that well

440
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,120
then it then the answer was well you

441
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:07,149
should be you know you should be fishing

442
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,850
your own employees anyways true but

443
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:14,500
don't tell me something it's completely

444
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,879
false in your marketing Sean said don't

445
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,409
tell us that the British Airways happens

446
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,440
you to assert what it was you to supply

447
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:22,570
poisoning yeah most important you don't

448
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,470
tell a security professional other stuff

449
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,970
because they're gonna know you're

450
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,539
talking rather straight away yeah

451
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,970
especially if they read the BBC News

452
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,080
simple as that actually and don't tell

453
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,520
everybody that extended validation

454
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,139
certificates are actually going to make

455
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,320
you more secure than not using them

456
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,679
because it's bullshit it's got such a

457
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,720
straight answer

458
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,740
see so it's a bad extended validation

459
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,419
certificate so they don't know it it's

460
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,640
extra as a name suggests extra

461
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:51,460
validation performed on top of their

462
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,899
certificate to validate whoever's

463
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,669
requesting that should own it but

464
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:56,559
there's kind of issues around there

465
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:59,169
because they focus on the organization

466
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,570
now the certain organizations which have

467
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,760
a totally different trading name to the

468
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,470
actual sites connecting so you're going

469
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,169
to have to require the user to try it

470
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,559
hey is this site says inside my PayPal

471
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:13,899
for example is company a well that

472
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:18,460
doesn't match how do I know it's valid

473
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:23,168
browsers also removing the extra bit the

474
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:25,510
build that's showing up there from from

475
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:27,490
the URL bar so there's no longer

476
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,500
distinction between the two yeah and the

477
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,690
other thing I've seen standard

478
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,440
validation equals more secure because

479
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,360
better encryption in corrects I can have

480
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,919
extended valid a

481
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,479
certificate with my encryption if I

482
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,539
using our sophistry so they're totally

483
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,309
unrelated again this comes down to use

484
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,799
the fax if you're going to market

485
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:49,110
something use the correct facts saw your

486
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,990
product on what it should be and not

487
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,570
it's all simple food yeah and a couple

488
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,519
of more things for me about this as you

489
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,500
mentioned that the major browser vendors

490
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,549
now we're stopping caring about Amy okay

491
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,250
you're going to stop seeing it as a

492
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:04,500
thing the green bar doing ship whatever

493
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,970
you can see up there that's gonna go I

494
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,720
think in mobile browsers you've not been

495
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,720
able to see it for ages

496
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,678
Scott's got a pointer out let's remove

497
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,600
the scheme and tell you anything the

498
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,340
scheme and the padlock are there then

499
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,889
just have the padlock gonna telling you

500
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,980
the telling you the same thing I'm not

501
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:26,549
telling you I like my checkmark my

502
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,100
semantic on my website right there

503
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:31,230
yeah so one thing to add that there's a

504
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,289
fear on the other side moving towards

505
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:38,130
the secure web I Sonny HTTP is gonna

506
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:40,320
stop working nice you'll get a error but

507
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,240
HTTP will still work it's up to the user

508
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,470
to decide whether they want to continue

509
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,679
or not yeah a my last point is around

510
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:51,779
domain warranty again so again but X

511
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,919
pounds you can spend money on a thing

512
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:54,360
that you'll never need you'll never

513
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,980
really understand what you get back for

514
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,229
your money never cover your any shit in

515
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,049
first place so don't do that

516
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,460
avoid evie avoid domain warranty the

517
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,080
people selling domain or I can't even

518
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,130
tell you ways for what it does so what

519
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
you get back from it if you have a

520
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,250
problem that can't explain the problems

521
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,980
you might experience and the guy explain

522
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,690
how the refund you so run a mile from it

523
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,960
if you don't take it when I was taking

524
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:20,940
people like Scott use SSL v3 is like

525
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,679
competing so we've got we've got a

526
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,480
couple of slides on the on the

527
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,889
revolutionary technological approaches

528
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,289
that we're seeing more and more of now

529
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:30,330
to solve you problem you security

530
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:32,429
problems because vendors take your

531
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,129
security seriously right as much as we

532
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,480
take security seriously more until

533
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,669
they're hacked and find and then they

534
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,799
take it really seriously like a lot more

535
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:42,269
serious than they originally tried to

536
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,918
make like Morrison so I got an email

537
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:45,330
from recently who obviously we take your

538
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,669
security of really Sears they're the

539
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,460
Fastlane saying oh no we haven't been

540
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,980
breached we just think we might in

541
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,690
you get breached it's like okay then I

542
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,360
mean there's I've been proactive at

543
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,130
least very serious little very but it's

544
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,360
not just it's not just the technology

545
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:04,010
and security vendors that can you

546
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,020
receive an email once you've immediate

547
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,049
reaction to that mine has put on Twitter

548
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,840
what the fuck yeah but other people than

549
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:15,379
you look at that VR shit Horace's a

550
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,730
beverage yeah well the answer lies in

551
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,679
the blockchain it's become almost a

552
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:22,340
parody of itself the blockchain in the

553
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:24,049
last 18 months probably and because the

554
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,520
answer is the blockchain in many things

555
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,889
you vendor will say that we've got this

556
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:33,379
new security thing post on the other and

557
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:35,419
it's salute bollocks

558
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,059
we're on to the next gen blockchain that

559
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:40,909
the dark watching that blockchain Kevin

560
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:44,178
robot invented that three vendors today

561
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:46,220
so we got Simon Smith invent inside

562
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:49,730
security in Australia John McAfee John

563
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,049
McAfee inventing sub security . they got

564
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,029
to get together those two guys to flash

565
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:56,629
that one out and kept them on even in

566
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:59,539
dark objects so we're pushing it but

567
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,610
just 3m blockchain does have its place

568
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:03,169
but in there are contexts on the road

569
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,168
users so this wasn't that big a

570
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:08,120
blockchain saying it's totally worthless

571
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:10,220
technology it has its place use it

572
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,928
appropriately you don't just throw it in

573
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,130
there because it's a buzzword it's not a

574
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:14,840
dig at blockchain it's and look at the

575
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,490
people that tell you they will solve

576
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:22,070
your problem without telling you a what

577
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:23,960
the problem is it's solving and well

578
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,439
maybe it's not explore a bit smaller X

579
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,850
again so I've been to conferences where

580
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,760
antivirus product vendors have told us

581
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,199
all about their next gen solution to

582
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,610
Soaring email bypass our caller caster

583
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,679
and they're telling us it's a next-gen

584
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,330
solution but when you dig into it it's

585
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,230
signature-based technologies so they are

586
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,580
not moved technology on in any way shape

587
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,820
but it's been claimed as next yet

588
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,678
because guess what it's marking yeah I'm

589
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,928
gonna point out this so there's a

590
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,940
firewall vendor out there that try to

591
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:55,580
invent something called fifth-generation

592
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,909
cyber threat any of you guys

593
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:02,040
yeah right so so they go to market right

594
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:04,410
and and this is how slimy they were and

595
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,300
beau-line grossly the dog on twitter

596
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,600
called the mode on this because what

597
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,220
they did is they created a wikipedia

598
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,980
article about fifth generation cyber

599
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,350
threat and it was actually they didn't

600
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,170
even like disguised the fact of who was

601
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,550
editing the actual wikipedia article

602
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,830
that they put up on this fifth

603
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,960
generation cyber threat and it was like

604
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,689
attributed to a guy in the marketing

605
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,870
department of the firewall vendor so

606
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:33,540
again like this is the pure fun right

607
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:36,899
it was undefined it was words that they

608
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:40,500
somehow put together and it just baffles

609
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,540
me because do I need is my fourth

610
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,340
generation firewall going to protect

611
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,580
against the fifth generation or do I

612
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:50,699
have to go fourth generation yeah and

613
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,320
and do it by that component and then is

614
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,000
it going to be next year the sixth

615
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,770
generation in which case I've got to

616
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,540
upgrade what a swift generation not

617
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,470
block third generation attacks because

618
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:06,450
he doesn't know what they are in law

619
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:09,600
that's right that's a huge point so shit

620
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,270
robot they're broken robot but again a I

621
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,480
am intelligence of machine learning

622
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,100
I used relentlessly that's part of

623
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,200
campaigns to get you to buy a product it

624
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,070
solves a problem you've not got all that

625
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:28,320
you don't understand well enough

626
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:29,909
yourself yeah use it appropriately again

627
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,830
it comes down to the fact that this

628
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:35,400
technology especially machine learning

629
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,620
has its place it's has its uses but stop

630
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,160
throwing it in with everything as part

631
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,659
of marketing saw it the product rather

632
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,250
on what it can do to your hearts going

633
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,350
to solve your problem the existing

634
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,820
problems don't make new problems that's

635
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,480
another thing that some vendors

636
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,490
sometimes do I you have this problem no

637
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't I got this problem you need this

638
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,620
product to solve it let people decide

639
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,110
for themselves give them the information

640
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,469
they need to and then let them make that

641
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:07,530
decision is the way I have professor

642
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,600
purchases so I was in Dubai on a panel

643
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,639
was the most uncomfortable panel I've

644
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,310
ever been on there is a Saudi prince

645
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,480
right and there is a the Chief of Police

646
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,490
of do

647
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,740
and they're talking about artificial

648
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,330
intelligence you know how they can find

649
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,330
I don't know journalists or whatever

650
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,519
yeah you guys got that didn't you

651
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:31,440
but anyways so I get in there and I'm

652
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,779
like this is kind of all us like I'm

653
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,570
gonna call it out and say hey I doesn't

654
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:39,630
exist yet no computer has gained

655
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:42,299
sentience right all we have is advanced

656
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,490
pattern matching right we don't really

657
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,980
have a sentient life-form and I can't

658
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,500
wake up in the morning and tell Alexia

659
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,269
or Google secure all my things

660
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,059
even though Google might know exactly

661
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:55,649
what all my things are right but the

662
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,480
point is is that we haven't reached that

663
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,610
point so every time I hear the words

664
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,620
aren't official intelligence I just kind

665
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,658
of lose my shit over it because it

666
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,449
doesn't exist what a prime example is I

667
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,919
use google coffee in my car I tried to

668
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,779
text even though we don't it was like

669
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,250
enjoyed to send the Hellespont disaster

670
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:13,250
but no that's not why I was texting I

671
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:18,480
don't think it's it's been around a long

672
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:20,879
time but it's not mature enough to trust

673
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,820
in the way that we're told we shouldn't

674
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:29,850
be trusting it so you know let's talk

675
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,559
about zero days yeah so a big issue that

676
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,469
we have in our community is really

677
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:36,418
around responsible disclosure

678
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,049
coordinated disclosure or fuck it I'm

679
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:42,690
just putting it out on Twitter right now

680
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:44,879
what we've seen is a lot of carnage has

681
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,250
happened and it's a very divisive issue

682
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,409
and I think that you know there are

683
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,059
arguments on both sides of this but

684
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:54,059
coming back to the person that's

685
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,690
involved right let's think about sandbox

686
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,070
escaper

687
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,649
let's think about somebody that

688
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:01,889
obviously has got some mental challenges

689
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:04,229
who feel so alone and so persecuted that

690
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,908
they want to sell Windows zero-days to

691
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,090
the enemies of the Western nations

692
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:10,679
calling out the FBI and the DOJ is not

693
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,840
probably the most constructive thing you

694
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,549
can do in your cybersecurity career it

695
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,100
could end rather quickly

696
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:24,570
like mr. Birmingham mr. Javed Hussain

697
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:27,850
remember ya trick from Team poison who

698
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:30,129
got eliminated because he was part

699
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:33,699
cyber caliphate so there are

700
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:37,059
consequences to dropping o days in some

701
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:42,280
cases the motivation is my own personal

702
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:45,490
PR Ormandy or perhaps more insidious

703
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,010
types of 0 days that are drop but having

704
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:51,190
said that I want to get your opinion on

705
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:54,340
this subject too because as a guy who is

706
00:32:51,190 --> 00:33:01,179
torturing Motorola for a while I think

707
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:03,039
you've got a lot to say on that it can't

708
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,020
kind of work two ways right you're gonna

709
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,620
engage with the company the company has

710
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,570
feedback they keep you in the loop great

711
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:14,139
that's where I say if you say hey I'm

712
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,520
going to do 90 days the end of that's

713
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,049
not approaching that realistically

714
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,120
companies have their own priorities

715
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,730
there's different factors that you have

716
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,590
to factor in there's all sorts of things

717
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,390
that you you have to think about so

718
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:27,158
simply saying 90 days often is not

719
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,140
viable yeah

720
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:30,610
the company is going to be working with

721
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,250
you if they're going to keep the

722
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,979
communication open sure if the company

723
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,780
says we'll fix it and you never hear

724
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,559
back from them well then maybe it's time

725
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:43,750
to drop that hammer it's not ideal it

726
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,080
should always be kind of a last resort

727
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,909
type thing so in my case with Motorola

728
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,960
contacted them about two or three times

729
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:57,190
I got the pushback or no it's not an

730
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,840
issue because you using secure Network

731
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,190
and all this kind of stuff which was not

732
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,080
true

733
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,330
and I try to explain to them why they

734
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,830
weren't correct and I got ignored so

735
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,510
eventually I write it up and actually

736
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,899
turns out that the issues that I found

737
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:13,929
were reported three years ago thankfully

738
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:16,449
after working with some someone who's

739
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:17,859
actually in the media there helped me

740
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,868
get in touch with somewhere in it at

741
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:23,020
Motorola and now there she's actually

742
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:26,020
resolved so for me that's not a that's a

743
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,820
win for the users and that's who you

744
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,940
should always be the focus of these

745
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,399
things not the company not the

746
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,200
researcher but actually uses the people

747
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,929
who matter are those people who can use

748
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,899
it so like for me I've tweeted recently

749
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,290
about the zoom stuff and I take it see

750
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:44,060
part because

751
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,610
at the end of the day the ones you're

752
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,159
suffering the most are the users so the

753
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:52,429
same thing you visit a site you could

754
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,830
accidentally hit a link in Saturn or

755
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,950
launch the new meeting inspiring you

756
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:00,500
essentially bad yes massive effects

757
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,490
certainly but the researcher went 90

758
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,250
days two weeks

759
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,049
hands up disclosed well now we have a

760
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,520
scenario where if you had installed

761
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,430
software you open a porosity

762
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,950
vulnerability and this is why we need to

763
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,060
do a responsible disclosure so things

764
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,399
can be tested

765
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,020
so if proper fix can be put in place

766
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,240
because guess what's going to happen

767
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,980
when I get for these people panic yeah

768
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,919
oh they're gonna spy on my camera

769
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:28,010
something and then we end up in the

770
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,480
worst officer situation yeah well I've

771
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,950
got two out the other night about this

772
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,680
because it was gonna piss me off a

773
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:35,720
little bit first

774
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,060
if the only alternatives in terms of

775
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,910
disclosure I'll report it to the vendor

776
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,440
and reported to the planet then it's

777
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,810
fucked up there's got to be an

778
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,460
alternative thing that a researcher can

779
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,230
do no matter what state of mind they're

780
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,110
in there needs to be an established

781
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,240
protocol with an organization supporting

782
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,580
it that's got some teeth to make sure

783
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,470
the vendors act and some teeth to make

784
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,360
sure that the vendor is penalized if

785
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,640
they don't act you get the problem fixed

786
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,410
my favorite is when the security

787
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,980
researcher it gets punched in the face

788
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,750
by the CTL that's my favorite well there

789
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,940
are to some extent so like when you find

790
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,430
mass on the verities sometimes you can

791
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,900
contact the local set do well find

792
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,669
responsibly this was it worth the bend

793
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,010
up yeah so in the case of a lot of stuff

794
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:21,350
a PPP if fun we have had people that we

795
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,410
have people to ncsc that's the nature of

796
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:26,509
shit puzzles cool little that's not

797
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,270
that's not well known about enough no

798
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:30,800
it's true thing and it's not globally on

799
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,450
internet yeah

800
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,700
to some what this paper is the example

801
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,379
classic example six Microsoft zero days

802
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,790
without fucking sick on the internet

803
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,190
there should have been something that

804
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,529
helped that happen in a completely

805
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,730
different way so she she was against

806
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,500
Microsoft though I don't think she would

807
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,060
have gone along responsible school she

808
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,790
was just like fuck you got his humping

809
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,290
so now he used that was just straight up

810
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,080
I'm dropping all these because we give a

811
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,390
fucking that's not just yet yeah and and

812
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,190
now

813
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:58,618
the thing is the toy is often difficult

814
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,390
to get hold of the right concept and

815
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,880
this is a common problem that we have I

816
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:07,319
find a vulnerability now who do I

817
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,329
contact and in my case when I reported

818
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,829
it it didn't go to the right people

819
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:12,990
sure there might be technical and that

820
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,569
but they didn't understand the issue

821
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,058
behind and the severity of the issue

822
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:21,210
that I was reporting once he got to the

823
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:23,490
correct contact advocate Flixster got

824
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:27,539
resolved and then their credit within a

825
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:29,490
few weeks so often it's a case of not

826
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,220
such that the company doesn't care that

827
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,839
it gets to the right person you can make

828
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,058
the decisions and the course do the

829
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,549
right thing in a showed up for Scott who

830
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:40,859
a couple years back helped me figure out

831
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:43,049
who to talk to and what to do about

832
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:45,569
something that I find well on than that

833
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:48,329
so it's all about our community folks

834
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:56,519
it's all about connecting surprisingly

835
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:59,390
small community something we need to

836
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:59,390
keep expanding it

837
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:06,569
dandy absolutely so it's falling apart

838
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,670
and basically said the / - I was saying

839
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:11,759
0% unemployment in cybersecurity

840
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,230
I was like well technically no because

841
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:15,329
there's a lot of people who aren't

842
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,680
graduating with degrees now who are not

843
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,630
actually in the industry yet who are

844
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,038
looking for a chemistry a lot of them

845
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,599
will be in this room right now

846
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,740
and the reason there are long us because

847
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,839
they're catching for the companies who

848
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,959
are in the vendor or not the sponsor to

849
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,730
look at get into the industry so it we

850
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,619
need to as I community build up our

851
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,730
pipeline in industry I want the time

852
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,829
move the light rate we want you to have

853
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,509
success but it's the age-old problem we

854
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:39,180
won't have cesspool always have fucking

855
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:41,670
Mickey Mouse to point all eleven years

856
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,899
of experience and a Charlie are we need

857
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,630
you to have ceh because you're gonna be

858
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,630
a pen tester who the fuck has ever uch

859
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:52,079
as a pen tester really unless you're up

860
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:54,299
the NSA may be the next slide yeah I

861
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,099
think yeah it kind of depends on what

862
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:58,380
your role is going to be the security

863
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:59,849
industry so if you're a defender and

864
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,160
you're working an organization like the

865
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:04,589
one I work in where we we handle all our

866
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,759
personal day and we're a nice people are

867
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:09,740
later then

868
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,800
scuri is mining at a risk level yeah at

869
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,819
the very top of the organisation so

870
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,319
certifications like sisters I'm a

871
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:17,150
probably more geared up to that kind of

872
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,980
environment whereas euro SC piece of

873
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,319
this world I'm all geared up to kind of

874
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:26,000
roll the undies involved so it's its

875
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:27,349
horses for courses okay in this is going

876
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,200
to talk about government's take a nice

877
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:32,990
curious I remember the NSA forced

878
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,180
everyone recently to strongly advise

879
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:38,118
everyone recently didn't yeah so I've

880
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:41,299
got an article coming out in the Sunday

881
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:44,569
Times a couple days and I say one very

882
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,200
radical thing and this is it so if you

883
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:49,220
asked cyber ventures who always has this

884
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,649
report on the growth of the

885
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:55,069
cybersecurity industry they say by like

886
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:58,099
2025 it's like one trillion dollar

887
00:39:55,069 --> 00:40:01,069
industry so I got to thinking what

888
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:04,670
government would put a 1 trillion dollar

889
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:07,220
driver of the economy arrest so what

890
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,349
does that mean it means the government's

891
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:12,049
are not abdicating their responsibility

892
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:16,010
to protect any data including company's

893
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:19,430
data because the incentive is to put a

894
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:22,190
whole bunch of us unemployed out there

895
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:25,160
and guess what we'll turn to a life of

896
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:29,240
crime right to feed our families so my

897
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,220
view is that the government has to

898
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:35,689
tolerate a certain level of cybercrime

899
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:37,939
to keep the us that cyber defenders at

900
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,720
work you see this is it's like a snake

901
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,069
that's eating its own tail so one of the

902
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,520
biggest problems that we have right now

903
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:50,240
is we just got this amazing four billion

904
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:53,089
dollar fine against Facebook because of

905
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,819
the Cambridge analytical situation right

906
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:58,690
and the misuse of a bunch of personal

907
00:40:55,819 --> 00:41:02,119
private data we saw VA and Mariette um

908
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:06,109
you know get big big fines where's that

909
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,430
money go no one's talked about okay what

910
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:09,680
are we gonna do with all that money

911
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:15,980
right I personally think they should

912
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:17,600
spend it on the NHS yeah well there's

913
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,600
interestingly they

914
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,880
two things the the two organizations ba

915
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,529
America have been issued with intensify

916
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,820
so they've been given notice that we are

917
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,850
going to find you and the bigger we've

918
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,040
bits is this and this but then there's

919
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:32,750
this entire process of Grambling and

920
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,180
appeals and lawyers and criminal lawyers

921
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:38,540
and all the rest of it which will get to

922
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:41,120
a point where an amount of money gets

923
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,590
paid well I don't know if anybody knows

924
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,200
this but the ICO don't collect that

925
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,390
money they issue a monetary penalty

926
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,620
notice you daddy daddy darlin when he

927
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,150
gets paid by them the offending

928
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,339
organization but it goes to the center

929
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,800
of Treasury okay so the government gets

930
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,950
that money into a big public account

931
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:02,990
that they let spend on reason shit

932
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:04,759
probably it would be idealistic to think

933
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:07,089
it gets spent on something good but

934
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,270
unlikely the realistic world that we

935
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:12,590
suppose our horses nose got that's just

936
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:14,060
so we talked about zero days been all

937
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,770
cool and stuff and people are talking

938
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,870
about in the news will of zero days but

939
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,940
actually if you really do a little bit

940
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,200
of like analysis of a zero day well it's

941
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,300
the risk of that to you as an

942
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,730
organization or an individual in a lot

943
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:29,240
of cases it's none one's ear on day zero

944
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,980
a day one dates and a 30 day ninety it's

945
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,839
probably still zero risk to the vast

946
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:37,820
majority of people as a company security

947
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,390
offender work in a company look like the

948
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:43,850
company I work for okay maybe a little

949
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,640
about zero days I care about the 60

950
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:49,670
windows server 2003 boxes that have been

951
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,549
there that nobody care about for the

952
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:55,310
past 15 years or care about those thirty

953
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,810
Debian's that there was a buncha for you

954
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,759
know for that kicking around over there

955
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:01,040
now I can't quite get anybody to give

956
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,220
enough of a shit about to fix there are

957
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,630
the things that keep me up at night not

958
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,370
blue key and not other things not

959
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,230
probably not specks you're not meltdown

960
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,930
probably not a good example but

961
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,720
certainly spectrum out there by AMD

962
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,490
third row is what it is okay

963
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,830
I think technological debt is their

964
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,140
biggest problem with cybersecurity we're

965
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,910
asked to drag all of these boxes and all

966
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,190
this ancient crap and then we're asked

967
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,109
to try and secure it when the most

968
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,000
effective thing we could probably do is

969
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,450
just upgrade a lot of it to a platform

970
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,849
that is supported

971
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,680
you know and this is this is the problem

972
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:38,010
and I'm gonna go back to government

973
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,899
especially the NHS we're putting the NHS

974
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,750
trust in an impossible position we're

975
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,260
asking them to decide between staff for

976
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:48,240
health care like nurses and doctors or

977
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,609
spend it on IT well which do you think

978
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,049
is gonna win oh right which do you think

979
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:54,720
is going to look best in front of the

980
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:57,180
public this is why we have like three IT

981
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,220
guys looking after ten thousand devices

982
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,770
in some hospital and then just by

983
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:04,049
accident twenty percent of the NHS as

984
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:07,290
capacity gets wiped out by an accidental

985
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:09,750
site cyber attack since chills up my

986
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:13,259
spine if there was a deliberate cyber

987
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:16,890
attack on the National Health System in

988
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:21,630
the UK yeah so yeah and the other thing

989
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:24,299
was I've seen ISM from a systems point

990
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:27,329
of view developing systems Leslie from

991
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:30,960
the ground up security czar from Wharton

992
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:35,280
at the last phase the last bit and a

993
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,819
good example is all the online like AWS

994
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:43,020
see if three buckets

995
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:44,759
MongoDB ezel a sec search voice to my

996
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,890
knowledge now are probably one of the

997
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,410
biggest threats from a data breach point

998
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,770
of view you constantly see time and time

999
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,520
again

1000
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:56,849
hey this data got needs because north

1001
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,829
educational organization so getting

1002
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:04,380
security folk involved at the right time

1003
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:07,079
I think is really important yeah that's

1004
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:11,130
perfect time um but I put this picture

1005
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:13,380
up here because it's all right and that

1006
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,420
wall there is particularly important

1007
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,270
role does not what particularly say you

1008
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,900
and walk under it and that's your

1009
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,130
internship that's the Windows XP war

1010
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,220
that's the fuck that's the firewall is

1011
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,780
here so just state really quickly so

1012
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,180
re-emphasize the point

1013
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,890
nothing nothing you see that was to do

1014
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,440
with the zero days mask didn't yet pot

1015
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:37,529
because the zero days that Canucks were

1016
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,030
saying was out of date things wanna try

1017
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,700
those out of date things

1018
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:44,069
Windows XP SMB be won't report for core

1019
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,598
by the internet so in technical

1020
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:47,699
dog you don't wanna cry once is evil

1021
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,489
days because at Anna Lou was a little

1022
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:52,289
thing but watch was dispatcher it been

1023
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:54,509
made available treatments private sure

1024
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:56,369
so this would have done some work to

1025
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:57,869
mitigate and this is actually the one

1026
00:45:56,369 --> 00:45:59,910
thing that I'm going to say is is

1027
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:02,910
filling my heart with joy is because

1028
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,649
when blue keep came out us-cert and CSC

1029
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,449
they were all over it they were warning

1030
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,759
people Microsoft was warning it this

1031
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:11,400
could be weaponized this could kill you

1032
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:14,219
please handle carefully yeah they didn't

1033
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,170
do that for this is for the Shadow

1034
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:17,249
Broker stuff baseball I think it's

1035
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,209
because it's not government bleep

1036
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:19,948
they're like well we already knew about

1037
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:23,609
this shit for the past five years ago

1038
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:27,029
fuck but you you said it perfectly and

1039
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:29,130
you know the NHS wasn't a deliberate

1040
00:46:27,029 --> 00:46:31,109
victim of the wanna cry attack it was

1041
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:34,739
collateral damage in a wider attack

1042
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:37,078
aimed ultimately but it could have been

1043
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:40,349
prevented and I also want to point out

1044
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:43,249
aircraft Baxter so anyone aware of how

1045
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:47,219
much their breach across the company

1046
00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:50,669
raise your hands if you know one point

1047
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:53,309
four billion dollars and as I said I'm a

1048
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,319
cock earlier this morning there the

1049
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:57,660
potential fix for that was possibly a

1050
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:59,369
one-line change so one-line change

1051
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,109
potentially you could have cost the

1052
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:04,170
company one point four million dollars

1053
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:06,630
yes I didn't ask attack they lost four

1054
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:08,849
hundred million dollars in a week yeah
