1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,440
kicked out so I'm sorry to talk here

2
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:10,450
last year on track to is people eight

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,830
it's gonna be people you again I'm a

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,200
senior lecturer here at the University

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,420
in cybersecurity how do you see whether

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,359
up deal with it I'm not the College of

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,010
Mercer it's what people know us before

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,800
being a lecturer though I've worked for

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:27,310
a lot of different companies I tricked

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,830
them into sponsoring here before quit so

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,970
I'm quite happy with how that turned out

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,430
because I like Jack I'm to start with

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,969
some stats and a little quiz very simple

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:41,620
like who can tell me what is 7.5 billion

15
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:44,290
either all staff in 2018 woman yes well

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,718
population easy want there's not many

17
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,760
numbers at some point I did it and this

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,949
is from the US Census this was June July

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:57,099
last year five point zero nine billion

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,680
Oh spawn a nice best guess because

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,430
nobody knows some people say it's a

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,019
little bit lower

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,730
some people say it's a bit higher they

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:10,990
spell somewhere in the middle and the

25
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:17,950
last one six million not brag because

26
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:19,380
you know no one how many people work in

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,659
cybersecurity worldwide

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,880
not a lot so if this is the whole white

29
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:28,210
board the whole white board is 7.5

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,479
billion or two about here

31
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,669
it's how many breach records are and you

32
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,110
are this little sticker down in the

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,240
court

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,560
there's not many of us sounds like a lot

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,460
put us all together it'd be quite a lot

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,020
but there's not a lot better really and

37
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,158
that gives us this problem a lot of

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,740
people everyone's got different

39
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,689
experiences different backgrounds

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,789
everyone he's in tech now there's more

41
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,369
phones and tech devices and there are

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,020
people on the planet yeah loads

43
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,729
of breaches and they're not getting any

44
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,619
better

45
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,289
there's always something new and there's

46
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,680
not many of us roughly not quite not 8

47
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,890
percent of the world population so

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,090
that's why it's a little jump scale it

49
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,190
stats are really bad on the numbers

50
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,050
working in security but you can find

51
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,670
them as really easy off the gap inside

52
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,170
the security seals at 2020

53
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,910
they just make up numbers all time it's

54
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,929
been as low as a million as high as five

55
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,230
in real I see so there's not many of us

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,959
so make at least Palatine centage and

57
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,640
sometimes we aren't nice people so

58
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,549
someone saw the picture of Scott home in

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,279
the urinal use that information actually

60
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:49,450
one he's been mentioned several times

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:52,720
that we might appear as a selfie yes it

62
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,328
will appear eventually and we get people

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,790
doing things like this so well in it is

64
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,560
the CTO for Amazon I think of yesterday

65
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,260
there's always that idiot that will

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,019
click the link and the pure everyone

67
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,810
here is said that about someone or

68
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:10,180
thought probably not done it in front of

69
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,760
millions of people watching their videos

70
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,269
and the head of one of the largest

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,959
companies groundbreaking research for

72
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:22,480
you calling people idiots doesn't work

73
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,959
it just pisses them up and they ignore

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,760
you

75
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,230
that's the problem we have insecurities

76
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,000
we've had it for years we call people

77
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:32,768
idiots do a take all the

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,349
computers off them I think I've said

79
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,989
that's my mum before still wish dear

80
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:40,630
select export' calls and that's why I

81
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,730
got you to all stand up you're all glued

82
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,250
up people you all got at least an

83
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,369
interest in security or you work in

84
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,530
security and I'm hearing from I'm

85
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,419
authoritative because I'm stood up and I

86
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,669
have a lanyard I've got a camera on me

87
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:55,900
and you just did what I said people

88
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:00,190
gonna listen to were don't think they're

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,079
idiots people aren't idiots some can act

90
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,940
like idiots but there's a bad way

91
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,900
wording it with the world's best

92
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,530
photoshopping skills

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,849
I'm hoping this is what he meant there's

94
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,060
always a person that will make in the

95
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:15,010
safety and we all make sense

96
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,720
that's what clicking a link this they're

97
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,858
designed for you to click on it and

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,070
catch it I've got Carl Gottlieb admitted

99
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,320
to nearly clicking on one in his first

100
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:30,330
top and he is deeply opened does all

101
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,330
this stuff and those it real well

102
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:38,950
he is an idiot that's because he's dpo

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,750
anyone likes gdpr I guess he likes

104
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,530
paycheck from jeans yeah I'd quite like

105
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,270
that but yeah that's the one who is a

106
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,320
senior management figure I think that's

107
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,609
how probably described himself probably

108
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,719
screw himself up a little bit more

109
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,640
grandiose than that

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,440
but that thing people will make mistakes

111
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,219
and I job to help them make fewer

112
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,900
mistakes that's all we're doing through

113
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,090
implementation of Technology through

114
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,640
training through hopefully not the

115
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,729
crappy training of Hammond through the

116
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,700
slides and get to the end but no one

117
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:18,100
looks at but that's our job we hate how

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:21,159
people are make us X one of my problems

119
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,200
with my job is if I up I've got 340

120
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,580
people every couple of years that make

121
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,469
amends X now I'm confident I know I'm

122
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,270
doing because the people will keep

123
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:36,730
sending place and shoes to keep taking

124
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:38,880
up so pretty confident I won't do it but

125
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,290
people will make mistakes

126
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,219
second thing that might check yourself

127
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,350
before you wreck yourself

128
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,170
and the Restless learners act like a

129
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,490
dick to everyone people if that's their

130
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,960
only interaction with someone in

131
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,080
technology they're gonna assume we're

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,440
old X then he won't come across the back

133
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,210
before don't be a dick she's pretty

134
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,250
straightforward I think that should be a

135
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,940
hedge our policy just one luck you know

136
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,990
Paul enters be back done

137
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,640
that's what it comes down to if you guys

138
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,540
just ask yourself that some people are

139
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,610
just dicks about realize that dicks if

140
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,930
anyone's wondering yes my lectures are

141
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:20,080
the swearing that is not changed but

142
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,800
peopIe mind what you say towards people

143
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:29,130
little impact that you have have you on

144
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,740
industry and the last one stay humble

145
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,300
you all you nothing at some point I

146
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,160
don't know anyone that was born being a

147
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,820
Sheree rock star God that everything

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
something we'll definitely think they

149
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,230
have some people forget easy to forget

150
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,820
but we only nothing at some party

151
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:51,160
I like to in the past at least digger

152
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,070
developers I worked in a few out so I

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,450
obviously hate developers because

154
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,900
they're all idiots and all making

155
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,550
aesthetics but a lot of them may get

156
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,489
forced to ship code that they have

157
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,450
probably don't want to ship either

158
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,360
they're getting downward pressure

159
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,409
because we need to make the money

160
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,320
because we've just been bought out and

161
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,360
spent loads of money I've been on that

162
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,990
side as well haha oh we've just spent

163
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,040
millions

164
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,540
oh need to make that gap so these

165
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,270
people would probably do want to help

166
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,730
you but just getting pressured

167
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,760
themselves so the moat knowing about

168
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:30,610
security some well bit of a mix we've

169
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,010
got some in here and then developers and

170
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,410
who've done some scary stuff but this

171
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,880
for me is why it's all about remember

172
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,660
this and you won't go wrong in that

173
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,030
security pepper just think they probably

174
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,940
not be told that they need to sanitize

175
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,099
their inputs it's easy if you've been on

176
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,160
a wild thing everyone knows that but at

177
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,740
some point people don't know that I'm

178
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,940
ending with bad systems and then you get

179
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,870
a new pair you don't coffee personnel

180
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,170
you know it's bad they're gone because

181
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,280
we've always done it that way I'm doing

182
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,660
it that way for 20 years

183
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,210
there's definitely some people like that

184
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:10,120
here today that's why I no longer work

185
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:12,370
for them but keep this in mind that's

186
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,470
all I wanted to say goodbye the on

187
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,830
Twitter it's just my name it's very easy

188
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,860
if you want students for places or

189
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,570
graduates I have business cards because

190
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm apparently a lot of have business

191
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:31,480
cards crap I don't know why I have any

192
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,419
questions just feeds me in the bath

193
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,700
that's the best thing man men freeze a

194
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,699
time for each one of you
