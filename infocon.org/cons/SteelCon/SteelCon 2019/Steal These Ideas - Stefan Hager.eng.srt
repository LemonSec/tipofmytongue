1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:09,180
thank you very much for having this very

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:13,110
difficult time slot between lunch and

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:17,400
the next talk because I know everybody

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,490
is still basically trying to process the

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,479
food this talk is about steal these

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,669
ideas and basically I thought about all

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,590
the stuff that have happened in the

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,170
industry since a long time and what I

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:39,210
think we as blue team's we as defenders

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,390
might still do wrong this this famous

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,800
quote by a guy called Madonna's regime

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,780
sometimes people think the mistakes they

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,140
keep making since that he is our

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,370
experience now what you need to know

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,460
about Mulla Nasruddin

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,599
is that this guy sits backwards on his

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,880
ass and we might disagree on a few

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,190
things I'm going to talk about that's

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,060
perfectly fine and where I'm coming from

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,999
is some of that position because all the

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,179
mistakes I'm pointing out something we

22
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:15,149
our company still does in some respects

23
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:17,909
other companies do I just would like to

24
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:20,459
change it for the better and I also

25
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,399
think that a lot of the stuff probably

26
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,729
isn't going to be that new but I'd like

27
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:28,499
to present you with a few ways out maybe

28
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:30,329
and how we can actually tackle a few of

29
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:36,029
the things that I think we're doing

30
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:39,419
wrong another short disclaimer I'm going

31
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:43,469
to use a few stories to illustrate my

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,139
points and all of these stories are true

33
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:48,119
I will have altered the names of the

34
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:51,119
companies or the people or whatever or

35
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,099
not actually name them at all but they

36
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,289
are mostly true I didn't actually make

37
00:01:53,099 --> 00:02:01,229
them up and just a small request because

38
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:03,029
I oh I have a watch here I want to say I

39
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,029
don't have a watch I don't know when I'm

40
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:08,310
finished but I started wearing what

41
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:10,579
sorry I'm cut that out from from the

42
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,580
video

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,530
whenever we are talking about things

44
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,130
that could be done better we can

45
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,140
identify patterns patterns within

46
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,390
different things the organization humans

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,440
or technical patterns I use technical

48
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,140
patterns as the first thing because many

49
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,050
of the main points are of a technical

50
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,410
nature if you think about where security

51
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,450
is coming from or has come from the 90s

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,060
where I started working in in the

53
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:47,690
industry to now it was a very different

54
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,270
kind of Beast back then so the first

55
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,680
thing and I'm going to talk in length

56
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,810
about that is logging basically so who

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,730
of you if you'd like to doing the favor

58
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,890
and do a show of hands who of you is

59
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,570
logging nearly everything on a technical

60
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,130
level that happens in the network and

61
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:10,670
their enterprise and their appliances

62
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:13,070
and everything we Q so next question

63
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:18,079
would be who of you is looking at all of

64
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:21,799
these logs and that I think is one of

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,390
the problems because from a technical

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,940
point of view from a forensic point of

67
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,820
view it's great if you have access to

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,070
all the locks it's wonderful if you need

69
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,390
to find out what went wrong then you

70
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,030
need to have a look at the rocks you

71
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,040
should have all of them but from a

72
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,080
defendant's point of view I don't want

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,030
to look at the locks when I'm doing a

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,010
forensic investigation of the case I

75
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:48,320
want to have an alert when some script

76
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,880
finds out that my locks look suspicious

77
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,040
and I need to have a look at it now

78
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,120
before it becomes an incident that I

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,109
need to forensically investigate so I

80
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:04,070
would like to make a strong case on

81
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:06,410
selective alerting on locks this is

82
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,230
something that can get us out of a lot

83
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,940
of problems probably all of you who are

84
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,480
working for a larger company will have

85
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,600
some kind of cm PDQ radar beat slung or

86
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,200
any other window I don't want to single

87
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,930
anyone out and all of them give you the

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,530
opportunity to combine different kinds

89
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,540
of events

90
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,590
to say if this happens and that happens

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:34,220
then this is quite actually bad now what

92
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,219
happens if you have security use cases

93
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,350
that are not really very good then your

94
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,430
analysts again get flooded with alerts

95
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:47,960
and very much of them will be crap so

96
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:52,669
you need to avoid false positives as

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,859
much as you can if you do a daily tuning

98
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,080
of your locks of your alerts and

99
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,110
everything I think that can be done and

100
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,710
you can get valuable statistics and

101
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,930
that's a very very good point as well if

102
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,349
you have a few people who are looking at

103
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,480
the loss

104
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,450
tuning them and bringing them into

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,919
alerts then you will have this team will

106
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,229
have a very good feeling of what's

107
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,430
happening in your network and what is

108
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,080
considered to be normal because if you

109
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,110
speak to any vendor somewhere they say

110
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,800
well we do Network anomaly detection and

111
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:30,440
things like that but in order to find

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,040
out what's not normal you need to have

113
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,630
some kind of identifier what actually is

114
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,380
normal and if you don't look at your

115
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:43,120
logs on a regular basis I think this is

116
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,120
going this is going to be really hot

117
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:51,380
we've got a shitload of locks everywhere

118
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,050
this is just a small subset and I

119
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,979
intended to do something like 99 use

120
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:00,740
cases in under 10 minutes to baffle you

121
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,860
and to show off my mind ignorant but

122
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,570
basically I didn't do that but if you

123
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,520
think about use case and security use

124
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,110
cases I'm not talking about monitoring I

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,729
want to make that point clear because

126
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,070
monitoring is important you need to do

127
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:17,090
that with monitoring I mean you need to

128
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,159
watch for a service CPU memory whether

129
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,349
the heart is full and so on and so forth

130
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,440
but that has nothing to do with security

131
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:27,590
lock security logging for example if you

132
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,770
think about your web service you provide

133
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,429
some kind of website to your clients

134
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,620
coming from the internet that's fine but

135
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,160
for example you could alert whenever one

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,860
of those web servers that are

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,620
to the Internet starts initiating a

138
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,560
connection because that is irregular or

139
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,410
if you have some kind of substandard

140
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,300
ports and there's a connection going to

141
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,750
them and it's allowed you might want to

142
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,640
know about that so when you when I'm

143
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,160
thinking about security use cases this

144
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,610
is always the case that actually you try

145
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,320
to find out stuff that should not happen

146
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,810
where you are sure you did everything to

147
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,610
prevent it but basically checking on

148
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,520
that and getting an alert is something

149
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:16,590
that is worth looking at another example

150
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,479
would be mail servers you probably have

151
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,000
a few mail service that are allowed to

152
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,670
send mail out to the internet if you

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,400
don't I got you to restrict the group of

154
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:29,880
Mason's that can send mail in your

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,950
firewalls and just check if really just

156
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,710
that group is sending mail because if

157
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,960
another server starts sending mail check

158
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,710
for spam check whether anything happened

159
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,340
with that and by combining different

160
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,370
locks you am constructing interesting

161
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:52,409
use cases you actually can get a lot of

162
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:54,690
insight in what's happening and you can

163
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,300
put alarms and other words together that

164
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:03,900
will help you to do to defend yourself a

165
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:06,060
lot better so another good thing which

166
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,919
is embarrassing is that usually you get

167
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,750
the speaker's view on there and now my

168
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,490
notes because I need notes because I

169
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,180
only have pictures but I know what I'm

170
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,030
talking about

171
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,740
hopefully in this case in this story

172
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:22,739
time there was a company that wanted to

173
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,460
buy a new web application firewall they

174
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,990
were running on Mott security at that

175
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,309
point and they wanted to invest into

176
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,740
something that was not community based

177
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,390
and that was from bigger vendor because

178
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,229
of reasons because they thought that

179
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:43,229
would be better to handle and easier to

180
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,300
manage and so on and so forth so they

181
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:48,050
went to the manager in question who

182
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,939
would sign off the six-figure bill and

183
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,199
they made their case and the manager

184
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,480
said well

185
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,070
how does how does it work now they said

186
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,770
well we have this weapon vacation

187
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,690
firewall and whenever something

188
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,870
suspicious is going on then

189
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,730
we log it man she said we don't stop the

190
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,590
traffic we just lock it I said yeah

191
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,540
what's management decision because if

192
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,190
you stop the traffic that might be false

193
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,069
positives and clients might not get

194
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:17,220
connection so we just log it Wendy she

195
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,820
said okay understood who's looking at

196
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,400
the logs and the guy said well no one

197
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,070
unless it's an incident we said you want

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,569
to give me you want me to give you

199
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,080
300,000 euros for something you don't

200
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,790
know at the moment either I haven't

201
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,500
understood or you're doing it wrong but

202
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,709
I can't give you the money if you're not

203
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,050
using it so basically that manager got

204
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:44,760
logging understood logging away better

205
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:46,349
then the signal that team did and this

206
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,480
is important because if you can talk to

207
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,750
management and if you can make the case

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,560
to them you will get some more money

209
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,270
hope hopefully so as you can see that

210
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,880
guy at the back of the truck is helping

211
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:04,819
he really is and that's a little bit the

212
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,670
picture I'd like to use to illustrate

213
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,230
how I see logging if you in a security

214
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,469
way if you don't use it to produce

215
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,810
meaningful alerts you've got everything

216
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,390
in place and most of you probably will

217
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,979
pay a lot of money to companies like

218
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,580
Splunk if you're not using having the

219
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:30,630
open source alternative so start using

220
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:33,900
it please the next thing is devices in

221
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,420
your network security appliances about a

222
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,550
month ago I've been to info security at

223
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,979
London and I guess a few of you who have

224
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,349
been as well and you always get the

225
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,340
feeling when walking the floor that you

226
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:50,700
could buy this appliance this wonderful

227
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:53,370
ipv6 6a I enabled that blockchain crypto

228
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,820
box and you just snuck it into your

229
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:59,790
network put in power put in network and

230
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:04,889
it will save your network magically

231
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:09,059
somehow um a lot of those vendors see

232
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:11,549
you think that if they just say trust me

233
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:14,488
long enough that you're going to trust

234
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:18,299
them it doesn't really work with me but

235
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:20,549
on the other hand people are buying them

236
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:23,069
and our company is buying them as well

237
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:25,379
and what it is or what it should be it

238
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:27,029
should be a tool within your whole tool

239
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,129
chain of securing your enterprises

240
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,889
network it should be something that

241
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:34,919
helps you it should be something that is

242
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:38,040
at its place doing what you think is

243
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,019
doing and it should look like a workshop

244
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,649
like that filled with tools but

245
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:46,759
basically I guess if you have an honest

246
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:49,139
hard look at your security appliances

247
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,720
then sometimes it looks like that and

248
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,359
why is that sometimes security

249
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,230
appliances get bought to take a box for

250
00:11:54,359 --> 00:12:00,179
compliancy this is bad because very

251
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,850
often those security appliances have

252
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,749
some kind of function not all are

253
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,679
completely useless

254
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:09,799
I should phrase that more positively a

255
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,259
lot of them are going to provide

256
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:15,299
something not all of the stuff that they

257
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,149
are promised you but they would deliver

258
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,889
in the end but they are providing some

259
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,199
kind of service if you just leave it

260
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:25,169
unattended unpatched in your network and

261
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:30,540
don't look at the locks then you won't

262
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:33,269
have any fun with them and so the next

263
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,248
story time is again from personal

264
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,799
experience with a vendor I won't

265
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:40,290
disclose we did a proof-of-concept with

266
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,600
their box and this was one of the boxes

267
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,179
where everybody said it doesn't need

268
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,819
anything it needs this kind of traffic

269
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,829
mirror and it doesn't need internet

270
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:52,378
connection at all we won't speak out to

271
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:54,388
the internet it would be good if it had

272
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,069
some kind of internet access for updates

273
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:00,809
and it needs power and so on so forth

274
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:04,049
so because the technician was a guy I

275
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:06,179
knew and trusted we tried the thing I'm

276
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:10,739
usually not really falling for its

277
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:13,499
metric trust me but and they said well

278
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:16,579
it's going to you plug it in and boom

279
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:18,660
metrics happens so would you like to

280
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,878
take a guess what kind

281
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,209
magic was happening when we plugged it

282
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,160
in well first thing is of course it

283
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:29,670
connected to home base to get updates

284
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,709
but that was kind of expected the next

285
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,589
thing was that we didn't really get a

286
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:37,290
lot of others from that box we monitored

287
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:39,899
it and we had a few things mostly false

288
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,060
positives it was something to detect

289
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:45,930
anomalies in our network and alert us if

290
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,388
something was going wrong and basically

291
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,069
I'm a suspicious guy if the new box

292
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,750
doesn't tell me anything is wrong within

293
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:54,389
our network I get suspicious

294
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:59,160
it's I know our network is good and

295
00:13:54,389 --> 00:14:01,800
everything but basically I never trust

296
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:06,420
anyone who tells me that everything is

297
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,639
peachy and vanilla so we had a look

298
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,779
ourselves I tried to create a few alarms

299
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,149
didn't work and I then had a phone call

300
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,329
with a technician and during the phone

301
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:20,959
call I found out that he read a few

302
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,160
things to me well think you're worth or

303
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,839
where did you get that information and

304
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,920
he said well our dashboard looks

305
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,490
different is it just wait a minute you

306
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,469
have a dashboard I have a dashboard and

307
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:37,620
is the customer paying for that box see

308
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,910
less than you I said yeah that's the

309
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,790
moment at the moment that's the way

310
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,469
worse and I just plucked it off I

311
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,910
blacked it out and send it back to him

312
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,920
because we didn't buy it yet and it was

313
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,660
a proof of concept but this is the kind

314
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,500
of you you have to deal with and

315
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,360
you have to look for that and afterwards

316
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,220
they also told us that yeah it didn't

317
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,319
produce meaningful results because we

318
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,259
didn't plug it in into our active

319
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:04,050
directory and we didn't provide this in

320
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,149
that beta but the sales team denied

321
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,189
before him that the Box would use the

322
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:11,100
data so be very very suspicious about

323
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:12,809
that please and if you have boxes like

324
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,930
that in your network I'd like to think

325
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:19,889
about powering them off if you don't use

326
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,479
them they are basically from a technical

327
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:24,899
point of view a security risk

328
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,420
because you've got another gate into

329
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,490
your network it might be the vendor the

330
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,610
vendor might be in a moment

331
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,829
they might not be whoever knows

332
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,709
and if it's just to take a box on a list

333
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:40,019
then I urge you to try to get into a

334
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:45,268
discussion with the guys who need that

335
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:47,249
checkbox ticket I know that this is that

336
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,350
is a lot to ask but I think we as

337
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:51,239
defenders also need to get better in

338
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,220
communicating with all the people we are

339
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:55,049
defending very often they don't

340
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,329
understand what we are doing and we

341
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:01,350
don't actually try to understand what

342
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,729
they are doing or what they need us if

343
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,399
you don't want to power it off if you

344
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,040
can't power it off start using it start

345
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,079
making use of the NOx again go into

346
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,189
logging try to produce meaningful alerts

347
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,829
for what it's worth

348
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:16,049
because basically for me at the end if

349
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:18,689
it does if you need to run it and you

350
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:21,600
can't power it off and it provides 15%

351
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:24,809
security instead of 100% security it's

352
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,350
still 50% more than zero but if you can

353
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:30,600
power it off just do it

354
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:35,279
and another thing that comes from the

355
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:38,480
whole mindset that we developed wheezes

356
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,209
Edmunds I'm talking about us old farts

357
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,049
20 30 years ago we thought that security

358
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:48,268
men network security which is you know

359
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:50,399
you secure your network you've got a

360
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:55,319
firewall you know where your parameters

361
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:58,499
you just build walls around that which

362
00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:00,689
works fine for castles usually but if

363
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:03,179
you think and it worked in 2000 maybe

364
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:06,209
but if you think of nowadays workplaces

365
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:09,418
you will have stuff like site to site

366
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,579
VPN people working from home people

367
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:15,630
bringing their mobile devices into your

368
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,549
network and so on and so forth so again

369
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:21,240
I'd like to ask you a question who of

370
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,859
you feels confident in defining all the

371
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,370
entry points into their companies

372
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,269
networks

373
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:32,668
I don't I know we've got way over 10 15

374
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:34,919
or 20 words a large network but still it

375
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:36,809
really gets hard to defend on just that

376
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,970
level and even if you're really

377
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:41,250
confident that you know everything about

378
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,270
your network and your parameter then

379
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,270
there are guys like tinker

380
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,109
[Music]

381
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,460
it's one of my favorite treats because

382
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,139
it's like yeah I've got a domain

383
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:59,850
controller what what I'm a my going to

384
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:01,559
do with it but I think very often the

385
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,620
physical level of things is not being

386
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,780
taken into account I once worked for a

387
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,739
company and they had their data centers

388
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,090
distributed as you do because you know

389
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,330
always thinking about the worst case if

390
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:18,480
one goes down then you need to use the

391
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,299
other one and the second data center was

392
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,210
in the cellar of a building that did

393
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,740
leatherworking and was really loud and

394
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,110
it was really hidden and nobody went

395
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,850
there except people like me who needed

396
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,789
to work on service there or fire was

397
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,010
there and one day I went there and the

398
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:37,350
door was open and there was a stone just

399
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:41,400
holding the door open this was an

400
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,678
alerted door and with just a few keys so

401
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,919
it was really furious and I went inside

402
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,860
and there was nobody injured so I

403
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,350
started to dialogue the number of my

404
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,020
boss to tell him that this is highly

405
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,990
irregular and a few people came back

406
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,720
obviously from lunch into the room and

407
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:03,140
they were working on cable server

408
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,940
electricians who were paid to do work

409
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:10,350
but nobody gave them the key and the

410
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:14,039
person who should be there supervising

411
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:17,399
them he buggered off for lunch - but not

412
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:20,158
with them so their only option in order

413
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,890
to keep working was to put a stone in

414
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,600
the door and hold it open and this is

415
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,059
something you know all the backups of

416
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,740
all the data we had this is 20 years ago

417
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,090
was in that second second datacenter any

418
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,409
attacker with malicious intent would

419
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:39,149
have a field day

420
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:43,500
they found it out yeah basically I

421
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:46,169
already had the story time and the thing

422
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,059
is to me that security

423
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:50,220
you must include people not just people

424
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:53,190
other things as well but especially

425
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:56,490
people if you consider this this looks

426
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,770
like a perfect barrier right and every

427
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,810
human who approaches that

428
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:18,990
see it's a barrier do you agree so

429
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:20,909
consider this people will be people

430
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,240
people will be like that and no matter

431
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:31,410
how much we want them to to respect that

432
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:35,040
barrier they won't and another thing is

433
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,200
the whole dogma of never touch a running

434
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,180
system if you talk to all the security

435
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,210
guys or all the SIS admins and people in

436
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,800
tech they might tell you that never

437
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,040
touch a running system was kind of a

438
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,230
mantra again 20 10 years ago but it's

439
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,450
not really valid for nowadays but still

440
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,520
people are stuck in that mindset that if

441
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,800
you have a machine and it does its job

442
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,530
and it does its job well then you

443
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,600
shouldn't touch it you shouldn't touch

444
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,570
it at all because if you touch it and it

445
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,959
breaks you have to repair it which sucks

446
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:12,919
so never touch a running system became

447
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:15,300
one of the strongest things that people

448
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,430
the strongest points people try to make

449
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,649
when you were working on hardware or

450
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,330
software you don't just patch things

451
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,140
because you might break it if it runs

452
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:27,810
let it run and nowadays it's more or

453
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,640
less constantly update everything I mean

454
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,399
there's fridges connected to the

455
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,700
Internet there's smart diapers that tell

456
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,940
the parents if the baby may hurt

457
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,650
whatever in the diaper and sex toys are

458
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,630
connected to the Internet everything is

459
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,460
connected to the Internet and as soon as

460
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,030
it's connected to the Internet it tries

461
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,350
to update if there are days I mean this

462
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,720
IRT is a whole different kind of beast

463
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,850
and there's enough stuff that doesn't

464
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,470
get updated at all but if there are

465
00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:00,750
updates stuff is constantly updating now

466
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,400
if you consider those to never touch a

467
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,820
running system and constantly update

468
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,940
everything you can't have both you just

469
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:13,570
can't have both and the problem is that

470
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,420
especially with medical devices it's not

471
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:19,120
easy to update it's not easy to patch at

472
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,490
all but medical devices is for me one of

473
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,979
the most interesting use cases because

474
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,130
you've got machines that are certified

475
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,040
to operate on humans and they are

476
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,990
certified for a very very specific

477
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:35,290
hardware revision and software level and

478
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,240
as soon as you change the tiniest bit

479
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,450
it's not certified to operate on humans

480
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,310
anymore and guess what if the doctor we

481
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,290
have a whoever's operating them makes a

482
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:47,830
mistake then the influence won't cover

483
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,510
it so these things don't get updated as

484
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,030
we have seen with one or crying other

485
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:57,040
things this is going to be a massive

486
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:58,810
problem but you can't update them not in

487
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,170
the way that you can update your your

488
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,830
mobile phone or apps or anything so what

489
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,810
can you do

490
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,610
again one shouldn't just stand there and

491
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,470
think I can't do anything anyway so I

492
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:17,889
just let let you run its course oh yeah

493
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,750
sorry about that thing that everything

494
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,300
is connected to the Internet I found the

495
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:26,200
tree I have no idea whether this is just

496
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:30,030
a joke or made up or not but there is a

497
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,880
samsung lcd fridge with twitter and apps

498
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:35,800
so it's probably a choke but it's a good

499
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,210
one everything is connected to the

500
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:43,780
Internet and even if you don't know it

501
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:46,720
yeah and that's upset sometimes all of

502
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,420
you will know that in our industry

503
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,940
there's no silver bullet for this stuff

504
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,770
we're facing so even if I say you know

505
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,870
you need to constantly update everything

506
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,810
or patch everything there might be

507
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,669
solutions but they could be ugly no

508
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:06,100
picture though it's just one of the

509
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:10,810
pictures that came up when I google the

510
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:13,149
solutions that we have is the one thing

511
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,330
is you should update everything that you

512
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,330
can

513
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,780
the other thing is if you can't update

514
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,090
it then try things like virtual patching

515
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,340
this is meaning if you have a web

516
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,559
application firewall and will never look

517
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,990
medical device let's say behind that and

518
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,879
you know it's this there's a

519
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,010
vulnerability and you want to protect

520
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,140
against that protect against it on the

521
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:38,840
web application firewall level this is

522
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,520
ugly and I that's why I called an ugly

523
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,220
solutions so please don't heckle me and

524
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,379
say exactly because I know on the other

525
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,990
hand if that is the only way to protect

526
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,240
the machine then it's better than

527
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,770
nothing it will fail if the Web

528
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,049
Application Firewall goes down because

529
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,629
usually then traffic just passes through

530
00:24:54,049 --> 00:25:00,770
but on the other hand it will help you

531
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:04,309
that as long as it's running and you

532
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:06,408
could do again networks for that stuff I

533
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:08,539
know that has issues as well because

534
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:11,120
everything has issues but try to find

535
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:13,700
out how you can minimize the risk for

536
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,250
the stuff that is at risk within your

537
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,620
company and of course you could also

538
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,030
start with not clocking everything into

539
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,520
the Internet and making everything

540
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:26,059
online I mean why does a diet that need

541
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,799
to be online I have no idea but well

542
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:33,940
that's a concerned parent you can see

543
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:33,940
the level of which is great again

544
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,980
there are some organizational patterns

545
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,610
as well these were the technical

546
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,919
patterns and within organizations we

547
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,500
have to deal with other people which is

548
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,000
unfortunate but it's part of our job and

549
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,409
it gets more in the future I'm saying

550
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,150
this is unfortunate this is a joke

551
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:55,070
because actually I think we really need

552
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,470
to connect more to the people we are

553
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,340
protecting we need to talk to them more

554
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:04,549
and very often sometimes not very often

555
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:08,178
but sometimes when you have kind of a

556
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:11,179
tech ignorant sea level they are of the

557
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:16,330
opinion that secure should mean it's

558
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:19,700
100% secure this is a major

559
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:22,490
communication thing between techies and

560
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,040
non-techies because basically I don't

561
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,750
know about you but as somebody coming

562
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,790
from a technical background if somebody

563
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:33,830
tells me it needs to be 100 percent

564
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:35,240
secur nothing is absolutely nothing is

565
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,159
everything can fail it might be

566
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,290
ninety-nine point whatever percent but

567
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,710
it's not 100% and I never can guarantee

568
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:44,570
100% for somebody coming from marketing

569
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,940
or somebody not coming from a technical

570
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:50,870
background that is good enough that's

571
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:55,870
kind of what they mean by 100% but we

572
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,870
need to have that kind of discussion and

573
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:03,740
that's one thing our industry has split

574
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,620
opinions to say the least and that is

575
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:11,900
antivirus I've talked to people who said

576
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:16,040
very often younger people not really

577
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:19,600
working yet but very tech-savvy who told

578
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,670
me you know antivirus is so broken and

579
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,770
can be abused and everything so you're

580
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:31,580
better off if you don't run any

581
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:34,400
antivirus system I came up with those

582
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,560
two plates which might be a shitty

583
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,670
comparison but you're going to have to

584
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:43,520
listen to it anyway so consider those

585
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:46,310
two plates the one plane doesn't have

586
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,710
parachutes on it parachutes

587
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:54,200
you know those am I saying it right yeah

588
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:57,710
both planes are probably going to have

589
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,410
problems midair first plane doesn't have

590
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:03,920
any poachers second one has parachutes

591
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:07,130
they only open in about 7080 percent of

592
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,640
all cases and someone has found a fancy

593
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,240
way to make them burst into flames

594
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,560
midair

595
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:19,270
if they are on the same plane which

596
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:22,879
claim are you going to board and I'm

597
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:25,040
playing B because it has freedom punches

598
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,160
because if the plane is going to have

599
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,980
problems and I take the risk that the

600
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,620
guy who figured of me figured out a way

601
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,050
how to set them aflame midair I'll take

602
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:39,020
that risk

603
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,580
I'm really boasting about my own company

604
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,900
it's not my own company the company I

605
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:47,270
work for sorry

606
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:50,170
should be little bit more humble that we

607
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:52,879
have a email system that tries to catch

608
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:56,480
viruses and malware like everybody else

609
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,090
and we got certified this is chairman so

610
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:05,180
it could say I'd like to have a salsa

611
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:06,830
troll if you run it through Google

612
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,590
Translate it says that our corporate

613
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,809
email security is certified by a be test

614
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,209
which you might or might not know German

615
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:18,020
company as well and it catches a lot of

616
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:21,050
stuff so you can use antivirus in a way

617
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:23,540
that is helpful the way we're using it

618
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,879
if you're interested I can talk about we

619
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,870
we have several scanners and we keep

620
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,850
emails for 24 hours and scan them within

621
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,340
those 24 hours we deliver them already

622
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,840
but within 24 hours they get rescan at

623
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,500
risk and whenever there's new patterns

624
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,439
if we find that it had a virus we try to

625
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,840
get it from the post post get it back if

626
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,040
it has already been opened we know which

627
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:52,070
PC probably is connected and so on so

628
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,409
you can use it in a meaningful way if

629
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:56,059
you're just running your own computer at

630
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,770
home or your own server and you know

631
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:02,110
what you're doing you might not need

632
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,110
antivirus totally with you're not ready

633
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,139
I'll try to talk

634
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:18,750
but yes you can if you're just doing for

635
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:21,210
yourself I'm pretty sure you don't need

636
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,809
a while scanner if you know what you're

637
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:26,610
doing but within a corporate environment

638
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:28,950
there's a lot of people who are not as

639
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,658
tech savvy and who need to be protected

640
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:34,409
and I think that's the trouble the blue

641
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:37,559
team as well and this might sound like a

642
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:40,409
very harsh truth and it is whenever

643
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:43,408
there's attacks going on that are not

644
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:46,409
specifically targeted at your company or

645
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:48,330
your network but that just target

646
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:52,470
everybody they can get like think about

647
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:54,720
wanna cry then you don't really have to

648
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,389
outrun the dragon you have to outrun the

649
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,450
slowest Hobbit so as soon as your

650
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,439
security level is more mature than that

651
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,200
of your peers

652
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,139
you're better protected and anything

653
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,669
that you can do to raise that level I'm

654
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:13,199
not saying leave the slow ones behind

655
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,480
because they are going to be eaten

656
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,610
anyway but I think every little bit you

657
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,610
can do for your company really helps

658
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:29,658
what I also find is that very often we

659
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:31,949
are very much focused on protection and

660
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:35,429
we're waiting for stuff to happen and

661
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:38,850
when stuff happens then we try to figure

662
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:41,460
out what to do next and this is for me a

663
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:44,219
little bit like I've been in enough

664
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,860
security incidents in companies that

665
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,049
didn't have any kind of plan on what to

666
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,408
 do when there's a security

667
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:52,168
incident

668
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:54,299
excuse my language and I hate that

669
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:56,130
because if you talk to the sea level and

670
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:58,830
managers beforehand and say we need to

671
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,510
have a plan we need to be able to act in

672
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,580
the moment when something happens we

673
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:05,730
need to know whom to inform we need to

674
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:09,260
know who can decide what even if it's

675
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,260
Saturday 2:00 a.m.

676
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:13,559
most of the companies say well we will

677
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:15,360
deal with it when we get to the point

678
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,470
but we are protected anyway are you

679
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,479
saying we're on the threat no not

680
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,950
immediately not necessarily

681
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,370
but if you've ever been in the situation

682
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:31,169
in a war room where was hitting the

683
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:33,209
fan then very often this was the thing

684
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:35,190
that you wanted to have you wanted to

685
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:38,429
have a plan because this gives security

686
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,380
because if you are nervous or anxious

687
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:43,049
about what you do next and you have

688
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,260
something laid out when you were of a

689
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:49,320
clear mind then this helps immensely so

690
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:52,649
I'd like to ask you to think about what

691
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,529
could happen you don't need to have a

692
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:57,870
look at the most outrageous things like

693
00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:01,200
that's so going to a bomb is going off

694
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:03,658
and this zombie invasion this is useless

695
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,000
this is tabletop exercises that might be

696
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,179
fun but in the end they are useless but

697
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,639
think about stuff like what happens if a

698
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:14,639
part of your network has ransomware

699
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:16,889
encrypted running what you're going to

700
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:19,469
do and who's going to decide what to do

701
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:22,260
or who is going to authorize what you

702
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:25,100
are about to do like taking a web

703
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:29,010
service or offline and things like that

704
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,678
in a broader view probably you should

705
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:34,200
also have a plan about how to talk to

706
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,340
the media how to talk to your GPR

707
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:41,610
officer who to talk to within your

708
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,220
organization everybody should agree on

709
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:46,229
that if you make the plan for yourself

710
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,480
that's nice that's better than nothing

711
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,519
but try to get it approved across the

712
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,929
whole company so if something happens

713
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,929
you can do something about it

714
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,939
yeah the idea I'd like you just fear

715
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:02,340
from that is really please be prepared

716
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,950
for emergencies and have a written plan

717
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,639
and keep it up to date and also know

718
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,919
where it is

719
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:09,750
because there's nothing worse than

720
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,060
knowing in the back of your head that

721
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,129
you did write something down somewhere

722
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,168
but you don't remember the folder or the

723
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:18,799
share where it was or was it in a blog

724
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:21,149
that have just write it as an email and

725
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,099
when an incident happens and you start

726
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:29,429
searching for the plan that's also not

727
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:32,099
very good one thing where I'm really

728
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:34,379
happy about is when I started a few

729
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,190
years ago were talking about people well

730
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,018
I listen to

731
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:39,418
Jessica Parker talking about that people

732
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:41,609
are not the weakest link and she set me

733
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,098
on the course where I thought yeah this

734
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:47,009
is a topic I'd like to talk about

735
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:48,960
because I also feel that very often we

736
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:52,139
in the industry are doing a shitty job

737
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,970
of protecting the people and very often

738
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,700
you're just pointing at them and saying

739
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,609
the other weakest link they're stupid

740
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:01,680
this is something I could talk about I

741
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:04,640
could go on for hours and I'm going to

742
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:10,109
spare you that but I put a few

743
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,629
interesting talks by other people who

744
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,598
know way more than me in the slide and

745
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:21,359
I'm going to publish the slides today or

746
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:25,799
tomorrow and so I'm only going to go

747
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,720
quickly through with that and I was also

748
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:31,049
already talking about protection about

749
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,470
the network about the parameter and if

750
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:38,250
you think about protection again coming

751
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:39,569
from from the years before we really do

752
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,720
a lot of protection your security

753
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:45,480
basically rests on those three columns

754
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,769
of detection protection and reaction but

755
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,599
it's like with a pay ELC somebody does a

756
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:55,740
shitty hotel and then it looks like that

757
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:59,640
and a lot of your security actually just

758
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,140
really rests on protection if I was to

759
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,839
ask you whether you have a firewall who

760
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,808
probably raise your hand I guess I guess

761
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,440
maybe as well and a lot of those things

762
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:12,150
I decide this goes more in the direction

763
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,630
of detection but a lot of the stuff is

764
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:18,150
just to protect the network because when

765
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,849
we think about detection again we can

766
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:24,480
write hundreds and thousands of locks

767
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:26,460
but without filtering them and coming

768
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,710
back to the meaningful alerts nobody is

769
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,289
going to look at them and you burn every

770
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:34,380
security analyst who who tries to scroll

771
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:36,930
for them I tried when I started with a

772
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,789
new company with a company I'm working

773
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:41,129
for at the moment one of the first

774
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:43,470
things I did was try to look at the

775
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,079
firewall locks and see what could be

776
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:48,569
tuned because nothing's showing up in

777
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,280
the firewall locks is good I

778
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,690
don't really care about anything that

779
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,310
comes from the internet and gets dropped

780
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,130
by the firewall locks I'm not looking at

781
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,560
those but our company has I think about

782
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,970
70 clusters firewall clusters and not

783
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,580
all of them are connected to the

784
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,819
Internet so basically whenever something

785
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,710
is in the locks I thought not usually

786
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,230
I should he'll look at it because either

787
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,170
it's misconfigured server as in ninety

788
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,200
ninety-five percent of all cases or

789
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:17,730
something I need to have look at so

790
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,270
would anyone want to take a guess how

791
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:28,200
many locks the firewalls combined locked

792
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:34,830
in a day 20 million I saw that man I

793
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:37,919
thought you know what it I tried to

794
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,870
I tried to well I I went through the

795
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,960
logs I I tried to see the most

796
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:46,799
Chetty things that went on and tried to

797
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,990
get people to tune the service make it

798
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,780
better but it wasn't an uphill battle

799
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,609
because all day long there's new

800
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,370
services coming up and so on and so

801
00:37:53,610 --> 00:38:00,210
forth and so nobody really is looking at

802
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:03,839
that and my reaction I don't mean hack

803
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,310
back I don't really need to say that to

804
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,490
you but I'm saying that for the sake of

805
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:10,560
the video if somebody from our

806
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,549
government or others are watching the

807
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,590
video I don't say things open still hey

808
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,930
hack back is not an option but reacting

809
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:21,800
to something in an automated way could

810
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:24,720
be a thing for example if you think of

811
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,830
somebody connecting their laptop to the

812
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,290
network and you've got maybe network

813
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:34,140
access control then at the left of ask

814
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,850
and they find out it's got some kind of

815
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,589
software on it that you don't know and

816
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,540
you just put it in a network segment

817
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,090
where it can get updated or inspected

818
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:48,750
this is an automatic reaction and we're

819
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:51,390
not doing a lot of that as well and the

820
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:58,890
last thing is of course there are also

821
00:38:51,390 --> 00:39:00,930
patterns of a human nature so I need to

822
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,379
think about how I put that because I

823
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:03,779
don't

824
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,910
did you get too paranoid I still want

825
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:09,599
you to be friendly and love your

826
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:14,359
teammates and have an open heart for

827
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,819
everyone but on the other hand sometimes

828
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:19,200
you've got people within the team who

829
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:22,499
might not have your best interests at

830
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,058
heart I think personally that it will be

831
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:27,089
very very rare that they are

832
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:28,559
intentionally attacking your company but

833
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:33,420
very often they were will be

834
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:37,229
unintentional will be somebody like how

835
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:39,029
do you put it useful idiots is the term

836
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:41,848
that was coined by governments and spy

837
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:43,950
agencies not coined by me but it's just

838
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:48,950
people who will do stuff for you without

839
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:51,419
realizing what they are doing and I

840
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,700
googled because I wanted to have figures

841
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,499
for insider threats I googled the

842
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:00,989
question where do cyber attacks

843
00:39:55,499 --> 00:40:03,689
originated Google said China good news

844
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:06,329
is that attribution problem is solved

845
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,969
you know it's China babe I just put that

846
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:12,900
in because I had a laugh but then I

847
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:16,339
found that which said that breaches in

848
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,930
24 25 % of breaches of data breaches are

849
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:22,828
coming from unintentional insider

850
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:25,499
threats and again years ago the number

851
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:27,630
of attacks that a company faces was much

852
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:30,538
higher it was something like 70% of

853
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:33,450
attacks are coming from within the

854
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:36,749
network but attacks were also data

855
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:40,468
leakage for example people copying stuff

856
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:41,939
leaving folders unencrypted I like that

857
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:45,089
number because it's still high enough

858
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,430
and it doesn't scare the out of the

859
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:52,038
sea level if you show it to them but

860
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:54,989
it's still high enough to make them act

861
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:58,259
and again you should be kind and

862
00:40:54,989 --> 00:41:01,289
friendly because nobody is you shouldn't

863
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:04,979
be too paranoid about your co-workers

864
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:07,499
and other people in this room your

865
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:09,089
friends whatever but there's actually no

866
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:10,410
reason why you shouldn't for example

867
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,450
lock your screen when you leave the room

868
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,850
because they might leave the room and it

869
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:17,980
might be unattended at

870
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:21,049
it's not I know as cultural people or

871
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:23,060
simple animals that we are we like to

872
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,640
show our trust by

873
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:28,370
maybe not locking the screen saying well

874
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,650
you know I trust you that's fine but

875
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:32,630
still if you just lock your screen and

876
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:36,710
do other small things other people won't

877
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:38,780
think any any lower view and you will

878
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:43,660
protect yourself a lot better and

879
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:46,370
probably your enterprise as well and

880
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:49,310
this morning in your talk I'm going to

881
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:55,370
call you now um you said something along

882
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:56,930
the lines here so much writing you said

883
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,029
something along the lines if your

884
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:03,440
security team consists of just one

885
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:07,280
person then you're screwed right yeah

886
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,320
and very often a lot of the security

887
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,790
teams I think probably every team but

888
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,550
we're talking security teams right now

889
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,230
will have one or two people who are very

890
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:18,350
enthusiastic about what they're doing

891
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,540
and the rest probably just doing their

892
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:23,420
job and the people who are really

893
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:27,410
enthusiastic about it very often hack in

894
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,360
their spare time are active in

895
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:31,190
communities and so on and so forth

896
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,230
and they are very often regarded as the

897
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,660
rock stars so when they an holiday and

898
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,880
something minor happens very often this

899
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,460
doesn't get solved until the person

900
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,330
comes back and solves it because people

901
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:46,670
are a lazy and B there's another trait

902
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,680
of rock stars very often if you solve a

903
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,540
problem and you don't solve it the way

904
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,660
they would have solved it you're going

905
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:56,960
to hear they hear that for weeks or

906
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,700
months or longer and so people just keep

907
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,990
their hands off the stuff and say well

908
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:06,500
when this back you can fix it or she I

909
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:09,379
still think we should spread the

910
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,350
knowledge and I still think that rock

911
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,600
stars in the industry are except the B

912
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:17,390
farmers probably rock stars in the

913
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,130
industry are not a good thing because

914
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,850
very often this is not about knowledge

915
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:26,880
but about ego and in the end you should

916
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:28,740
try to distribute the knowledge and this

917
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,390
your responsibility because very often

918
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,058
if you give people responsibility for

919
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:35,670
something they care about it more than

920
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:39,930
if it's somebody else's problem

921
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:41,579
and again if you gently can nudge people

922
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,940
out of their comfort zone give them

923
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:47,579
tasks that they usually would say I

924
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:50,910
can't do that but he can they're going

925
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:58,890
to grow so more or less you help them as

926
00:43:50,910 --> 00:44:01,109
well and then one of the I have no idea

927
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,450
I only worked one year in Scotland so I

928
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:06,900
can't really comment on the state of the

929
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:09,509
industry in the UK but in Germany in

930
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,609
larger companies it's so important to

931
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:12,200
pass the blame and cover you ask you

932
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:16,170
wouldn't believe it

933
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,950
and I kind of hate that because it

934
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:24,049
doesn't really solve anything so there

935
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:27,240
was this incident where major services

936
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:31,319
stopped working at the company I was

937
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:33,808
working for back then and we were

938
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:36,359
frantically trying to figure out what

939
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:38,849
happened and how to actually get

940
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:40,470
everything up and running again and my

941
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:43,460
friend boss came into the office and

942
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:46,078
said who requested the change and

943
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,329
sometimes when I'm in a situation like

944
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,630
that and frantically typing away the

945
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:54,900
keyboard I can be short of words and she

946
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:58,079
maybe even not so polite and said who

947
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,900
cares so I got pulled away from my

948
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,180
keyboard and she was very adamant in

949
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,309
telling me that this is no tone just

950
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,509
picture and she needs to know who

951
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:12,329
requested the change and part of me was

952
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:14,069
furious because I would love to solve

953
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:17,220
the problem now and not talk to you lady

954
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:18,990
but of course we went for the locks we

955
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,149
found out who requested the change and

956
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:24,959
she gave a sigh of relief

957
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:27,390
ha it was not not ask then why does that

958
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,819
matter she said well I'm going to meet

959
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:33,558
with my boss thank you very much and if

960
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:36,920
I can say it wasn't us then I'm covered

961
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:40,820
well I'm not working there anymore so

962
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,460
should give you an idea why but this is

963
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,310
really something well I think we need to

964
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,680
stay neutral it really really doesn't

965
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:51,250
matter who left the candle burning as

966
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,799
long as the house is burning once

967
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:57,080
everything's been dealt with it's really

968
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,180
a good idea to find out the reasons for

969
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,529
the incident because if you don't find

970
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:04,490
out the reasons it might happen again

971
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:07,520
and then you can improve things but just

972
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:11,209
to say yeah it was then again doesn't

973
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:14,780
help anybody and so with the plea for

974
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:17,450
that it is just try not to pass the

975
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,640
blame try to see how you can actually

976
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:22,040
improve your processes so that this

977
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,240
can't be happen it can't happen anymore

978
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:29,720
despite then or whoever it was that did

979
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,459
that because otherwise by passing the

980
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,410
blame we're not really solving anything

981
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,400
are we

982
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:39,379
and to finish it off I'm slightly over

983
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,030
time but we have still a few minutes I'm

984
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,870
sure the next talk right I thought I

985
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:46,850
have 45 minutes but the usual suspect we

986
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,500
don't have the money it would be cynical

987
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,990
to say that if you don't get the money

988
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:54,170
in today's climate you're doing it wrong

989
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:56,779
and it's not helping so okay if you

990
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:59,420
don't have the money to do everything

991
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,600
you want or to buy from lenders or to

992
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,480
buy hardware try to do it yourself you

993
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:08,480
can exchange the money that you need

994
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:12,170
with time that you have if you have

995
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,350
neither time nor money I'm getting to

996
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,550
that

997
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:18,920
but sometimes you can find something

998
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,480
open-source an open-source product that

999
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,760
is going to do what you want but you

1000
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,140
have to do it yourself and you have to

1001
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,300
configure it you have to run it you have

1002
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:28,430
to monitor it it's a little bit more

1003
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,590
work than just buying an appliance and

1004
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:33,620
you remember what I told you about about

1005
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:35,900
appliances anyway we don't have the

1006
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,839
people it's next thing and I'm not just

1007
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,690
talking about not getting the money to

1008
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,910
get new people on board but again I

1009
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:47,810
think the UK faces the same problem as

1010
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:49,759
Germany we have way more companies

1011
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:50,750
looking for people than people looking

1012
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,720
for jobs

1013
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:56,359
in the cyber industry I also think this

1014
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:59,598
is the problem one aspect of the problem

1015
00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:03,078
is because the recruiters have a very

1016
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,839
specific mindset like this need to needs

1017
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:09,890
to be a CISSP with at least 10 years in

1018
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:15,140
this and that and that shouldn't be

1019
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:17,000
older than 20 should eat I had a nice

1020
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,700
email somewhere but I didn't find it

1021
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,640
anymore from the guy who was very

1022
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:25,819
heavily involved with angular and he

1023
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,470
responded to a shop offer saying that

1024
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,210
they needed somebody with 10 years of

1025
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:31,669
angular experience and said you know

1026
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:36,950
it's only been around for six years they

1027
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:39,079
told him to shut up and we do have the

1028
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:42,950
people we just have to look a little bit

1029
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:47,060
differently at what we want I mean this

1030
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:49,250
the talk by in which was in its essence

1031
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,650
also saying if you don't change our

1032
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,900
mindset about whom we want in the

1033
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:56,359
industry we only get the same people and

1034
00:48:53,900 --> 00:49:00,170
that will change nothing if I summarize

1035
00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:01,549
that correct and the last thing is you

1036
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,530
might say this is never going to work

1037
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,450
for my company got two things about that

1038
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:07,250
the narrative thing has to if you can

1039
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:10,069
improve your company or your security

1040
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,540
just a little bit by stealing a few of

1041
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:14,720
these ideas which I hope you will do

1042
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:16,160
that is very good and if you have the

1043
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,259
feeling that you can't change anything

1044
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,420
at your company you don't have the time

1045
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,369
you don't have the money and you will

1046
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,950
never improve anything there and it's

1047
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:27,319
frustrating then I urge you to watch

1048
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,720
your mental health and get a job at a

1049
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:31,460
different company because at the end of

1050
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,930
the day if you can't change anything by

1051
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,200
what you're doing and you're getting

1052
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:38,890
just frustrated then really seriously

1053
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,430
thinking about maybe there's another

1054
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:47,210
another company you'd like to work for

1055
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:49,790
so yeah basically if you see a lamp and

1056
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:51,530
rub it and see that symbol it doesn't

1057
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:56,569
really mean you get granted free wishes

1058
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:58,430
so if you're running slow with your

1059
00:49:56,569 --> 00:50:00,859
mental health or whatever you have

1060
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:05,259
whatever it is you do for your company

1061
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:07,520
then just think about either

1062
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,860
getting into a different state of mind

1063
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,070
not taking everything too seriously or

1064
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:15,620
changing the company so this being still

1065
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:29,900
fun I don't have any key takeaways for

1066
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:34,069
you but I've tried to take away keys are

1067
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:38,150
there any questions so one question I

1068
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:41,030
have or comment so when you talk about

1069
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:43,670
people and insider threats in that

1070
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:46,040
offering one of the things as always I

1071
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,920
Security's not my responsibility

1072
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:53,960
what do you say to that we're trying to

1073
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:55,400
tackle that by actually at our company

1074
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,740
we're trying it from a different angle

1075
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,320
we're doing a lot of security awareness

1076
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:03,439
workshops and stuff for the people at

1077
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,690
home because if they have some kind of

1078
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,760
better security at home they will

1079
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,620
translate that to a better security in

1080
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,450
the company because I know that that

1081
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:13,400
kind of mindset where people say you

1082
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:14,990
know when I'm working at the company I

1083
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,290
expect other people to do the security

1084
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:19,549
because I'm not within the security team

1085
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,860
we're trying to get the point across

1086
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:24,140
that everybody's doing Security but not

1087
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:27,290
in a way that it's their sole

1088
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,120
responsibility just in a way that you

1089
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,980
know like locking your screens and

1090
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,900
things like that we're trying to get to

1091
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,320
them there will be some boneheads who

1092
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,880
will always say it's not my problem but

1093
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,530
with not locking their screens those

1094
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,560
bone has very often find out but they

1095
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:44,420
somehow invited the whole team to bagels

1096
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,210
or doughnuts or beer or whatever and

1097
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:56,180
then they will lock the screen

1098
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:57,800
so any more questions thank you please

1099
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,980
take a few keys and have a nice

1100
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,980
afternoon
