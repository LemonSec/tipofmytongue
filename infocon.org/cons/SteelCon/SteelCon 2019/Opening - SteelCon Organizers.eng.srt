25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:21,699
allowed in goodie bags this year is the

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,360
biggest by volume goodie bag thing we've

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,850
had yet I think it was about four of

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,810
four big car loads to get all the stuff

29
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,829
here a lot of stuff just to sort of give

30
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,869
you a quick run-through of what you've

31
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:42,479
got you've obviously got the nice brandy

32
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:50,380
towels the jelly babies all sorts and

33
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:52,899
wine gums I think they are there those

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,759
who don't know the facets factory is in

35
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:58,350
Sheffield stopping Hillsborough so

36
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,939
they're all made locally same

37
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,820
Henderson's relish it's been made in

38
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:05,919
Sheffield since 1885 it's a local

39
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,658
delicacy if you don't know about it it's

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,658
similar to what's the sauce but better

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,909
it it's at least vegetarian it might

42
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,560
even be vegan I'm not sure but it's good

43
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:22,048
gluten-free and approved by vegetarians

44
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,409
and vegan so hopefully it'll do for

45
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,409
everybody

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,238
most of you will have a teabag thanks to

47
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,280
Scott story whatever it is he decided to

48
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,569
represent York from the teabags or

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,489
anybody from the other side of ten eyes

50
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:46,798
we do have some lengths shitty I guess

51
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:48,690
you ought to rebell well that's we got a

52
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,629
nice simple hearing you can all work out

53
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,160
what to do with that we've given

54
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,500
everybody a Bitcoin this year with

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,500
splashed out everybody's got one Bitcoin

56
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,440
you all know millionaires and you know

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,030
all penniless I on the back there is

58
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,190
some crypto if you can solve it well

59
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,780
done you've won a prize I've no idea

60
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,329
what it means but if you can solve it

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:15,150
come and tell me what else we got in

62
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:18,569
here well that's a little bit you've got

63
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:22,049
these little triangles these were picked

64
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:27,418
up off Alibaba or one of the big Chinese

65
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:30,959
sites they are GPS each bluetooth kind

66
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:33,239
of tracker things the idea is you've got

67
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,400
an app on your phone you pair bluetooth

68
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,049
to this whenever they go over to

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,329
connection it the phone remembers where

70
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,150
it last saw the tag and it can tell you

71
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,040
where you lost your bag or whatever I

72
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:48,260
figured for about 50 P apiece there

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,569
can't be any security in these pack them

74
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,798
like let me see what you can do I

75
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,819
assumed it turned on by default so I

76
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,510
don't think they're any buttons or

77
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,619
anything on them so yeah see see how

78
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,298
many people in this room even track

79
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,650
though they click if you squeeze them

80
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:08,579
that might be turning them on I don't

81
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:11,430
know the last but most important thing

82
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:14,810
in your goody bags is Woody's wonder

83
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,370
cube your wonder where your life is gone

84
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:21,450
the cubes you have got in your bag are

85
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,219
not solved yet it may look like than the

86
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,830
right colors it might look like in the

87
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,289
right orient

88
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,560
nations that doesn't mean anything they

89
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:31,270
are not solved well that's the basic way

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,840
if you want to solve just by colors go

91
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:40,680
for it if you want to do the slightly

92
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:43,688
harder version turn to page where is it

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,490
so it's page 20 in your books you've got

94
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:51,159
a crossword solve the crossword decode

95
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:56,680
the cube solve the cube to match the

96
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:59,979
crossword simple the salt cube does not

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,139
look anything like you would expect you

98
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,300
can't do it by orientation you can't do

99
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,539
it by color you can't really do by

100
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,430
anything apart from the crossword and as

101
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,560
far as I know this is the only solved

102
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,000
one in the world at the moment so if you

103
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,819
want to check whether you've solved

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,729
yours and come afire me and we can

105
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:23,469
compare them yeah so have a play I

106
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:26,080
reckon we will have at least one solve

107
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:27,310
by lunchtime so there's the challenge

108
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,128
see if anybody can do it

109
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,129
it took me with the kind of the cheat

110
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:39,159
sheets good hour and a half to get it

111
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:40,960
done so yeah see what we can do all

112
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,879
right all the stuff we've got on we've

113
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,219
got a quiet room this year for people

114
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,319
who get a bit stressed out by all the

115
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,819
noise all of the busyness sighs then

116
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,430
everything we have to put on a nice

117
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,930
quiet room we haven't decided whether is

118
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,020
yet just because if people ruin round

119
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,419
saw stuff this morning Lizzie Lizzie

120
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,979
will leave he's over there this is going

121
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,500
to be ruining it for us unfortunately

122
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:04,599
she is also speaking at 10 o'clock in

123
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,139
the first track and the first onset of

124
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:10,180
slot so when Lizzie is finished we're

125
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,460
going to sort out where the the quiet

126
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,409
room is we're going to set it up and by

127
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,150
half 10 or something it should be open

128
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,379
we've got a couple of options just want

129
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,508
to make sure you get the best room for

130
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,279
it yeah

131
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,930
Lizzie will be in there all day most of

132

133
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,779
yeah sleeping in the corner it's just

134
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,029
place to get away from everything if you

135
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,430

136

the goodies the sponsors pay for the

172
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,240
whole event venues they pay for the food

173
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,880
that you're getting to pay for the party

174
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,250

178
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,020
think they get in value for money they

179
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,450
don't come back again so go chat to them

180
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,400

181
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,719

182
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,549

to move have a chart we've got community

187
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:45,099
sponsors as well and I said this on

188
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,470
Twitter a while ago in a lot of other

189
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,870
industries we would be competing against

190
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,980
the b-sides thoughts photons all the

191
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,730
other events

192
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:57,070
but in this industry there are friends

193
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,709
so we just pair up with them can we

194
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,540
support on these these supporters go to

195
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,979
come to our corn but go to theirs as

196
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,920
well they've all got something slightly

197
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,600
different to offer I'm swimming up north

198
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,029
somewhere down south somewhere east some

199
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,240
West get to your local ones and give

200
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:14,949
them some sports as well I'm sure

201
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,329
special quick mention for Halle Munich

202
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:20,439
because they've put on the biggest

203
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:23,500
building and stuff they've run a they've

204
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,490

205
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:31,000

206
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,500
NCIS but it's GCHQ accredited so that

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,940
course is one of just a few in the

208
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,709
country that's properly accredited plan

209
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,980

chat with the catering crew and and they

217
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,410

274
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,640
going around the sticker area somewhere

275
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,250
down that way if you brought anything

276
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,380
long for it drop it off at a crew room

277
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,390
or drop it off by the stickers we'll

278
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,130
take it off your hands but everything

279
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,890
from books we got some random or bits of

280
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,930
hardware no guarantees on it no

281
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:59,170
warranties on it pay a fair price and

282
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,839
take it away anything's left at the end

283
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:05,469

284
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:09,670
it responsibly we've got the sticker

285
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,260
Emporium again yeah I think so most of

286
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,050
you have found it's already this year

287
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,660

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,199
6 all on the on the road so we'll pass

298
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,879
it on and try and sort of keep it going

299
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,059
because it's a great way to raise money

300
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:50,110
for charity and everybody likes tickles

301
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,089
spare goodie bags we always end up

302
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,160
having some stuff left weird up in the

303
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:57,369
the odd position where just price breaks

304
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,618
we only need 450 of things but we're in

305
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,809
departments by 500 is achieved by 500

306
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:03,910
and 450 so we'll probably have stuff

307
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:07,299
left and that is left we will be selling

308

361
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,769

362
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:53,399
versions we had the meaty in the

363
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:55,170
vegetarian the meaty was vanilla ice

364
00:16:53,399 --> 00:17:00,560
cream with pork scratchings and

365
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:03,059
applesauce nicer than you think

366
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,599

367
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:09,030
of a tangy twist and the vegetarian

368
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,549
option was mushy peas in northern I

369

398
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,629
looks like that used to be a sense of

399
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,930
popular music if any of you were here as

400
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,930

big bar tab but we've also got a lot of

405

406
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:53,110
drinkers but people who like to refresh

407
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,030
themselves so rather than just open the

408
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,310
bar we've given up beer tour because

409
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,100

410
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,740

going well we'll hand out a few more if

414
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,150
we were running low we won't but we

415
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,230
usually end up getting mostly wet

416
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,290
through sore to a.m. when it all

417
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:17,050
finishes so a hero tokens the past

418

419
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:25,360
sponsored that Saturday Sunday morning

420
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,740

421
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,770
Mike was big in the community he

422
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,470
sponsored poopoo fests his quest from

423
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:36,220
first year all the other sponsors

424
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,890
its invoices and bank transfers and 30

425
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,110
days notice and all this stuff standard

426
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,180
business Mike who's going to sponsor it

427
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,250
yes how much I told them but

428
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,020
okay turn for the day had me a brown

429
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,210
envelope with cash in it said you want

430
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,040
receipt but no that's it there you go so

431
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,230
that was kind of Mike's character even

432
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,730
supported it since day one and so it's

433
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,340
now been renamed the Mike camp pew pew

434
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,140
first two games

435
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,280
unfortunately somebody sneaked in before

436
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,800
us we normally have about 10:00 10:30

437
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,600
start but some misleading boards for the

438
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,020
birthday party we couldn't really kick

439
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,590
them out so we started at half nine to

440
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,710
roughly half our games we should be

441
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:17,169
finished by about half 10 sign-up sheets

442
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,730
run registration was about 28 slots I

443
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,720
