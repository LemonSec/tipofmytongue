1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,379
why well it's going instruction so first

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:14,010
a lot - Bryan Walton I run a company

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:16,770
that money-grubber hurdle also I helped

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,710
a long tear at lungi three slides did

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,060
scotland's and bristle this year as well

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,690
how about the rookie track with mr.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,150
David up there swamps it besides the

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,830
pool - it was good venue okay

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,009
I'm also imagine that they're farmers

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,030
that happen to be on track one right now

11
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:35,850
I'm sure it's just a coincidence that

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,829
that's happened normally our soldiers

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,079
who we are yeah do we have any network

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,140
guys in here who's dedicated you

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,989
predominately do networking yeah you

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,260
probably have know all this already and

17
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:51,480
what you guys do you press server guys

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,809
developer okay white girls I think okay

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,190
we've got that Hollywood is ruined IT

20
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,530
security net four-year especially in

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,379
network security you watch anything for

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,940
example like ever seen a film Fievel

23
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,860
Harrison Hall gets a thing from the fax

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,020
machine scans a screen because basically

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,179
the printers gone not gonna happen you

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,310
know it's like the I mean I mean they

27
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:12,600
feel like firewall a lot new one it's

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,009
going to take me with it and then

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,380
straight through that it's like it's

30
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,240
unrealistic and people get some

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,100
realistic view of networking especially

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,899
and that was security it just doesn't

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,949
happen and probably is basically design

34
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,259
companies like Cisco and juniper got

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,719
massive websites which basing they and

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,359
promote design things and by industry

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,490
why don't you tie expecially cuz she's

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,229
got forward the people for computers

39
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,719
just cuz your work in the industry like

40
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,959
medicine you've got regulation their

41
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:53,158
insurance got their own ones there's no

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:57,689
two networks in the same so okay okay

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,329
fine more juniper and that's thing right

44
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,979
okay but basically why presume design if

45
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,509
you basically designers who are really

46
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,249
doing their job very well you'll hear a

47
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,509
lot of support guys going we'll go

48
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:08,190
around for that and that's pretty much

49
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,410
because the design team spent that

50
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,460
they're getting do a lot Rams aren't

51
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,530
really what you'll be doing especially

52
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:18,580
mastery point as you go forward and

53
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,770
the everything else all here should work

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,510
on most switches in home network home or

55
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,450
home rooters should be able to do most

56
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,100
of stuff on there

57
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,440
not all home route isn't hook but all

58
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,700
nulls vendors codes the same basically

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,740
it's um I kind of lost my track for a

60
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,450
plaintiff right so let's go into the

61
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,890
traffic nothing on your net which be on

62
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,540
the tip floor if you leave we'll have

63
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,649
some window some work you know roughly

64
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,120
how it's going to take you from leaving

65
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,620
the house to your office you know route

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
you're gonna take and you know your

67
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,120
deviations it's predictable nothing on

68
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,859
your hoping on your computer network

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,750
should be unpredictable you

70
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,790
unpredictable traffic you've got

71
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,989
problems so you know traffic takes two

72
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,670
milliseconds to get from their stem is

73
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,989
75 milliseconds setting three

74
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,359
milliseconds but there's something

75
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:05,020
different from the norm needs

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,380
investigating you know saying with me

77
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,630
with that may well not move that well

78
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,060
from a network point of view we say kind

79
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,040
differently you kind of see it like that

80
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,560
we delivered it to the system what

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,920
happens it happens the problem of that

82
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,680
is developers and people work in apps

83
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,880
and databases base it's like different

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,130
they see it like this everything's never

85
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,340
fall if it doesn't work it must be the

86
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,480
network because yes exactly thanks

87
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,670
anyway

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,290
this base means that network guys tend

89
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,790
to do a lot of troubleshooting when he

90
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,500
ends up with them saying have you tried

91
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,739
turned off not again they do that it

92
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,519
works in you feel like this get that a

93
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:52,150
lot but again go back to Hollywood this

94
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,820
is how high would betrays security IT

95
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,829
security oh well lots of stuff what

96
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,150
clients tell the screens based there but

97
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,220
in essence we all know from a street

98
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,720
professional or a pen tester you more

99
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,430
likely not be looking stuff like that

100
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,950
you're more likely to see in that on a

101
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,390
more regular basis because that is we're

102
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,609
gonna find all your problems that you

103
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,130
can look for other issues that's it but

104
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,200
then look for the matrix if we go

105
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,200
through the layers one two three four

106
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,358
because that's what we have to do with

107
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,890
layer one obviously physical stuff says

108
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,799
here you route as you switches two

109
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:26,349
firewalls network cards you cabling a

110
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,060
couple of 802 not freeze all your

111
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,909
cabling fiber optics a concealer

112
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,880
is we want to start the RF bluetooth

113
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,440
thermocouple on those standards reason

114
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,840
why'd you attack this layer is basically

115
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,690
gay access you gonna need access onto

116
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,280
network so you will do that one point

117
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,370
assistance or just too disruptive just

118
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,900
the basically remove it some think you

119
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,290
have the capability if you think can't

120
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,599
have it nor can a for those problems

121
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,910
that layer one tend to be

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,610
misconfigurations they tend to be some

123
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,280
of them patch think Sun sank off it's

124
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,360
going to be something like that um and

125
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,710
there's no defense

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,270
there's defense yeah good espares

127
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,729
budgets really don't help try get a

128
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,280
budget for spares I'd done about you lot

129
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,320
but I I can't wherever I work no chance

130
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,010
again spared so I've got pulled away

131
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,280
again this if you monitor eyes it so I'm

132
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,960
24 foot Cisco switches these are five or

133
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,229
four different models which the rough

134
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,729
cost a couple weeks ago now if you well

135
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:31,349
if you lose one of those she eventually

136
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:35,080
is 24 people she pain in ten pounds now

137
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,240
look adds up pretty damn quick if it

138
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,659
takes you two days think that switch

139
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,950
back replaced because no one's working

140
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,210
factually both switches now cost you

141
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,289
that and just not yeah that's that's the

142
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,690
argument need to give these business

143
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:51,370
take a look if you want me to if you

144
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,539
hope to have spares can I have some

145
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,600
spares base and this is the reason why

146
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,280
monitor Iser soon as you do that then

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,560
you can play around say there's me

148
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,770
Hartman having the fourth four thousand

149
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,150
pounds which said I do nothing well it's

150
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,260
go be that much why this networks

151
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,450
wireless networks you've got to see lot

152
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,919
footprints and you want to make sure

153
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,110
your footprint doesn't go anywhere you

154
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,219
don't want it to go for example outside

155
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,039
the building record you're a really good

156
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,690
job with this so these access point so

157
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,250
you can see where they you can take the

158
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,100
bright lights and probably more like

159
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,570
walls and stuff like that but you don't

160
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
want your access points next to sunny

161
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,940
wall because he is issuing

162
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,780
wireless into carpark unless you

163
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,930
operating some kind of carpark need

164
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,719
wanna say that's not good so wireless

165
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,949
networks are a bugbear because no

166
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:43,110
it's fun controls there's many ways be

167
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,399
controlling you go even buy paint so you

168
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,979
make things to disperse it but

169
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,360
ultimately if you're not look laughter

170
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:51,329
ey that's most companies on wireless

171
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,539
network now please please do some of

172
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:57,899
them seriously but we also look at job

173
00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:02,549
adverts this is job advert for a face in

174
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,989
Cheltenham now second light now they

175
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:08,429
should give you a clue to where place

176
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:11,039
inside this bargain is if you're going

177
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:13,979
employ a cisco CCIE or CCM please i want

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,308
to see Cynthia okay I don't see simply

179
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,599
screws in situ in Britain and I would

180
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:20,729
like to think that you are familiar with

181
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,339
protocols such as TCP let's get up BGP

182
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:26,909
at that point see simply a slightly more

183
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,559
so this now tells us what they're using

184
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:33,509
probably the technologies using there

185
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:37,589
are seasoned nexus using ACL is this is

186
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,539
very that only needs to be that but

187
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:41,789
someone an HR department when that we

188
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,709
need to be precise with this now we just

189
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:45,989
don't forget a CCMP make sure that's

190
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:48,809
easy and PTO certification and then ask

191
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:50,729
them questions don't don't advertise

192
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,449
what fitment you're using it's

193
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:53,188
ridiculous

194
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:59,009
and you see many adverts that is a great

195
00:07:53,189 --> 00:08:00,989
way of find out what companies ago this

196
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,649
is less do we need to go through this

197
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:06,058
you know lot laptops that kind of stuff

198
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,669
in wireless networks guess

199
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:10,679
don't let waived option network one good

200
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,919
tip like got quite well actually

201
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:15,688
other customer they had they ferment

202
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,549
problems with their wires over I got

203
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:19,439
into disable exhaust eighteen seven and

204
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,110
sixteen evening seven the more centers

205
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,339
nearly they use it work after that no

206
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,499
one's in the office no one should be

207
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:26,849
connecting to it so we bought cheaper

208
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:29,429
already tough and we've turned their

209
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:31,438
Wireless off at six o'clock we then put

210
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:33,659
that thing out the same SSID same

211
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,308
password just to see if everyone's lock

212
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,289
onto existing we're all logged onto it

213
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:41,250
well they shouldn't a they were so we

214
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:44,550
found and what we've measured but yeah

215
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,930
do that but just saving us people so

216
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,750
that's why stuff that's all pretty

217
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,069
common basic stuff but what's more in

218
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,070
tortoise is that you don't pull this

219
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,500
stuff and you push the network team off

220
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,620
she end up basically over 10 make half

221
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,990
duplex connections you know ultimately

222
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,190
the network team run the network there's

223
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,720
nothing on your environment which we

224
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,940
don't control I don't care how much is

225
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,300
the cost it is connected to my network

226
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll control that thank you very much

227
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,069
let's move it very interesting stuff

228
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,850
made to stuff is just not secure it

229
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:24,860
never has been never will be every layer

230
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:26,690
2 protocol spanning tree CDP o nibbly

231
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,750
bought of any security Mike's function

232
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,899
and so base it's very easy to attack and

233
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,730
just get furious me ham table boy for

234
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,730
enough MAC addresses you switch it's a

235
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,790
hub the HP protection if I throw enough

236
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,009
back dresses you PHP server

237
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:45,980
you've got no users network segmentation

238
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:49,250
yeah we'll come to that Spencer you ever

239
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,540
say local to 7 peripherals at CDP if I

240
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,850
can get that information from your

241
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,219
network I know what switch type using

242
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,470
images running some IP address

243
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,149
information like a pre Pio start

244
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,620
building up a morphing there's no reason

245
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:03,949
why computer needs to know that so to

246
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,170
say lot no user course and this is a

247
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:06,949
common sense man quite a lot someone

248
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,139
actually said to me we don't need

249
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:12,649
demands we have antivirus you try

250
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:16,130
explain some widely separately that the

251
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:18,019
problem is and without

252
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,899
segmenting your network you've got a

253
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,829
flat network it's like this room

254
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,649
everyone could talk to everyone in this

255
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,839
room there's no restrictions you place a

256
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,819
VLAN we've now got a door where these

257
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,510
two laughs that video we can put some

258
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:34,880
controls in and yeah I think this

259
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,860
catalyzes most systems nowadays will

260
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,990
happen but during that stuff they may

261
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,160
have four different server types and

262
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,110
they have these implanted application

263
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,990
servers there's no reason why they

264
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,209
shouldn't all beam different feelings

265
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,490
simple fact basically one it makes it

266
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,130
even scalable but to you know start

267
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,139
securing it if you run out might be

268
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,500
dresses on there easily that's that's

269
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,300
fine

270
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,000
adding that feeling that's not when I

271
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,769
see quite a lot Spiceworks Women's Forum

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,079
run out of IP addresses what do I do

273
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,910
I'll make it safe for me fine you've

274
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,540
never IP addresses that implies they've

275
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,880
got that no

276
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,709
it means all this Knussen's every way

277
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,900
and another day man

278
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,850
so you need to do there you're changing

279
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,280
nothing that's existing that's working

280
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,310
you're amending something and adding to

281
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,949
it so zero risk but you changed exp

282
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,369
scope hunter Center stuff's going to

283
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,190
change that's ridiculous

284
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,770
he loves your friends and be able to

285
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,090
stop bad things happening in network

286
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:35,740
predators feel great from host to host

287
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,790
and taking stuff had took me ages okay

288
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,270
if you looking for a solid database

289
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:44,900
server thank you they said it doesn't

290
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,520
even seem set however we should try that

291
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,290
means no reason take my snake places

292
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,360
where we good stuff is should be allowed

293
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,890
access to internet your wireless active

294
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,960
users shouldn't have direct access to it

295
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,140
either because why would you have that

296
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,450
on your shoe and northern or even our

297
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,580
users via printers printer Disney access

298
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,770
to they PI server the admin users don't

299
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,200
I think that many users you should jump

300
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,660
server control that jump server live

301
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,150
that access to where your service you

302
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,000
can thing control that ups that stop

303
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,590
serve even love the crap out of it allow

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,020
access to mapping users to their and

305
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,740
then jumps the other servers yeah that's

306
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,130
me

307
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,570
it's a logical security now you could

308
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,400
trim as having a flat network we got

309
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,260
when this file will defend an economic

310
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,030
staff but this is going to stop half the

311
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,189
stuff that you trying look and go to

312
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,870
stay if you start logging you'll find

313
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,700
stuff you'll see stuff that people are

314
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,680
doing that should be doing misconfigured

315
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,250
servers but basically it doesn't need to

316
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,380
towards site

317
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,570
don't talk to it more than likely your

318
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,400
web server dude people come to you web

319
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,640
server web servers going to take my

320
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,010
server back off back again so why now

321
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,760
access the day by cellar while access to

322
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,069
you know

323
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,360
printers I mean we can use just they

324
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,750
don't need access to the printer not

325
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,590
there there's that so they're free wheel

326
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:02,540
a free roof okay let's go to this so we

327
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,100
know that basically the communication

328
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,400
goes down the stacking it back up the

329
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,440
sadly it goes back the other way when

330
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,780
you on the same VLAN

331
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,510
basically I think users there to it uses

332
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,910
a resolution address resolution protocol

333
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,260
up it uses the MAC address doesn't use

334
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,500
the IP address to indicate when use the

335
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,800
Mac

336
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,390
yes so PC once took PC free we've got

337
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,030
Mac there's my create yes what happened

338
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,890
is PC one will beat them back dressed PC

339
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,470
treats them traffic so similar that

340
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,030
request covers a broadcast every host on

341
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,130
the deal and look at that if you've got

342
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,260
2/20 every host on the VLAN will get

343
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:39,380
that broadcast it also say well I'm this

344
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,870
IP address and his my MAC address top 30

345
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,780
will get that it'll send back a unicast

346
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,550
saying hey I'm this guy here's my MAC

347
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,589
address they'll then populate it into

348
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,420
the ARP tables and the switch roles

349
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,330
would make them only in its cam table so

350
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,069
next time you try to send from dc1 dc-3

351
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,150
it knows the mattress needs and send the

352
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,250
switch loads where both MAC addresses

353
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,870
are some more efficiently move it and

354
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,330
also there we go that's how things work

355
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,890
on a VLAN IP address it isn't really

356
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,510
used food thing my IP address or

357
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,980
everything they're not but you need the

358
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,160
IP address because it goes to the stack

359
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,250
but it's that but the proble of this is

360
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,170
that it's very easy to attack by the

361
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,300
middle of tactic used to be really

362
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,430
really effective especially for grabbing

363
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,449
credit and credit text because you've

364
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:25,310
achieved the traffic part and pretty

365
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,750
PTT has been a troublemaker okay honey

366
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,400
he basically wants to see what traffic

367
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,700
is between to them so what he basically

368
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,209
does is he tells both from hey those IP

369
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,340
addresses

370
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,680
here's the MAC address for it he tells

371
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:40,730
him that one tenth up and you get that

372
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,770
in the map table you should see that so

373
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,710
now all traffic from pc1 PC free was

374
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,970
going through there and if it's in clear

375
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,980
text hopefully it's all encrypted now

376
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,550
but if that's a view as you see traffic

377
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,740
player fruit and throw it back up you

378
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,060
still backup servers I've heard the

379
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,070
stories of people grabbing a whole

380
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,260
server backup couple of gigs were in

381
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,930
peak at you can reassemble it and print

382
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,180
jobs right through print jobs wrap the

383
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,069
whole packet capture reassemble the page

384
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,290
really really good really really

385
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:12,050
effective and that's problem with VLANs

386
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,930
so this is where it can get a bit

387
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,189
strange I'm quite proud of next slide it

388
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,020
took me a long time I hope you

389
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:23,110
appreciate it

390
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:23,110
host bus that's various it gets better

391
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,959
no copyright infringement there that's

392
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,800
not the real smiling but um hosts

393
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,119
isolation so what we can do can actually

394
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,769
prevent the layer to new stuff from

395
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,339
working which is really quite cool and

396
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:42,740
force it seems low free after the last

397
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,000
wall okay so let's just take example we

398
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,190
know that the you have know that the

399
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,470
default gateway if I can force the

400
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,940
traffic to use IP addressing why

401
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,790
Cancun's I get to treat it as if it's

402
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,440
traffic coming from outside the boa and

403
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,510
that work and put controller open I sell

404
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,459
them quite straightforward on a Cisco

405
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,139
switch is really straightforward it's

406
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:02,779
just super monster it's cool protected

407
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:05,029
and that forces the device is to use IP

408
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,649
addressing as validation about the MAC

409
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:08,779
address so that man and middle attack

410
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,500
now becomes completely impossible or not

411
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:15,019
the people so comes highly unlikely and

412
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,310
you basically get some you may name

413
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,899
attempted in massive victories but it

414
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,939
will state lateral movement we've got

415
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,529
devices illegality Network first thing I

416
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,639
did is going to run and hide big I'm

417
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:24,769
trying from one machine to that machine

418
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,230
machine correct credentials kept files

419
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,760
do have any to do growing height you can

420
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,079
prevent it by doing this once you put

421
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,089
that command even if you are doing at

422
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,380
home Reuters is million tick box and the

423
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:36,050
wireless security settings it can be

424
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:41,510
called IEP isolation or host isolation

425
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:43,880
the small business range Netgear HP and

426
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,010
Cisco they have that host isolation tip

427
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,589
box and they go easy you use that and if

428
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,620
they supposed to traffic up to their

429
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,810
free we then put Maceo inbound on the

430
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,250
VLAN saying this address range here

431
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,670
which is worth your home to a stranger

432
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,079
that VLAN don't allow it in from outside

433
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,279
because why would traffic becomes even

434
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,079
from that means that IP address range

435
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,429
from outside it's a good idea that

436
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,559
they're disputing to be lens on anyway

437
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:09,980
just in case we're crafting packets and

438
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,230
setting it's not free but ya know Mazen

439
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,959
but what they do under system runs on it

440
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,579
go slapping sends you defending it your

441
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,110
attacker they testify in a new way of

442
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,349
try and get from one host on the house

443
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,799
because effectively the traffic goes up

444
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:25,760
it's a gateway

445
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,410
be going is either you go from 10.30 hi

446
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,540
second I'm not allowed to traffic on

447
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,610
SOAPnet so you spots it as simple as

448
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,158
that really really works quite well I

449
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,439
had other permissions like since DHCP

450
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,390
snooping chasing the recall and now

451
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,400
obviously you think

452
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,090
yes be certain I'm different different

453
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,190
something that people that's too bad

454
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,500
ESP request goes in this MAC address I

455
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,570
need my kid rescues bestowed this yeah

456
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,799
have this like you just he gets IP

457
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:56,049
address switch then recalls the mattress

458
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:59,110
you're ugly just keep it at least I'm

459
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:01,360
looking HP server what we magazine are

460
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,129
what interfaces on now that by itself

461
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,110
isn't very interesting it's not doing

462
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,480
anything it's just just aches because we

463
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,090
do add dynamic art inspection we can do

464
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,850
some really cool stuff so switch smell

465
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,699
learns all these devices we've got the

466
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,730
HP take notice that that mattresses on

467
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,280
that interfaces social that IP address

468
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,710
PC tree is playing up again if anything

469
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,000
is different it won't work will just

470
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,450
drop the traffic you'll get a lot sewing

471
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,940
it back up so if you take the Mac dress

472
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,610
that won't work simply just want to send

473
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,299
traffic you can change the IP address it

474
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,600
won't work

475
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,620
it was simply not send traffic

476
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,439
effectively song you got a static

477
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,600
environment lots of PCs are those in

478
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,860
plots in virus now ORS a laptop me grab

479
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,899
of your static environment

480
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,418
this is gonna stop people to plugging

481
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,540
stuff in pretty easy and then you add

482
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,919
other stuff folks but as well but the

483
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,700
other thing that stops do it again and

484
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,880
that good slimy

485
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,470
Marvin that blade set reconnaissance

486
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,080
everyone picks off on there and pull

487
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,640
security so pull security isn't that

488
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,649
fair thing to do case on Cisco switch

489
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,940
Rizzo is easy to script on here I don't

490
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,299
think you introduce ourselves it's one

491
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,160
day people okay driver then computer by

492
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:17,440
people you turn on you see the

493
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,200
switchable called security command by

494
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,390
default as my MAC address on the top

495
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,790
example we've changed upbeat soo and

496
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,740
they specify the MAC addresses in use if

497
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,350
you try and plug any other device with a

498
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,179
MAC address or a third device it will go

499
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,040
over to say which basically shuts down

500
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,630
web traffic past you didn't administer

501
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,059
you have to go in there and we over

502
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,559
there see how things happened you get

503
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,840
that great moment we can don't shoot the

504
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,510
users ass off and doing say a permit the

505
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,610
bomb but my solution is to same thing

506
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,020
but we using sticky MAC addresses what

507
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,399
that does is it records the first MAC

508
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,339
address

509
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:53,369
see it keeps it when you unplug that

510
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:55,918
device the bottom this is 18 most times

511
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:57,209
s in seconds when that goes down that

512
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,529
MAC address there gets removed

513
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,839
waiting for the next MAC address to

514
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:03,450
arrive again if you're a static

515
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,918
environment yeah why not

516
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,419
this is simple I don't know send the

517
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,099
item for not doing it and if you want

518
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,979
say something it's complicated you're

519
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:13,439
getting paid issued job it's too

520
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:15,659
complicated don't find something easy to

521
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,029
do when you find out what it is let me

522
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:20,399
know obvious big form of this is you do

523
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:23,039
puts a lot hey where you have a static

524
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:25,080
environment gets what pulls air in

525
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,509
saving block didn't phone you up and get

526
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:34,649
the Silence of the Lambs come on I'm

527
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:37,769
hardly a people come on okay okay so go

528
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:40,978
ahead for now from an airport is it sold

529
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:45,450
to GDP as you know it as you use it for

530
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:47,909
DNS and all drivers up that in 1980 TCP

531
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,859
was invented 1981 there are be many

532
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,179
extensions and main new RFC's come out

533
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,678
for it but they're for extensions if

534
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:58,039
you're just using the box standard TC

535
00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:01,559
people Ned they're using a lot and SMTP

536
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:05,908
no one's ever come back and gone secure

537
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:07,589
SMTP probably even many reasons that you

538
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:09,359
know if you get bit bored next weekend

539
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:12,389
you can write the protocol fantastic

540
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,739
they not they easy to do but also by

541
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:18,839
SMTP server I can then say you're a URL

542
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:21,149
content filter spam filter and all that

543
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,789
was up to secure Mount North gone back

544
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:27,089
and make these protocols skilled by

545
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:29,999
design backward capability

546
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:31,559
paying the ass lot of money they've

547
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:34,200
proven that what will happen I'm messing

548
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,908
close this next generation web I don't

549
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,359
know whatever but this is the problem

550
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:41,129
vendors aren't doing no one securing

551
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,918
this stuff that was going back and going

552
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:45,478
oh we can do this better so we have to

553
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,639
live with what we've gone so we've got

554
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:49,409
our network here so what we can do is we

555
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,839
can secure stuff so if we've got our

556
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,099
user there are one user we know we

557
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,950
should be talking to these other users

558
00:21:53,099 --> 00:22:00,220
we now have a block that our perception

559
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,870
we make a constructivist isolation

560
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,460
done there's no way to ensure wireless

561
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,979
network there's no reason this sub

562
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,679
instance that so we'd block that all the

563
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,710
detainees for the item user or even

564
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,270
printers as well I mean the database

565
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:17,590
service usually going to as well the

566
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:20,559
printers or my bugbear well who here

567
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,070
manages printers where's the last time

568
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,000
updated the firmware your printer no

569
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,090
there's last time updating the firmware

570
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,950
on a Cisco switch but no reason exactly

571
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,510
those last make it patch your servers no

572
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,110
no I can believe that

573
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:37,419
but seriously yeah there's patches you

574
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,979
attach to second film you might have

575
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:41,289
felt a slight or you may do it

576
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,850
immediately but I've seen with option

577
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,330
boxes which have been up for like five

578
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,280
years

579
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,889
like a half years in fact as well as an

580
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,730
update sir it was 2012 she was last

581
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:54,820
rebooted and no applies downtown on the

582
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,110
Cisco device one everybody and you

583
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,220
printer does need access the into there

584
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,330
but it doesn't need to be updated

585
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,549
but seriously factory in going the issue

586
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,760
security updates very often actually

587
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:08,200
plus it's been lot of up comes up that

588
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,210
user doesn't need access to these two

589
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,440
things like most others and the

590
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,870
application service probably except

591
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,600
probably a ghost in Durham so you know

592
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,449
traffic lives and your th piece thousand

593
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,250
to main controls that concept is so you

594
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,010
should local access it doesn't need that

595
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:26,559
access the study you've made your lab a

596
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,480
much more friendly place to the traffic

597
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,200
and harder for someone to move about

598
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,530
without and yeah Leon science going look

599
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,880
traffic you shouldn't be here and more

600
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,928
importantly you should apply to all the

601
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,330
big loads yeah

602
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,890
don't just one of them and do is looking

603
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,610
to VPN do something to the wireless

604
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:47,850
users you know see the what is I mean

605
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:51,250
these to talk to something only allow it

606
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:56,740
so at least this it's something ages to

607
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:58,090
find that font and so documentation any

608
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,080
with just a few up until today invention

609
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:04,980
ventilation it really is true if you

610
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,780
don't know what you got hacky manager

611
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,610
simple as that if it's on your network

612
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,530
chances are it might cause your problem

613
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,240
you should know what's on your network

614
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,428
if there's something on your network you

615
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,140
you don't know

616
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,500
you don't control the network simple as

617
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,390
that

618
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,510
that's our schedule how is it connected

619
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,460
Network I'm a big advocate patcher

620
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,350
scheduled it going up some brain labels

621
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,409
put the same number on the each end of

622
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,750
the cable I think I've had you somewhere

623
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:34,779
it's just someone's late week tales from

624
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:39,010
there a pimple number one for Dad

625
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:40,240
yeah if I end your cable would you be

626
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,029
able to tell me where that cable come

627
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,159
from I just randomly picked a Bop in

628
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:46,690
your environment probably got that the

629
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,120
vet numbers of it they do patent

630
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,669
schedule yeah the cable still be removed

631
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,779
there's still an issue but now we

632
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,720
massively reduced in that time you got

633
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:57,669
to find plugins it mean that's really

634
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,789
simple to do that live or is but once

635
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,899
you've done it maintaining this doing a

636
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,820
lot more things you come in licensed in

637
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:05,168
network companies now realized they

638
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,879
can't sell you a new switch every five

639
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,890
years so they license some of their

640
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,539
features on there but it's important

641
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,760
that when the licenses are hot because

642
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:14,470
that's when the snows stop working

643
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,789
but most license I have and license

644
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,440
management again they'd be surprised

645
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:18,940
about people they don't realize they did

646
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,020
it that having any email from the vendor

647
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,690
saying hey there's something three

648
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,370
months doesn't happen like it's not

649
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,490
working you didn't want scramble get the

650
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,649
budget yeah this part I could just be

651
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,450
that again whereas in the moment so you

652
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:32,770
see an IP address showing you know that

653
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,570
that IP address range dissociate with

654
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,190
the wireless users that IP address range

655
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,629
is associated to predators another

656
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,779
reason to segment a network because

657
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,059
they're your groups ex-con sense it's

658
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:45,940
not for this know what reason ice needs

659
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:49,149
a lot of network tool is that we need to

660
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,370
know what protocols what pulse these

661
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:53,260
grill across network you have is a date

662
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,299
basically Lange crew does need for for

663
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,520
free yeah it's not no web traffic going

664
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,320
there so it's important need to know

665
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,700
what's going to get work because you

666
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,950
could be blocking before that can start

667
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,450
work instructions that they want the

668
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,929
same days day

669
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,250
business as usual write it down it may

670
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:13,260
sound stupid because you do it every day

671
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,760
but especially like legal stuff

672
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,649
admissible as evidence in court and he's

673
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,850
determined in business artifact you may

674
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:20,678
do that if you can prove it's a

675
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,168
repeatable step and how he treats that

676
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,920
log so it could be blades of that person

677
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:26,470
logged in

678
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,180
it is great but you can't use that

679
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,980
corporate machine time I say how do we

680
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,080
treat the look I retrieved it like such

681
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,550
and such mmm prove it

682
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,409
and then you give them a copy of your

683
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,540
good loves me they don't go through

684
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,160
there yes it's a review instead but

685
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,820
without that repeatable step that looks

686
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,200
not good BL deuce is it's worthless and

687
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,389
notice that you get new people in this

688
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,010
is how we do stuff it's all about that

689
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,010
and I just ate you pretty fine we'll

690
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,390
find more ways what do you use though

691
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:57,150
hello there we like this who doesn't

692
00:26:52,390 --> 00:27:01,090
have a network diagram oh yes

693
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:04,780
you're lying okay then that's how's it

694
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:07,149
going something okay should I go oh no

695
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,700
showing it where is it we don't have one

696
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,960
and that's annoying because they came

697
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,360
once you've got that word diagramming

698
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,670
then monetize the diagram so let's

699
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,709
switch yeah that's my cost X amount of

700
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:30,370
money if it's down you know how much

701
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:31,720
they put on the diagram the IP address

702
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,800
Skinner could be more precise though

703
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,450
because you could have might be helpers

704
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,460
not for informational no I mean there's

705
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,350
a separate document bit more like to

706
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,850
have more information on it I'll see if

707
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,469
she's going to have address range there

708
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:48,189
but that will have other things for

709
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,360
example IP helpers other stuff we should

710
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:52,750
have been better then but there's two

711
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,669
separate document but same the service

712
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,070
if you got a record of service hang off

713
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,480
one switch and max which we're down how

714
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,790
much row service go so it's a whole

715
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,000
company gone then so you can monitor

716
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,320
eyes the network diagram and nothing

717
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,790
should you go to their local valve

718
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,189
someone either giving you permission or

719
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,360
ask me pressure you don't like to go to

720
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:16,300
environments they right why is that

721
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:17,740
there and you can't go you know you

722
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,389
should know you should I be a ticket

723
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,380
some are requesting it yeah especially

724
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,690
the account creation

725
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,000
you know why is that count their thumbs

726
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,950
up with ticket this ticket quite great

727
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,110
yeah and also if you've all of these

728
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,120
stuff of throwback make sure you go

729
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,399
documented you're going to do it it's

730
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,350
one you can hold it back but to when it

731
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,330
goes wrong which it will at some point

732
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,770
you turn around say oh I did this

733
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,290
because

734
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,389
is planned and this is what the so do I

735
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,070
was just doing stuff making out because

736
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,630
that's when mistakes happen that's what

737
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,370
I'm sure things don't get recorded and

738
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,350
then six months down the line you

739
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,030
Cartman that the who did it and why is

740
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,469
it they s you take it out and then that

741
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,200
thing stops working you can't work out

742
00:28:52,470 --> 00:29:00,930
what I think stop working and if it's

743
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,430
pocket and say login and that's the most

744
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,730
important thing to mention against every

745
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,410
sentence dousing people I would get

746
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,780
looks and don't read them or they don't

747
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,330
bother logging it's one of the other

748
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,240
bullies don't you go get without looks

749
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:18,840
has no sex happened how dear Saints

750
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,470
working I had you know same occurred you

751
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,429
simply don't now what should you lock

752
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,040
that's up to you sup to your environment

753
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,780
nineteen networks are the same and a

754
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,310
little say though or Windows boxes if

755
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,660
you are doing logging make sure you log

756
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:36,419
of NID 1102 my favorite then wins length

757
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,480
a lot of o2 is deletion of security

758
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:43,320
locks so if you delete the screw gods it

759
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,850
creates a long if you delete that log it

760
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,050
creates a lot tournament then so

761
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,429
basically you know so it's happening you

762
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,300
don't know what happened because your

763
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,160
locks been deleted

764
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,330
but you know there's been an event you

765
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,820
know someone's done something someone's

766
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,760
delivery date but and actually be the

767
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,399
indicator of something right here

768
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,740
especially if it was easy even a lot and

769
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,000
finally found services this why the

770
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,560
reason why we haven't wasn't networks

771
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,720
now virtual environments and cloud

772
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,760
environments virtual environments the

773
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,310
Nettleton server teams can now be

774
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,080
configuring the ESXi host which he had

775
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,000
virtual switch on there tends to be a

776
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,070
flat networks on those things but cloud

777
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,700
as well we found this fantastic virtual

778
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:23,040
environments fantastic scalable cheap

779
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:25,350
fantastic before this is a logging point

780
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,560
of view though is everything in green

781
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:31,590
your response working people very lumpy

782
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,720
feldspars if you look at infrastructure

783
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,830
as a service you'd make sure you're not

784
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,180
responsible for the network of the

785
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,100
storage other service or the

786
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,380
virtualization that means that you're

787
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,530
getting network locks now unless you're

788
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,260
the police wallstreet service or you've

789
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:48,600
got a contract he pre-arranged it to get

790
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,500
and from them you're not getting those

791
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,540
locks if you guys thought I've got some

792
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,340
traffic in my system come I saw there's

793
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,659
network logs place they're going to go

794
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,370
know GDP Oh perfect fiction and other

795
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,600
traffic might be on there which Wars

796
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,540
you're not going up

797
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,760
it's that simple so if you are going to

798
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,409
be slots of those roses just consider

799
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,810
what you're not guessing

800
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,890
especially for a low point of view and

801
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,659
it's a lot longer in the moment when you

802
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:21,030
probably off that bullet but you know it

803
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:21,030
is important and with that any questions

804
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,929
is on the cycling that never gives me

805
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,030
that one be there was a default VLAN

806
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,340
that all the vendors use and especially

807
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,360
their own hopping and stuff like that

808
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,649
never use that make sure you change the

809
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,260
feel NZ make it turns as well so if we

810
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:51,700
checked it so you come yeah

811
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:54,720
chain to the report situations we've got

812
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,830
so we existence up basically two

813
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,480
separate it's not gonna work for every

814
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,060
different situations it may have data

815
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,360
noises a completely sir boy voice

816
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,620
traffic is very different opción UDP

817
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:10,810
physique on I got connection based stuff

818
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:13,080
so yeah no to there what's this a use at

819
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,080
your own risk

820
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:25,300
come on this one individual to each of

821
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,190
your system you tell me your system

822
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,350
walks on freedom requirements but I

823
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,880
can't tell you oh you can do this you

824
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,260
must do this you must do this you must

825
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,730
imagine that what about how we manage

826
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,860
our y-you know if I work with what

827
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,450
positive Network email or mothers it's

828
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,919
really down to the environment there's

829
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,850
no such thing as two networks what works

830
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,860
for them what their symptoms that we've

831
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,469
got security policies around all there a

832
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,780
net flow analysis absolutely if you want

833
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:52,510
that it has to be requested has to be

834
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,600
signed off yeah by your screw TI because

835
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:57,100
if then their risk and more importantly

836
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,928
it must be reversed

837
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,639
once is completed so we're like leader

838
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:01,780
in a pen test you must put on a time

839
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,530
frame on it so we're going to use that

840
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,510
because there

841
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,030
what you do for it when show miracles

842
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,540
fine fantastic have what time you stop

843
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,149
doing it

844
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,620
that's I'm like yeah you've read these

845
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,840
scribbles wait have you punch anything

846
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,790
any call on your system you need to have

847
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,909
that time he agreed but more importantly

848
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:21,550
you need to take the blame from youth at

849
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,350
risk from you on to someone else make

850
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,510
sure you want adults sign it off because

851
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,620
ultimately it's been their thing but you

852
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,210
want to come down to you go there

853
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:32,639
because that's what they do

854
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,640
you can turn the email same abaga you

855
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:40,629
tighten to the way they use my favorite

856
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,890
Mac SEC Mac SEC is fantastic so Mac SEC

857
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,140
basically need to encrypt the traffic

858
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,850
through the host and the switch so you

859
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,560
got a four pull switch and all the hosts

860
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,300
of only max SEC why are you a tattoo or

861
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,810
Nexus or equipment like wait it's

862
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,580
already a E is the Sam there's an agent

863
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,260
on the machine and it encrypts the

864
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,870
traffic to the switchboard

865
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,390
so you're 24 different encrypted me now

866
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,830
if they go over Trump for every time

867
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,960
they go every thought they take they

868
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,179
take a different level of encryption

869
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,889
different clean every time so you can

870
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,780
play for the wrong different keys

871
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:12,010
because that links differently goes

872
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,720
effective on the key so I guess in

873
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:19,060
groups of the government where's the

874
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:22,418
hardware does that is it a separate from

875
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:25,480
the switch or is the CPU or PC and does

876
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:27,009
it know me someplace it's tight it's

877
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,870
really tiny because obviously onion just

878
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,370
goes from there to there but yeah is

879
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,899
know the heads up then again you don't

880
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,549
look at your traffic profile your

881
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:34,960
traffic thing and does it work for you

882
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,290
it could be a better way of doing it for

883
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,850
example use fiber fiber remove the

884
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:43,120
tempest issues there's no be able to get

885
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:45,129
that fun thing and but then you know

886
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,790
something still break into fiber so

887
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:51,009
secure we really put fancy tempest

888
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,989
stickers on your face by

889
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:55,480
insecurity can't really while minor

890
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:57,509
security action events in there yeah and

891
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,870
unfortunately there is no such thing as

892
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,550
one-size-fits-all

893
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:02,290
I could say the Cisco start if you look

894
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,870
like a people insurance you're looking

895
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,300
also motive you work in factory we work

896
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,799
in maritime you work in you know

897
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,540
whatever they're all very very different

898
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,910
ones you may still use that Active

899
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,589
Directory you know

900
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,480
2016 you may still easily lose 10

901
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:18,480
machine but the network is wearing

902
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,200
changes and nothing so you do see people

903
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,039
lose industry that you see mistakes

904
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,049
because they take some of the things

905
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,319
like learns in that industry and try

906
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:30,660
imply them to their new place of work

907
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:31,950
which probably not the best solution but

908
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:41,399
a new place to look that's what they've

909
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:45,569
always use that's what worked real peace

910
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:49,410
a PCI compliant PCI DSS is actually law

911
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:51,089
resist it's easier to have it there but

912
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,970
then that class would requires a PCI is

913
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:55,980
was it seven characters to be one number

914
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,509
I was like yeah

915
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,799
if you ever be a bare minimum of

916
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:03,750
standards that's not a good standard the

917
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:05,220
way you put your hand up a nose

918
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,609
scratching head but that's good enough

919
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,848
for me think of a question quite fine

920
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:15,420
networking where you stand on that about

921
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:18,779
here so it's coming it's there oh it

922
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,579
looks really a bad idea for security as

923
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:22,230
is uses again it depends on the purpose

924
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,150
where it's using that closer there's a

925
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,569
lot further software the SD wagons come

926
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,970
out now just way things going the

927
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:30,720
virtualized virtualization room there's

928
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,730
no escaping it

929
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,578
no mean the next range of Cisco

930
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,849
fantastic and it's all virtual roast is

931
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,079
it's great so it's not it's not going

932
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:42,900
away

933
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,490
now do you feel that it makes security

934
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,289
simpler complex

935
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,569
yeah it presents a different type of

936
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:51,150
challenges it removes them below one

937
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:53,759
stuff probably increases the layer to my

938
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,559
freeze that they not see a little blob

939
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,039
security coffin box screw which is also

940
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:58,470
that one

941
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,420
what's a blocky comes with that pictures

942
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,189
are see on Twitter with people post very

943
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:11,520
go cabinet and there's a toilet next day

944
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:12,869
yes yeah seriously yeah geez dude then

945
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:20,720
network that just works we just click

946
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:20,720
where it is and that happens a lot very

947
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:26,240
intensive okay well thank you very much

948
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,240
you
