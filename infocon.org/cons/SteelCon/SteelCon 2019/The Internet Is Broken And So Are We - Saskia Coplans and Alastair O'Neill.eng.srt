1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:10,910
oh yeah okay so this is this is artwork

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,440
which had a big abstract so basically

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,450
the idea of this talk is that

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,580
technologies come on a long way since we

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,220
first introduced the current model for

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,750
security and I think we can say that

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,130
security hasn't really kept up with

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,390
changes in development and so although

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,070
things are getting a little bit more

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,570
secure they're probably not getting

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,609
secured at the rate that we would want

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,440
them to and this is putting quite a lot

13
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,319
of strain on people who are in charge of

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,269
security so in this talk we're going to

15
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:40,249
discuss how we can use different bubbles

16
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:41,719
of security and then we're going to also

17
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,879
look at the impact that that's had on

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,389
our business because we started

19
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,870
employing

20
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:50,059
this change within security and it's

21
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,690
what that'll probably mental health to

22
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,849
us okay who are we

23
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,039
so I'm Alistair O'Neill some of you

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,719
might not leave March I'm head of

25
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,639
defensive security in that digital

26
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,350
interruption and I've got about ten

27
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:06,229
years experience in pentesting and I'm

28
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,490
really really into weirded for sex stuff

29
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:09,640
like forming verified crumbs

30
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,470
I'm not allowed to talk about this topic

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,870
so that's that's basically me under the

32
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,260
bridge of a bald cat there so yeah it's

33
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,660
a great I'm I'm sorry for plants and I'm

34
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,360
head of security risk and compliance and

35
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,250
I have about a decade's experience in

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,710
information governance and also

37
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,440
standards and the humans are really

38
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,679
weird in basic conspiracy theories that

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,620
I'm not allowed to talk about ever it

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,400
makes us look really weird if you want

41
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,830
to talk to me later in the pub I shall

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,070
tell you

43
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,750
okay so what's information governance

44
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,839
bit of an interesting one to start off

45
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,940
and security talk about and really

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,330
information governance is the driver for

47
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,500
security if you didn't have information

48
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,030
governance if you didn't have the need

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,860
to secure information you have nothing

50
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,030
to hack and so this is about the

51
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,550
management of information of an

52
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,050
organizing to a level and what we need

53
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,850
to do within information governance is

54
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,199
create and understand the balance of why

55
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,040
was

56
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,660
information so security is basically

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,950
saying we need X amount of people to

58
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,989
access this information and useless

59
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,260
information and we need to keep that

60
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:22,000
information secure so really if I have

61
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,829
my way the internet would be an

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,780
impenetrable glass box no one would be

63
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,910
able to get into it but then when I work

64
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,050
with people basement rightly say we

65
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,970
actually need to access this information

66
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,510
and do things with it so we have to find

67
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,060
this compromise and we use quite a lot

68
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,950
of stuff within IG frameworks for

69
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,420
endpoint use to handle data so needs of

70
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,768
protocols that we put in place which is

71
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,619
where we start moving over into the

72
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:46,840
security area and then we do a lot of

73
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,970
stuff around policy so this is about how

74
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,250
we guide the behaviors of how we deal

75
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,750
with information so I'm one of those

76
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,910
great people who spends a lot of time

77
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,680
writing policies I really enjoy policies

78
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,510
and I absolutely love standards I think

79
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,459
that being clear and concise is

80
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,078
incredibly important we don't tell

81
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,079
people what they need to do they don't

82
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:08,049
know how to do it so it's not always all

83
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,280
about hacking so let's look at this list

84
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,690
of why the information government

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,040
actually encompasses and some of you

86
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,930
might even see things you're familiar

87
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,230
with here right so we have rich men in

88
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,030
privacy

89
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,060
we have audit I mean that's that's

90
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,850
pretty much the standard security stuff

91
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,010
we have for example business

92
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,720
intelligence data science finance all of

93
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,190
this stuff is contained within

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,109
information governance and all of it

95
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,690
will be part of any kind of security

96
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:38,530
work really especially in any kind of

97
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,850
big organization and so that's why you

98
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,170
kind of we're talking about information

99
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,120
governance at the start we're going to

100
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,940
use it as a sort of a framework to

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,840
define what security should be for the

102
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,060
purposes of the talk

103
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,540
if you disagree you can talk to me later

104
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,310
but I'm right an information governance

105
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,040
isn't just about securing information

106
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,389
from an organizational level it's

107
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,459
actually about your own personal

108
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:03,020
information and how you govern your own

109
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,020
personal information so here

110
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,240
things like privacy and we've got stuff

111
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,270
like IT management we've got stuff that

112
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,350
you're gonna look up 500 example you

113
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,660
know you're gonna want to be able to

114
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,890
secure your financial details you don't

115
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,800
really want everyone to see in your bank

116
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,209
account so information governance is

117
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,340
something that is part of our everyday

118
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,570
lives and becoming more so because we

119
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,340
have so much information that we're

120
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,860
giving away and we need to understand

121
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,830
the risks involved in doing that and how

122
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,360
we secure ourselves personally so this

123
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,969
leads us on to what is information

124
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,520
security so information security is

125
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,810
we're gonna say a subset of information

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,109
government because it is it's about

127
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,870
trying to secure how data is actually

128
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,310
stored accessed and we're gonna talk

129
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,690
about those see I tried a little bit but

130
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,430
it provides organizations with

131
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,620
appropriate control over the data via

132
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,180
the CIA triad does everyone know what

133
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,060
the CI try it is because you don't

134
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,010
you'll find out soon exciting and it's

135
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,080
not just you know me creating a weird

136
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,150
box where I've stripped out glitzy and I

137
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,669
managed to cut down the kernel or it's a

138
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,989
form of a verified kernel or some kind

139
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,550
of an accessible vault because in the

140
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,680
real world people do need to access

141
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,170
their data people need to develop

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,930
solutions for things the business needs

143
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:18,320
to keep going so basically there needs

144
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:23,090
to be a sort of a balance struck between

145
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,920
risk and so again it's about this

146
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,419
balance it's about the balance that you

147
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,880
have which is to do with the risk

148
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,430
analysis and for information governance

149
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,320
we do number of things where we can make

150
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,450
a decision based on certain framework so

151
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,430
things like privacy impact assessment so

152
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,500
we can see the impact offer if something

153
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,150
the sleep from a privacy perspective we

154
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,620
can have data breach impact assessments

155
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,880
as well so we can look at the impact of

156
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,560
if there's a data breach and this isn't

157
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,780
just about fines and it's not just about

158
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,180
GDP our this is about the impact on

159
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,250
everyday lives so one of my favorite

160
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,220
examples is the Ashley Madison breach

161
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,600
that was a horrible personal data breach

162
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,610
and because it was about linking people

163
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,800
up to have affairs the impact of that

164
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,380
being released was devastating and four

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,350
people committed suicide directly linked

166
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:09,110
to that so we do need to make a clear

167
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,100
judgement about why why is it that we're

168
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,630
securing this data so

169
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,050
the CIA tried look at our blog is

170
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,320
holding it since it's a normal is the

171
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:24,440
model that we use a lot for sort of

172
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,980
quantifying the risk security is your

173
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,010
ancestor so anyone done cbss is I can

174
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:34,280
familiar with CBS s CBS s is a bit janky

175
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,140
but this is part of it and so it's

176
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,869
integrity confidentiality and

177
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,070
availability we're gonna end up I'm

178
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,330
looking for a definition of when are

179
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,390
like an origin of this and apparently

180
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,909
this is a pretty organic term integrity

181
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,800
came from the Bella Padula model in 1976

182
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,200
which is like a formal computing state

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:57,100
machine and confidentiality came from

184
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:59,330
the bp1 MST that won em in 1980 or and

185
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,460
they were when those were defined and

186
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,810
for some reason we managed to just sort

187
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,070
of check on availability is another

188
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,560
important thing that we want which is

189
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:10,099
good yeah this is sort of the core of

190
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,050
how we define sort of how secure thing

191
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,450
you should be and how that can be

192
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,800
impacted basically and there's a bug in

193
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,650
the middle because we have books and

194
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,110
everything I thought we were being very

195
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,640
similar in Tate

196
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,980
so what does this mean in practice Ally

197
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,479
so basically this means that information

198
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,340
security is a continuous process there's

199
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,140
no real end to it as long as your

200
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,849
business is growing and developing and

201
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,919
as long as you're storing data or

202
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,110
protocol data you're going to need to

203
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,810
keep doing this information security

204
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,880
it's an ongoing never-ending thing and

205
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,330
Aurora Voris eating its own tail kind of

206
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,520
deal and that means that the really the

207
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,659
need for security isn't constraint it

208
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,669
needs to constantly be going these

209
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,960
ucomfy developing it needs to be there

210
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,840
all the time but one of the problems

211
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,150
with a procession general as partners

212
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,219
talk is that we find the solution state

213
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,750
security are kind of constrained it's a

214
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,290
very sort of reactionary process and

215
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:08,780
yeah basically there's issues with it

216
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,390
and technology keeps moving and it keeps

217
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,099
changing so think about what we didn't

218
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,270
have five years ago that we have now

219
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,710
thank you

220
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,450
think of your phone you literally carry

221
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,260
a computer around with you as it used to

222
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,880
be a flip phone

223
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,050
I remember the matrix everyone thought

224
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,180
they were so cool because they had a

225
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,760
little blip phone

226
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,410
internet-of-things medical devices there

227
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,289
are all these things that we didn't have

228
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,409
before but the model for security isn't

229
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:35,200
changing technology is changing but

230
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,419
security isn't changing so not only are

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,400
we constrained we do a snapshot a pen

232
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,289
test is a snapshot in time we're

233
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,179
constraining how we respond but we're

234
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,310
also constraining the model and it's not

235
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,219
suspend us right I mean even IO sees

236
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,839
even other and like blue team kind of

237
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,000
stuff is very much a sort of a snapshot

238
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,410
of something at one point in time it's

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,670
all very static and it's all very

240
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,620
reactionary in date so this brings me to

241
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,000
talk a little bit about these like

242
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,410
constraint things how we kind of try and

243
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,050
get around them but we don't really do a

244
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,839
great sort of deal so I'm assuming

245
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,180
everyone here has read some kind of

246
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,940
massive threat report where they

247
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,640
attribute it to some government or

248
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,960
whatever else and that's kind of it

249
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,490
happens a lot of needs a second I feel

250
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,830
like it's kind of a cognitive sort of

251
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,310
trick we do to make ourselves feel like

252
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,660
we are actively protecting against these

253
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,339
groups whereas in reality each time

254
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,020
we're just finding them again as a

255
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:30,610
reaction and then pushing out IFC's

256
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,010
and this is what I call the Jeff

257
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,270
Goldblum theory where it turns out that

258
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,279
really it doesn't matter whether it was

259
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,020
China or Russia or whatever else it

260
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,970
could be Jeff Goldblum hacking your

261
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,529
alien mothership what really matters is

262
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,660
how your data was accessed and how

263
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,850
secure it was and how you can improve on

264
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,480
that and this is how you start to think

265
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,980
about things in a more continuous way

266
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,110
because in reality a constrained

267
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,640
solution to a continuous problem puts a

268
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,980
strain on the mechanisms and people

269
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,050
responsible for it and what it's really

270
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,470
doing is it's putting a strain on the

271
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,089
people who are responsible for it I'm

272
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,270
going to be like this universe so we get

273
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,270
ready

274
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,589
guys things still bad out okay it still

275
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,290
quitting

276
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,910
there we go and quitting needs to skill

277
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,020
shortages as well which is another thing

278
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,300
that we're going to try and brunch in

279
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,400
this because again a constrained

280
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,260
solution to a continuous problem is not

281
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,780
a good thing it puts people under a lot

282
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,390
of pressure and here the state starts

283
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,949
chasing its tail again because when you

284
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,150
have a skills shortage it means there's

285
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,890
not enough people and if there's not

286
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,240
enough people it means that individuals

287
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,069
are given mod to do which puts more

288
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,870
strain on the individuals and round and

289
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,610
round we go like the Magic Roundabout so

290
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,870
we really need to kind of understand the

291
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,180
skills shortage if we're going to

292
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,340
address it so these are some of the job

293
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,959
roles that we've taken out as Mark

294
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:55,940
Carney and Sabbath skills matrix and

295
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,290
they're doing some really awesome stuff

296
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,670
but this at the moment so if you're

297
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,400
interested to have a word with a bit

298
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,479
afterwards and it's it's it's kind of

299
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,000
roaming and all sorts of really

300
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,350
interesting ways and Ali and I will be

301
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,390
adding some stuff to it and I know that

302
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,920
Jays had other hideth as well and Sharon

303
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,230
has been very involved with this and

304
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,819
sherek very come out sorta the triple-t

305
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,380
asterixis beside them are the ones we've

306
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,410
added for the purpose of the top really

307
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,540
and because because really the matrix is

308
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,730
a life thing and a growing thing so

309
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,500
we've got penetration testers security

310
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,990
researchers writing and listen pious

311
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,240
members insulin sponsor nice intelligent

312
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,010
primal ingenuity architects or team

313
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,150
members privacy and things protection

314
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:37,880
specialist sweet and risk management and

315
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:41,000
that's a lot but we see security is a

316
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,240
singular thing but it's not it's an

317
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,800
ecosystem in its enormous how would you

318
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,330
actually look at the skills matrix they

319
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,990
start mucking the skills next to these

320
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,900
as well

321
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,430
and it gets to be very bigger and bigger

322
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,810
yet we still think of security as a

323
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,939
singular thing is singular

324
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,099
responsibility and we still think of it

325
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,960
very much as offensive we don't really

326
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:05,390
think of the defense side until someone

327
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:10,280
is planning on blue team and it's skills

328
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:12,140
focused but yeah so talking about the

329
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,490
skills matrix and the vast amount of

330
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,530
rules we have one of the other issues

331
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,290
that we've got here is that we have a

332
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,399
sort of a thing

333
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,740
like where the skills versus

334
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,470
competencies so I know a lot of people

335
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,279
who ask me how did you get into InfoSec

336
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,800
the answer is I just accidentally did

337
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,509
there are no formal pathways intersect

338
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,459
there are a few universities that are

339
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,500
doing intersects degrees of the moments

340
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,209
of advertise one but that's pretty much

341
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,029
the closest thing I think that there is

342
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:42,479
to a formal education for a second even

343
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:43,740
that is in very very early days and it's

344
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,750
kind of unusual because every other

345
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,880
skilled profession that deals with you

346
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,899
know risk or things that could be

347
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,660
damaging will have for example they they

348
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,190
have universal skills they have

349
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,660
scalability in what you're doing

350
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,360
there's assessments when they are

351
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,060
accessible they're regulated and they're

352
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,980
accountable and skills versus

353
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,489
competencies is important because a

354
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:14,730
skill is a singular learned attribute it

355
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:17,660
is easy it's anything that you learn in

356
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,779
order to accomplish another thing know a

357
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:25,680
competence

358
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:28,519
a competency is a measure it's a measure

359
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,410
of ability it's a measure of

360
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,110
characteristics it's a measure of skills

361
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,290
put together and that means that you can

362
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,970
successfully create a function which is

363
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,279
why when we have things like National

364
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,779
Occupational standards we have skills

365
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,420
and experience and we have knowledge and

366
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,889
understanding because your skills in a

367
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,750
vacuum don't mean anything if you don't

368
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:51,959
understand why you're doing it or what

369
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,199
you're doing it for so a competency is a

370
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:58,500
measure of the house as opposed to the

371
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,260
watt and this is what we absolutely do

372
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,680
not have in InfoSec is any coherent

373
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,939
tangible or joined-up standards and

374
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,589
really which we put that side in that

375
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,969
you sent me the other day where can you

376
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,700
explain me the one where it's a standard

377
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,200
and then

378
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,730
and we need to put all the solids

379
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,880
together and then we end up with 15 stop

380
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,700
oh my god yes he is an xkcd comic where

381
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,990
it's there's the there's 14 competing

382
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,760
standards why we just make a new

383
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,700
standard to unify them all and then the

384
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,040
result is there's 15 competing standards

385
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,360
and a lot of that's to do with the fact

386
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,890
that the bodies who were creating the

387
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,350
standards aren't joined up and it's not

388
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:36,130
on a national level we're basically a

389
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,780
very very infantile sector and by that I

390
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:45,400
mean we're young rather than we are

391
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:47,110
behaving in an infantile way I really

392
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,939
what we need is something coherent so

393
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,620
the idea behind something like a

394
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,390
national occupational standards is it

395
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,370
describes the competency that is needed

396
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,500
for the top role but it also explains

397
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,750
that competency to business so

398
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,370
businesses employers and educational

399
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,660
institutions can actually have an

400
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,210
agreement with the people in the

401
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,280
industry about what skills are needed to

402
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,140
build these competences and you don't

403
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,020
even have to have a singular competency

404
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,630
in an individual Ali and I are a joint C

405
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,460
so we are outside CSIS foot for our

406
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,230
company and half of one functional

407
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,080
person I am the other half of that

408
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,180
functional person we go into

409
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,370
organizations and we look at their

410
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,229
security posture we take everything

411
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,820
apart we threat model we do all of these

412
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,980
different things I come in crack the

413
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,480
wave pyrite and blow the standards and

414
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,010
policies and explain what they need to

415
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,870
do and then Ali goes in and actually

416
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,430
configures it yeah I sent a darkroom and

417
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,340
I type a function command senses into

418
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,359
whatever servers is report I have

419
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:48,370
firewalls you'd like that we'll call

420
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:49,960
them and we're trusted we're trusted as

421
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,800
individuals but what's our qualification

422
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,500
baseball bats

423
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,550
I provide the standards forever I've

424
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,070
been doing information governance

425
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,660
forever but where's my career pathway

426
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,460
that says that I am the right person to

427
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,770
do this why are you trusting me

428
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,270
people do trust me please I'm very good

429
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,490
at my job but why are you trusting me

430
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,980
how do I evidence this how has it been

431
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:13,570
assessed right and that's the thing that

432
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:16,060
we miss in the second thing so one of my

433
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,660
true well one of my mini bugbears I'll

434
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,689
probably show up in this is

435
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,130
in osep for example one of the

436
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,590
requirements one of the parts of the

437
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:28,070
test is basically has you write a buffer

438
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,390
overflow and don't let me pen testers

439
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,650
here but if there were I asked for a

440
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,660
show of hands about how many people

441
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,910
would use a buffer over like write their

442
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,410
own buffer overflow on a sort of you

443
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,060
know instead normal pen test jobs it's

444
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,610
really really love it's not the kind of

445
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,489
skill that we really require it's a sort

446
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,170
of technical curio that we just have in

447
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,670
there for no real reason it's not it's

448
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,140
you know it's not formally defined it

449
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,060
doesn't fit the role that we're doing in

450
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,310
a day to day business but someone at

451
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,130
some point has decided that this is what

452
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,969
we need to do because really we guided a

453
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:02,810
lot by B thoughts and influence of

454
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,730
others within InfoSec and let's face it

455
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,859
would you go to a doctor whose only

456
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,608
qualification was being mentored by some

457
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,030
random person they found on Twitter

458
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:13,520
[Music]

459
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,619
there's a lot of this I mean I'm not to

460
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,450
put major imbalance absolutely the best

461
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,060
we have right now it's a you know it's

462
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,680
better than having no one but we should

463
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,089
definitely be thinking about formalizing

464
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,550
the education structure and emphasize a

465
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:27,619
little bit better because it's not just

466
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,000
medicine like realistically think of

467
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,189
your lives which you can do to an

468
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,710
unqualified lawyer would you use an

469
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,320
unqualified accountant because the

470
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,990
impact is that being wrong is massive

471
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,110
and the impact of poor security is

472
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,270
massive has anyone seen their massive

473
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,600
enormous fine the VA just got hit with I

474
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:51,610
mean we're responsible for surprising

475
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,020
amount of that money partly now and

476
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,490
mentoring is useful it's useful at an

477
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,860
organizational level once somebody is

478
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,630
already within a business but actually

479
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,520
there's a number of issues with

480
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,110
mentoring in the wider world which is

481
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,720
white tends not to be used in other

482
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,260
professions in the way that we use it

483
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,720
mentees are inherently vulnerable right

484
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,120
so yeah I mean again there's no way to

485
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,560
really judge who your mentor is their

486
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,419
qualifications could just be someone

487
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,600
who's doing it you know for fun right

488
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,970
and I mean to be really serious about it

489
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,830
there are some concerns I have certainly

490
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,810
I mean if anyone wants to know you can

491
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,760
do captain

492
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,710
crunch and find out about like you know

493
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,300
really unpleasant things in this

494
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,380
industry to be honest with you people

495
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,040
are exposed to things that they

496
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,440
shouldn't be exposed to and in reality

497
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,409
just because my room into info SEC

498
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,030
worked for me and alleys route into my

499
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,840
psyche worked for him trying to

500
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,310
duplicate that is going to be impossible

501
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,649
because unless everybody in this room

502
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,510
wants to go and live in Azerbaijan work

503
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,010
undercover in a baby house right

504
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,040
standards to the government moved to

505
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,200
Kazakhstan then back to divine than

506
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,020
Germany work for a number of NGOs

507
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,530
different organizations the GMC you see

508
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,570
my point

509
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,280
everything is experiential for me I

510
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,500
can't pass that knowledge on that is

511
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,840
particularly personal to my experiences

512
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,550
so without the structure where we have

513
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,189
some kind of formalized way of saying

514
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,560
this is the expectation this is the

515
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,810
minimum we expect this is the core of

516
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,340
what we need you to do we're all going

517
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,620
to be flapping around trying to grab

518
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,360
bits off each other to create a jigsaw

519
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,070
puzzle that kind of looks a bit wonky no

520
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,409
and this is causing a huge amount of

521
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,210
frustration in the in the industry it's

522
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,560
causing frustration for employers

523
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,320
because they're trying to get these

524
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,090
unicorns that don't exist and it's

525
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,500
causing frustration for the people who

526
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,699
were trying to get into the industry

527
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,350
because they're all trying to be

528
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,180
unicorns because no one knows exactly

529
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:52,689
what it is that they need to do so yeah

530
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:54,520
this is actually the quote which we have

531
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,100
just because it's great it's a good

532
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,500
quote but yeah I mean essentially it

533
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,209
means that there's a lot of I guess the

534
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,800
industry is very loosely defined what we

535
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,230
do is very loosely defined and that

536
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,889
causes problems which we'll see in a

537
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,630
minute so here is someone what so you

538
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,970
guys might know that's right this is a

539
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,100
meme from the internet I did see a

540
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,350
favorite meme ever I've been alive

541
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,419
informed it's a it's good and again this

542
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,669
is as seen by so on and so forth

543
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,020
and

544
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,760
they're all seniors character through

545
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,560
film TV we're always stuff later

546
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,040
we even see ourselves and starts things

547
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:32,399
yeah and in a lot of ways this is kind

548
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,080
of how we do perceive ourselves I mean

549
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,840
certainly how our behaviors come across

550
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,600
as well yeah yeah and that's true I mean

551
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,620
like again security so well defined and

552
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,639
we have a lot of weird and sort of

553
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,959
contradictory advice a lot of the time

554
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,210
so for example we haven't gotten

555
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,800
password right our passwords right for

556
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,810
you know ever we've had so many

557
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,300
different kind of contrasting bits of

558
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,220
advice about passwords going back years

559
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,450
and years and years does anyone want to

560
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,310
know what the NIST standards for

561
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,510
passwords I don't even know the new

562
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:07,200
standard is for passwords not sure

563
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:09,629
thanks Steve all characters you favorite

564
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:16,260
member it you can spend on memorizing it

565
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:18,120
thank you even get it down writing it

566
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,320
down it's not actually bad advice for

567
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,600
those people as long as they leave it

568
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,100
somewhere else can get it button again

569
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,389
password managers better but this is all

570
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,310
this sort of to FA no to FA I hate to

571
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,660
effect yeah why would I want to get my

572
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,820
phone number to Facebook that's just

573
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,980
about it this I have to pay on buy my

574
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:39,480
iPhone and the fa is a message to my

575
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,730
iPhone I discovered when I hidden my

576
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,160
iPhone in the bottom of the bag yeah all

577
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,500
of this contradictory and even sometimes

578
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,900
maybe not great advice or not great way

579
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,530
not sometimes disclosure for example

580
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,330
could be handled badly - so VLC media

581
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,250
player was recently downloading updates

582
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,810
but they were checking whether they were

583
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,180
signs they weren't using friends for

584
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,310
their security people cost of a lot of

585
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,870
hassle and they didn't we didn't really

586
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,550
ingratiate ourselves as a community to

587
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,500
those guys we don't ingratiate ourselves

588
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,350
of the community through a lot people

589
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,690
and i'll you know i have been on sites

590
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,120
before where testers have been laughing

591
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,560
at def scared and spending the dumps was

592
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,060
a behind them that's fun

593
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,240
that wasn't make this up by ourselves at

594
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,730
all and we scream at vendors every time

595
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,500
i've been to get something wrong we just

596
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,790
absolutely lose a and start

597
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,050
screaming at them but what we don't do

598
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,520
is go in and say well this is what you

599
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,180
could have done this is how you could

600
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,740
have done this but

601
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,650
so we look like bullies yeah it makes us

602
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,140
look hostile and that itself makes it

603
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:41,440
difficult also to attract people into

604
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:44,380
the industry as well I think yeah

605
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,940
because people don't want to work in

606
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,810
industries that come across as hostile

607
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,550
and I'm hungry

608
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,250
they don't always feel welcome in

609
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,990
hostile and angry environments this

610
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,310
makes it difficult for us to be able to

611
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,340
connect with the people that we're

612
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:59,320
trying to protect and it really really

613
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,720
overshadows the really good work that we

614
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,090
do at work

615
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,730
thank God how does this impact consumer

616
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,560
so for the sake of just quickly

617
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,970
consumers here we mean who's put buying

618
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,409
our services right judged I mean again

619
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,270
I've been pen testing for 10 years I

620
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,610
have come on site where people are like

621
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,790
please don't hack us please don't ruin

622
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:24,520
our day please don't make us miserable

623
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:26,560
and you know they they maybe they find

624
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,900
it stressful down the pentester route

625
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,090
and again the attack and we are

626
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,590
inconsistent and it happens a lot right

627
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,899
you could get two different pen testing

628
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,070
firms and the reports will be different

629
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,180
people will highlight different issues

630
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,139
people will put things with different

631
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,790
risks ratings and so on and so forth it

632
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,250
it makes people feel attacked right and

633
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,470
they feel like it's inconsistent when we

634
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,940
prevent software going live because the

635
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,080
pen test has been scheduled for two

636
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,150
weeks before it's supposed to go live

637
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,659
and we stopped it because we found a

638
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:58,470
massive issue it's not good it's we're

639
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,970
the blockers in this scenario and

640
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:04,540
eventually I think people sort of stop

641
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:08,710
listening to us and software is released

642
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:12,250
and securely I mean I want to give an

643
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,780
example but there's just so many yeah I

644
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:18,610
mean there's not really a hint that's

645
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:21,460
right it's a climbing ooh yeah yeah yeah

646
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,229
so we were recently on site and a client

647
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,420
of ours didn't want to get a pen test

648
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,460
because he would have cost as much to

649
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,320
pen test this site as you would have

650
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,790
just for them with as much as they paid

651
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,860
to just get the site and everything set

652
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,750
up a small that was this like any cost

653
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,580
five grand okay well yeah yeah yeah

654
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,149
basically it was super expensive they

655
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,519
didn't want anything to do with it

656
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:42,168
we've got some really great situations

657
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,389
we have one client who just kept

658
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:46,189
emailing us and saying could you just

659
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:49,369
change the report give us a clean bill

660
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:51,079
of health who like no major

661
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:53,329
vulnerability fix the vulnerability and

662
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,948
while they were retest there are lots of

663
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:56,448
people you want to do some funding you

664
00:24:54,949 --> 00:25:01,159
just do it we promise we'll fix it like

665
00:24:56,449 --> 00:25:02,389
it's not an MOT it's an ability and you

666
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,589
need to fix the permeability and then

667
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:04,998
we'll come in and we'll do the retouch

668
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:06,319
so we just kept going around the circles

669
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,729
and this is just a fundamental

670
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,099
misunderstanding of what we do within

671
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:11,059
the security and the reality is they

672
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,109
probably didn't know how to fix the

673
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:15,049
permeability and didn't want to pay

674
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:16,759
someone else to do it but again this

675
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,079
means that there's pressure on us again

676
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,029
there's pressure on the businesses

677
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,549
pressure from the businesses and stress

678
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:24,769
leads to burnout burnout leads to

679
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:26,509
quitting and quitting is again looping

680
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:28,009
back to the skill shortage I mean I

681
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:29,719
don't know about you guys but probably

682
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:31,669
three times a week I think that's it I'm

683
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:33,559
done with computers I'm going to live in

684
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,629
a cave on the Faroe Islands I heard

685
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,549
goats for the rest of my life no more

686
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:39,708
technology because this is how we fail

687
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:41,239
yeah right very literally we start with

688
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:44,419
our cup of tea in a burning room it's

689
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:47,929
not like anybody needs a graphic

690
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:51,589
designer I did all of these I'm very

691
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:54,229
proud of them can you clap how can we do

692
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:58,069
things differently Ally well we are

693
00:25:54,229 --> 00:26:00,049
trying a few things differently but

694
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:01,879
especially we won't be seen as this guy

695
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:03,199
not Darth Vader we don't to be the guy

696
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:04,938
who wanders around with choking people

697
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:09,039
we want to be the guy in sage advice

698
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:09,039
guys but still gives

699
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,178
constantly productive even when he's

700
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,389
dead

701
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:18,519
and this is where kind of we can start

702
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:21,908
maybe taking major trip in a different

703
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,169
way right we can start passing on our

704
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:24,730
collective knowledge to people within

705
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:27,309
the businesses and that we're already

706
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,669
working with we can start sort of

707
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:32,230
empowering the teams that we work with

708
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:35,049
so for example we go to a lot of QA

709
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,690
testing conferences which are kind of

710
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:39,370
very different screaming dumb things but

711
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,110
we're kind of we try to make contact we

712
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,969
want to see what sort of tools are there

713
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:48,008
using and integrating into say you like

714
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:49,539
a CICE pipeline and yeah that's one of

715
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:53,470
the starting things that we're going to

716
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:57,279
talk about I take that food because

717
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,539
that's how popular security is and we've

718
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,879
got some about lovely testers in the

719
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:02,590
audience because we are starting to pull

720
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:03,820
the ABS in testers I think a bit more

721
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,158
comparing me in two very basic

722
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,779
competencies as well but we don't mix

723
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,289
around the conference's that we're not

724
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:13,119
spreading the knowledge and really this

725
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:14,980
is what it needs to be for us we need to

726
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,570
be sharing the knowledge not holding the

727
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,499
knowledge because for all that holding

728
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:23,230
the twelve-inch is like yeah nothing

729
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:25,629
activity changes and without sharing

730
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,009
that and we're basically stopping things

731
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:29,949
from progressing in a way that could be

732
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:31,990
secure and really really usable I was

733
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,480
asked at a panel that I was on with Amy

734
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,700
recently what am i excited about for the

735
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,710
future of technology and my response was

736
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:47,499
absolutely nothing I work in security

737
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:49,659
I'm terrified fair leads to anger and so

738
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,730
let's talk a little bit about left

739
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:53,169
shifting security in dev sec ops

740
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,110
is everyone here familiar with dev sec

741
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:57,730
up or left short expiry yes we have

742
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,799
hands all people that I know influence

743
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,240
and so basically this involves

744
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:04,029
integrating security into the

745
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,070
development pipeline and we can do this

746
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,960
kind of thing for almost anything that

747
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:11,379
you can have a self of pipeline for so

748
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,510
for networks or software or hardware

749
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,270
and if you can create a build pipeline

750
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,590
for it you can integrate security and

751
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,810
one of the great things about this is

752
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:22,379
the responsibility for security is

753
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:24,879
distributed across an entire team and

754
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,820
across a period of time as well so you

755
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,980
kind of get rid of technical debt right

756
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:32,020
so for example instead of developing

757
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,730
something for three years then you get a

758
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,230
pen tested and it turns out it has a

759
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,610
million fatal flaws from the very

760
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,080
beginning in the entire basic

761
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,580
architecture and now you've got to start

762
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,810
from scratch you don't have to do that

763
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,970
anymore because you'll have identified

764
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:47,139
all of those flaws way earlier on the

765
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:49,300
SPLC it creates a space for like

766
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:53,230
non-technical people to it's great value

767
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:55,120
as well so like purely say getting

768
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,700
getting a product owners involved in

769
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,989
working out maybe what could be

770
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,940
potentially issues at the start right

771
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,950
things like threat modeling having the

772
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,950
right security mind that this is that

773
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,790
these are stuff that people with a good

774
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:14,560
security mindset can add to the security

775
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,360
posture and diverse I got 10 trillion

776
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,310
and it's quite a new idea and it's

777
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,990
something that's growing but I think

778
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:22,000
even within that it's constrained in

779
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,010
itself because it tends to talk about

780
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,050
developers and how developers do things

781
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,790
more securely the inside teams can be

782
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,560
bought into this and one of the

783
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,790
organizations that we worked for this

784
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,290
whole fight with them for about eight

785
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:35,020
months

786
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:36,430
at least about but I can see that I left

787
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,379
with them was bringing in a dev site

788
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:40,150
hops environment but they've done it

789
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,640
with their can you a testers which makes

790
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,700
perfect sense because you can split QA

791
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,260
testers off into total two fairly broad

792
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,260
groups which is the pretty technical

793
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,570
ones and the less technical ones and the

794
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,430
technical QA testers can pick up a lot

795
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,470
of the stuff that we do a security test

796
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,060
is very very easily and when they do it

797
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,650
means we don't have to do it because

798
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,649
that's based it who wants to take

799
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:04,090
through the OWASP top 10 I mean it not

800
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,500
the least sometimes but yeah yeah

801
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,840
instead of being seen as dark Vador

802
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,749
sometimes I'd like to be Yoda I'd like

803
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,478
to have my own planet

804
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:15,429
and talking of VA Wells top ten if we

805
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:17,469
create the right tools we wouldn't have

806
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:19,690
to well well that's not strictly true

807
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:22,179
we'd still incentives but and yeah so I

808
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:25,209
mean one of the things that I found

809
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:27,549
since I various yeah with like QA

810
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:29,379
testers and other people is that our

811
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:32,769
tools as a security industry are really

812
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:34,928
really obtuse like I was using the

813
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,820
Metasploit a few days ago and I realized

814
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:38,109
I never use a tool with this interface

815
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,700
before in my life

816
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:44,829
it's really sort of weirdly put together

817
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,119
it's like the the set our hosts and

818
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:47,979
stuff is almost like your sporting

819
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,789
environment variables and Linux it's

820
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:53,559
it's peculiar and it's not intuitive and

821
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:56,349
when I've used QA testing tools which I

822
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,690
have been using or leasing and they are

823
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:59,769
really really intuitive there's this you

824
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,570
don't need to put a lot of thought into

825
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:04,179
how it runs it just runs in the

826
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,158
background and they also tend to

827
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:09,779
integrate really nicely into the CI CD

828
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,899
pipeline so they can give you a Contiki

829
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:15,219
continuous feedback all of the time and

830
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,689
yeah yeah at the moment we're actually

831
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:19,089
trying to develop a tool that's a

832
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,219
vulnerability scanner for Android apps

833
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:23,019
that is basically supposed to

834
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:25,690
integrating with Jenkins and other tools

835
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,979
in the CI CD pipeline and the idea is

836
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,869
that we're taking all of our collective

837
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:31,539
security knowledge and letting you know

838
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:33,009
QA testers use it instead and yeah I

839
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:35,679
mean instead of teaching people how to

840
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:36,849
hack instead of kind of coming up which

841
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,669
is the way that we're doing it with the

842
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:40,839
mentorship and the osep which and all

843
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:42,789
that kind of stuff which hasn't really

844
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:45,009
managed to fill the skill shortage maybe

845
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:47,259
we should think about giving people ways

846
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:48,700
to build securely so that we take again

847
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:51,070
that technical debt and that pressure

848
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,529
off of us and in this context as well

849
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,769
tools when we're not just talking about

850
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:58,629
like software maybe also things like

851
00:31:55,769 --> 00:32:00,159
frameworks for for you know how secure

852
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:01,689
you should be built from the start at

853
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,789
all really at all could be anything in

854
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,379
this context that helps you or enables

855
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,149
you to do something so it could be a

856
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:08,708
framework it could be a policy it could

857
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:10,779
be something like threat modeling it

858
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:13,419
could even be training training people

859
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:16,690
with the right mindset and one of the

860
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:18,309
things it's awesome about QA testing

861
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,349
tools as the names they're absolutely

862
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:21,700
obsessed with vegetables they've also

863
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:23,290
got really cool names like tor

864
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,980
I mean that's something off so they have

865
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:28,629
selenium but every time they go out

866
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:33,880
which really irritates people when I'm

867
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:35,080
trailing but Rex is the tool that we're

868
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,730
developing because I really like

869
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,000
dinosaurs so it seemed like a good name

870
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,040
at the time and it's in testing stage at

871
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,470
the moment so if anybody is developing

872
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,750
Android applications and wants to test

873
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:52,390
it get in touch with us and we'll get

874
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:54,250
you a sign in so this is where we go

875
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:58,390
back to the skills matrix the skills

876
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:00,520
matrix is focusing very very much on our

877
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,260
internal skills in our internal industry

878
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,389
and but actually there are a lot of

879
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,210
skills that are quite relevant to what

880
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,830
we do that already exist and a lot of

881
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,640
technical and non-technical people that

882
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:15,250
are already and within the ecosystem of

883
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,710
putting together software and I need to

884
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,140
think about security and if we start

885
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,760
empowering them with the tools but they

886
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,760
need to think more securely and operate

887
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,550
more securely and we can start spreading

888
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,379
the responsibility for security so that

889
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,480
it's not all sitting on us of security

890
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,200
professionals this doesn't do as out of

891
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,060
a job

892
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,820
but it makes our job more targeted and

893
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,010
it makes our job more useful at the end

894
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,629
but the main thing that it does is it

895
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,350
takes that preventers responsibility

896
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:46,930
away one of the things about doing a

897
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,030
panel test at the end of development is

898
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,190
it's like a game of Jenga have you ever

899
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:54,280
tried to put the Jenga rod back into the

900
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,750
pile without knocking it over so we kind

901
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,100
of stuff it with stuff and call it

902
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,990
patching and hope for the best

903
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,520
the product over there is very one of

904
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:05,380
our patches because people like to be

905
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:07,930
changes so basically some of the things

906
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,690
that we can put in place this is just a

907
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,800
snapshot it's an idea and there are all

908
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,139
sorts of different things within

909
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,570
security but product owners can create

910
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:19,418
the right requirements they can do

911
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:21,160
initial security considerations defining

912
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:24,580
the risk of a response so things like

913
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,230
and reach and implications is something

914
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,659
that they can define and the

915
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,940
implications that data protection is

916
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,529
something that they can define then we

917
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,300
have the developers creating secure

918
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,429
builds of

919
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,940
technology interpreting vulnerabilities

920
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:40,290
and solutions learning secure account

921
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,810
doing things in Sprint's and then

922
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,190
testing after each sprint means that you

923
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,630
don't have to necessarily have an

924
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,600
enormous talent test that takes two

925
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,890
weeks at the end which is vitally

926
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,589
important for you to go live only to

927
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,418
find that it's full of holes and Jade

928
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,010
did the test once which was horrifying

929
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,690
where he was able to steal the money out

930
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,880
of every single bank account from an

931
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,290
application because the variability was

932
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,820
so embedded in the code it didn't take

933
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,290
it out they couldn't sell the

934
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,200
application they would have to rebuild

935
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:11,190
the application then we have the testers

936
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,500
we do fantastic Elton's influence

937
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,150
initial due diligence requirements

938
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,650
technology vulnerabilities these are

939
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:27,630
people who are already poking around

940
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:29,460
with this tech probabilities our basic

941
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:31,710
features bugs and ant software testers

942
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,080
are already looking for bugs we have

943
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,690
some more bugs but not of the software

944
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,640
kind we have design for example again

945
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,790
they can help in building tools with

946
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,620
better UI scalability usability and like

947
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,180
one of my bug bears again when software

948
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,960
tools and security tools not having

949
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:51,450
great UI as anyone here used PGP I don't

950
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,980
think anyone gasps yes excellent what

951
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:57,509
any of you say it's a usability is good

952
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,740
yes incredibly it's an incredibly

953
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,840
essential tool I mean we don't really

954
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,629
have anything else pretty good for email

955
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,820
a prefix I pressed mine but people don't

956
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,800
want to use PGP even the creator of PGP

957
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,900
doesn't use fatigue review for 50

958
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,090
minutes that's that's what we've got a

959
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,670
problem and we also the deployment

960
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,650
people so for example these guys can be

961
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,360
involved in configuring the pipeline

962
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,800
correctly they can be involved in

963
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,960
security considerations when it comes to

964
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,340
the pipeline when we do the testing and

965
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,600
so on forth but when we talk about this

966
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,210
and they can also be involved in like to

967
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,410
fight there do I need you diligence even

968
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,850
for like deploying boxes you know

969
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,670
there's a lot of stuff that we do that

970
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:34,920
could be done by anyone really involved

971
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:42,120
in the process of setting up the server

972
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:43,650
and we also have security which is us so

973
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,660
we can be involved in stuff like threat

974
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,660
modeling we can be involved like really

975
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,509
interesting

976
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,190
like I think maybe we could even do

977
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,590
buffer overflows on our day-to-day

978
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,940
business now and we can also help verify

979
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,400
you know issues that have been found by

980
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:59,230
other people during the testing process

981
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,960
and just generally giving advice and

982
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,750
being Yoda sitting down happily doing

983
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,400
our stuff we have thing and again

984
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,990
insecurity in this context is security

985
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,100
mindset so it could be a technical

986
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,479
person it could be a non-technical

987
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,670
person it might be that you have a

988
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,650
privacy lawyer in your organization you

989
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,210
have to be using that privacy lawyer to

990
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,040
help you understand why you need to be

991
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,550
secure or are you just using them to mop

992
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,080
up the pieces after you breach there are

993
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:26,190
people like me everywhere I'm just

994
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,690
naturally incredibly suspicion

995
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,070
because nobody I assume everything is

996
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,400
going to be the worst case scenario this

997
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,600
is like I just know that everything is

998
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,430
the worst case scenarios I've tested

999
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,140
things for so many times literally every

1000
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,759
time I look at anything the first thing

1001
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,609
I'm looking at is a location marker

1002
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,190
because I was abducted as a child like

1003
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:47,020
the parental thing but that's actually a

1004
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,060
reality so it makes you very suspicious

1005
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,130
you think in a certain way so if you

1006
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,049
think of worst case scenario then you

1007
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,330
can start to say what's the threat and

1008
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,770
that's a basically trap modeling yeah

1009
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,390
then you can go look on Wikipedia and

1010
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,220
get some things that sort of give you an

1011
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,170
acronym come out with stride but it's

1012
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,029
basically flat modeling it's thinking

1013
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,190
about what the facts in the data are so

1014
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:09,490
again we need to drive from why are we

1015
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:13,210
protecting your data so to loop back to

1016
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:16,629
our original fear and doubt no that's

1017
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:19,840
problem and loop back to like stress and

1018
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:22,270
burnout so if the GUI is embedded when

1019
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,550
the attachments start it means that our

1020
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,320
from input is more interesting is more

1021
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:29,500
welcomed and it's generally more fun for

1022
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,880
us and there's nothing fun about doing a

1023
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,620
two-week test on something that no one

1024
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,810
cares about anymore Horace talked about

1025
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,310
in terms of security no one enjoys it I

1026
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,590
don't enjoy it they don't enjoy it the

1027
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,880
whole process is your pain and it means

1028
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,680
our tests can be performed in smaller

1029
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,760
bursts as well so we can sort of fit it

1030
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,770
around the SPLC

1031
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,800
I'm there therefore development

1032
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,450
processes and it can be done when it's

1033
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,900
required by the deaths as well instead

1034
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:54,720
of simply as a sort of rubber stamp for

1035
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,300
PCI DSS or something else that

1036
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,040
forcing them to get that stuff they can

1037
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,410
be performed in shorter time scales

1038
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,279
which we're doing more tests and this

1039
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:07,740
means that we can also hopefully avoid

1040
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,010
the my least favorite part of the job

1041
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,810
which is the PDF report so we started

1042
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,550
doing things like raising issues in JIRA

1043
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,349
for example which I'm really enjoying

1044
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:28,410
because I don't need to write it in my

1045
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:30,599
office when he was trying to read this

1046
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:35,190
presentation Versa lariats all the folks

1047
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:37,470
expect it yeah we try and make it make

1048
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,590
more collaborative and and again you

1049
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:42,419
know the PDF report is it's a not really

1050
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,010
a welcome thing I've gone on so many

1051
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,830
sites where they've like can you copy

1052
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,990
all of these issues into a CSV because

1053
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,460
that's what we'd be doing anyway so you

1054
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,618
know just behind you for our stuff and

1055
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,730
of course what why don't we just you

1056
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,470
know let us know why do we do this from

1057
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,760
the start why does everyone get a PDF

1058
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:59,069
report it doesn't make sense no need

1059
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,099
arises and again this is something that

1060
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:03,869
we're already doing Jamila was shocked

1061
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,180
when he heard that I'd already set up a

1062
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:09,660
0 vm just to start doing this kind of

1063
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,848
thing and then so I'm certainly enjoying

1064
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,368
it a bit more than a the one hour

1065
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:18,270
are the nine hours of reporting that I

1066
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:19,920
do for like most us sir has Ali says

1067
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:24,000
this is something that digital

1068
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:29,960
interruption is already doing why did we

1069
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:33,630
decide to do this we were knackered

1070
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:36,450
we were absolutely knackered after 10

1071
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:39,619
years of pen testing I have been on site

1072
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:43,319
a lot I have traveled a lot on weekends

1073
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:45,119
and it's a really stressful job when

1074
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:49,560
you're living on site basically and

1075
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,690
there's now six people in DI good call

1076
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,279
three of us were basically living on

1077
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,650
site we have a developer who wasn't

1078
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,540
living on site actually brought me as

1079
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:03,750
well for a button yeah and so you when

1080
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,369
you live in a Travelodge in Slough you

1081
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,720
don't have a home life you don't have a

1082
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:10,900
routine your relationships suffer

1083
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,399
and your health suffers that's why

1084
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:17,260
people have what we call the pen test

1085
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,619
belly jana is all about that'll burn

1086
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:23,920
your diet suffers because having lived

1087
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:27,609
in the hilton for nine months and you've

1088
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,430
eaten the menu 92 times over it all gets

1089
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:32,788
slightly depressing there's a gym there

1090
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,169
but you know just watch the telly and

1091
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:37,150
you can't get sick because you can't go

1092
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,440
to the doctor because you doctors linkle

1093
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,380
and you're not local anymore

1094
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,880
and we also find that as consultants we

1095
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,740
have to be responsive so if a job comes

1096
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,490
in you have to do it so someone has to

1097
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,959
take the hit so back to flour you go and

1098
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,598
shadow link can be haphazard within a

1099
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,980
lot of consultancies so I think even

1100
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,530
with the situation where are the

1101
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,789
scheduling working certain exercises and

1102
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,020
I have people from London coming up to

1103
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:00,640
Manchester and people from Manchester

1104
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:04,780
going down to London make me sense

1105
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:07,170
oh and all of this put something massive

1106
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,849
strain on people and it makes people

1107
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,440
tired and it makes people burn out and

1108
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:13,990
it's not good for mental health it's not

1109
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,730
good for mental well-being and it's not

1110
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,169
good for people to be able to have a

1111
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:20,910
happy and conducive life or a family

1112
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,890
[Music]

1113
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:28,420
because we are resources but we're also

1114
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:29,950
people and our partners are people so

1115
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,720
our partners are the ones that are left

1116
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,480
at home with the dogs and the kids and

1117
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,919
all of the responsibilities and they're

1118
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,599
the ones that are taking up all of this

1119
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,420
emotion or housework because we're

1120
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,339
absent because when we're not on site

1121
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,460
we're thinking about security all the

1122
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:47,890
time which is why you can start it

1123
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,910
beyond the abstract who stays up all

1124
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,819
night thinking about the next

1125
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,589
vulnerability we all do and it's because

1126
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,150
there is so much responsibility part on

1127
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:57,970
it's for security that it becomes

1128
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:01,210
absolutely encompassing it sucks

1129
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,709
everything out of us absolutely so when

1130
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,910
we set up digital interruption we

1131
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,539
decided we were going to do things

1132
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,250
differently

1133
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:08,710
we were very evangelical about dev

1134
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,900
suck-ups because we're sanctimonious we

1135
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:14,520
won't be do contest and then we nearly

1136
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,520
run out of money so now we pen test

1137
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,730
but what we can do is we can use the

1138
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,640
monthly money from the let me confess

1139
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,990
that no one wants to do we can use that

1140
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,540
to offset the work that we do enjoy

1141
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,310
doing so we have a massively discounted

1142
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,290
rate for tax for good so if

1143
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,370
organizations need to develop secure

1144
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,920
tech because they're doing something

1145
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:36,750
awesome like creating software but

1146
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,370
because pieces of harassment bullying

1147
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,650
sexual assault all the way up to vape

1148
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,779
they really need to be secure and I

1149
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,720
really want that software to exist so I

1150
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,440
give them a massive discount rate and

1151
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,240
literally everyone within our

1152
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,410
organization at some point has helped

1153
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,120
with the piece of work that we're doing

1154
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,279
for this software to make it as robust

1155
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,630
and scalable as possible we do other

1156
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,610
pieces of work that center around

1157
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,380
children and stuff around medical stuff

1158
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:00,500
and we absolutely crash the write down

1159
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,270
for it but we make them do tub setups

1160
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,040
it's not a pen test at the end we're not

1161
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,780
interested in sticking stuff back in the

1162
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:12,480
Jenga tower we want them to understand

1163
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:14,670
security we've also got some pledges

1164
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,770
that we decided on well this is this is

1165
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,440
Jamal Safian is more than me but I'm

1166
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,780
gonna take some credit for well

1167
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,310
obviously because we're a flat structure

1168
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:28,440
so like your majesty when we decide that

1169
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:31,320
the organization we went for unlimited

1170
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,450
personal days no one in our organization

1171
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,040
has to call in sick nothing okay why you

1172
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,279
can't come in if you're below but I hope

1173
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,470
you had a lovely night if you're having

1174
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,620
a really hard time you can tell me and I

1175
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,609
will listen if you have surgery and you

1176
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,200
don't want to tell me what that is

1177
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,700
that's fine because you know what if

1178
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,350
I've got your sick note I have to deal

1179
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,850
with that information and that puts me

1180
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,080
in a legal position so I can't really be

1181
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,009
bothered with the more interesting

1182
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,569
things to do with my time

1183
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,150
so it's fine it's also that effect so we

1184
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,680
also got no port on site which is good

1185
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,660
because basically it means we don't go

1186
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,180
on site that much if there's a test

1187
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,890
we're doing we will try very hard and

1188
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,020
usually succeed and finding a way to do

1189
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:10,109
it remotely or we do at least limit the

1190
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,259
amount of like on site going on telstra

1191
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,260
halls

1192
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:23,150
booby traps are welcome yes we work with

1193
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,859
realistic utility and so a lot of

1194
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,960
organizations that we've all worked with

1195
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:29,210
in the past have said that they're 75%

1196
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,270
util and the rest is abdomen and and

1197
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:34,309
research time we are literally 75% you

1198
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:35,630
tilt it got it spread out across the

1199
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:37,250
year because we're small and we do have

1200
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,530
to be responsive so sometimes we'll have

1201
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,539
a couple of months where we absolutely

1202
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:43,819
back to back and then we'll felt about

1203
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:45,559
for a bit when were quiet and give

1204
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:46,880
everybody a nice little rest we shut the

1205
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:49,970
office down for two weeks at Christmas

1206
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,010
in our first year and Rob had never had

1207
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:54,160
Christmas off and he was suicided he

1208
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:57,170
tweeted about it

1209
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,799
happy people we have flexible working

1210
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:02,750
yeah so I for example work three weeks

1211
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,640
on when we got it's amazing I have a

1212
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:08,390
week where I can just sit around at home

1213
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:12,049
doing nothing I'm so happy and it's yeah

1214
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:13,609
it's great we basically well like Rob

1215
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:14,809
for example were completely remote me he

1216
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:18,109
almost never comes into the office

1217
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:20,930
yeah he really likes the MBA so we kind

1218
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:22,848
of do kind of like daylight reversal or

1219
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,368
different hours if he wants to some

1220
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:27,770
point I put that is fast up or observing

1221
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:29,930
a Ramadan or the MBA they can move if

1222
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:32,059
they want a little bit of a marketing

1223
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:33,859
type line there but flexible needs to be

1224
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:36,460
flexible you know people do have lives

1225
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:39,259
again with people we're not resources

1226
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:42,890
are most importantly we have no bosses

1227
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,930
because no one listens to us anyway but

1228
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,328
a flat structure is really important for

1229
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,940
people's well-being and it's a case of

1230
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:53,049
being able to say no if you don't have a

1231
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,049
situation where you're feeling

1232
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,190
if you don't have buses you can't be

1233
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,450
forced to do things that you don't want

1234
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,220
to do which is bad for your mental

1235
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:06,330
health I just have to resort to

1236
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,980
manipulation and they you've got this is

1237
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:11,580
hard for us as brilliant because we've

1238
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:14,160
got office we do gardening and we go and

1239
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,049
see our families and we do skateboarding

1240
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,359
today and I going to be learning Russian

1241
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,370
because we can actually commit to go

1242
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,260
into a class every week on a Tuesday

1243
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:25,890
because we can move our work around this

1244
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,510
and Rock plays basketball yeah the name

1245
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,129
is basketball all the time I don't know

1246
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:38,130
what YouTube I don't want to know what

1247
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:39,870
you did you can do too so those points I

1248
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:43,020
just might not be realistic for everyone

1249
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:46,589
but we do I guess it's just you know you

1250
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:50,700
could potentially look like let's start

1251
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:52,590
with like managerial stuff so don't

1252
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,830
promote bad managers is a bit bit I grow

1253
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:57,360
but like anything your managers are

1254
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,520
really people ppad people because I

1255
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,010
worked in some places where managers

1256
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,330
have been stupendously technical and

1257
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,690
don't want to deal with the actual like

1258
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:08,160
management side of things and I guess

1259
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,040
that kind of ties into enforcing good

1260
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,020
policies as well so again you want you

1261
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,500
know a business that has policies that

1262
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,610
look out for the people that work there

1263
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,140
you want to ask your staff you want to

1264
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,550
get feedback from your staff about these

1265
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,879
things and about your manager and about

1266
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:25,950
everything else trust doctors is it's a

1267
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:30,900
really important one for me I have ADHD

1268
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:32,609
I make no secret of my ADHD and it does

1269
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,750
all sorts of interesting things to my

1270
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,940
brain but one of the things I

1271
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,730
particularly have problems with is noise

1272
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,950
I really noise sensitive and I'm the

1273
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:42,930
ADHD kind of person that can't put on

1274
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,339
headphones and listen to music if I'm

1275
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:48,649
listening to music I can't think of

1276
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:51,510
anything else nothing gets done

1277
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,580
ping-pong really irritates me I can't

1278
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,210
stand drains nerf guns are the worst

1279
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,220
thing in the world

1280
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:59,829
and I can just hear the tapping of Snuka

1281
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,779
so when I'm in an organization that says

1282
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:03,190
we have all these really cool stuff that

1283
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,869
might be great but for me it's really

1284
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,190
exclusionary and I think for a lot of

1285
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:07,809
people on the spectrum and stuff like

1286
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,119
that can be really really illusionary

1287
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:12,069
I'm really what we want to foster it

1288
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:14,920
digital interruption is an environment

1289
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:16,690
where everybody is welcome and part of

1290
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,910
that mental health is understanding that

1291
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:21,880
mental health is also about neurotypical

1292
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:24,040
and non very typical and we don't know

1293
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,430
what Ali is but he has a specific way of

1294
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,230
dealing with things so we basically just

1295
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:31,480
trust our staff we give them the

1296
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,940
autonomy to be able to make their own

1297
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,369
decisions

1298
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,839
finally don't buy my practices yeah so

1299
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:40,150
this is more for like clients as well

1300
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,529
what I mean no ask your penetration

1301
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,030
tester how he's doing how far he's

1302
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:44,770
traveled if he's been in place a

1303
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:46,480
proportionate yeah yeah if you can

1304
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:47,980
request someone from like nearby or

1305
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,540
locally and save someone you know three

1306
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,839
hours travel on a Sunday please try and

1307
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,250
do that something happens the worst oh

1308
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:55,540
my god I know it's the worst and when

1309
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,520
people say you don't have to do Sunday

1310
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,109
trouble we've got a policy on it don't

1311
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:05,430
then say you have to get up at half past

1312
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:05,430
three in the morning on Monday yeah yeah

1313
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:10,869
yeah do things like look at class stop

1314
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,430
see what these stuff are actually saying

1315
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:13,299
so when you're looking at different

1316
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,509
vendors when you're looking at different

1317
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:19,359
companies and if you're paying for

1318
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:21,010
companies to produce things and you're

1319
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,020
then consuming that and you're also

1320
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,579
paying for them to abuse their stuff if

1321
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,500
that's what their business culture is

1322
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:28,420
like so these are things that we as a

1323
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,040
community can do we can say enough is

1324
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,540
enough we can say we don't want to do

1325
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,609
this anymore we can say that we are

1326
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,799
tired we can say that we are knackered

1327
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:37,450
and we don't have to set up our own

1328
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,730
company in order to have that autonomy

1329
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:42,220
there are so few of us and we are in

1330
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,589
such demand that we can actually start

1331
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,189
to say we don't want to do it like this

1332
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:46,690
anymore

1333
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:48,339
and we can start to push that change

1334
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,220
ourselves it's just about having the

1335
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:52,500
courage to do so

1336
00:50:50,220 --> 00:51:02,069
thank you for coming to our turn rent

1337
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:03,900
thank you hon any questions yes everyone

1338
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,400
is questions oh god I don't know how we

1339
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,410
can we can deliver this up because

1340
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,610
people are how this works well you guys

1341
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:13,379
you have to choose who you want to pay

1342
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:15,120
the question so I do mostly saying isn't

1343
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,840
Christ already doing some type of work

1344
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,400
in terms of actually making this into an

1345
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,980
industry I think you're right yeah I

1346
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,000
crusts are definitely doing a make

1347
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,520
making head wounds in there I think

1348
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,770
we're fully there yet but I agree the

1349
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:32,280
questions don't really great details but

1350
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:35,370
yeah Chris isn't unified we've still got

1351
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,140
stuff like the CH and CPM stuff and the

1352
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:40,500
Chris actually has integrated other CP

1353
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,790
into the CIT now but yes not every quest

1354
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:46,430
is doing good stuff but it's optional

1355
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:48,420
isn't it yes so that's the thing and

1356
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:50,370
something isn't a standard unless

1357
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,350
everyone is doing it and that's the

1358
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:55,230
problem so someone who's been putting

1359
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:56,880
standards together forever and that is

1360
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,410
the reason that we have an absolute core

1361
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,620
minimum standards for things like child

1362
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:03,330
care and medicine because the impact of

1363
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,210
not doing that is the bride's mistake

1364
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:07,500
and that's something that we have to

1365
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,030
take into consideration through security

1366
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,230
as well yeah you didn't get the software

1367
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,930
right for a plane and it pulls out the

1368
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,760
sky what's the impact of that and and

1369
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:16,529
through all that Quest is doing great

1370
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,530
work it's kind of doing it on its own

1371
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:21,120
and it's also quite expensive so if you

1372
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:23,130
take something like national bacon or

1373
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,810
standard that's paid for by the

1374
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,890
government it's universal everyone has

1375
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,299
to have it and you simply cannot

1376
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,940
practice unless you meet that standard

1377
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,100
and it's regulated it is something that

1378
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,450
you haven't imitating so I think that's

1379
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,250
the problem that we have at the moment

1380
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:38,250
is security is just so incredibly

1381
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:40,430
expensive in every way and for all that

1382
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:42,480
the frameworks for Cresta brilliant it's

1383
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,640
constantly having to be accredit it's

1384
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,500
constantly having to reset exams how

1385
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,960
many people did we have that we've known

1386
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,090
in our in our impersonal community the

1387
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,080
who keep trying to resit the crest exams

1388
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,550
and then they just run out of time

1389
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,470
because they get polling site yeah I

1390
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:58,900
mean and

1391
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:08,348
yeah Indian short Christmas good but

1392
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:11,410
yeah like formal education that you got

1393
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:13,780
to push up who caught you oh so yeah

1394
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:16,359
that is one thing that is worth talking

1395
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:20,109
about then again it comes down to cost I

1396
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:21,400
would rather it all be free somehow and

1397
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:22,750
I think to be honest with you like

1398
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,580
security should probably be something

1399
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,020
you should be teaching from like in in

1400
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,848
primary school why are saying this or

1401
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:31,390
whatever we have computers in school

1402
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:35,230
here because it's a really poor and

1403
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:37,299
useful school that have like justjust

1404
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:38,710
even knowing that you shouldn't put your

1405
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,660
bank details under sometimes it's not

1406
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:42,490
using HTTPS so a lot of people don't

1407
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,379
know right but also pushing it behind

1408
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:46,029
education is interesting going but this

1409
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,710
is not missing it but I definitely have

1410
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:51,220
National Occupational standards it's

1411
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:53,200
having a clear and concise and uniformed

1412
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,180
and accepted understanding of what the

1413
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,118
competencies are how you reach these

1414
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,740
competencies can be in a number of ways

1415
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,619
so I worked throughout my a-levels and

1416
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:04,299
went to evening classes so that was

1417
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:05,800
something that it's actually because of

1418
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,560
the premise that were in place I was

1419
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,930
able to do you can self educate and

1420
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,299
medicine exams there are different ways

1421
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:15,609
of doing things the dip that the

1422
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:18,099
National Occupational standards are that

1423
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:19,750
you are able to demonstrate you are able

1424
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:21,280
to have an assessment at the end that

1425
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,690
says you are competent to do something

1426
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,730
but unless we've got something to assess

1427
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:26,770
against you can't do that so an example

1428
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,330
would be the dermal Medical Council you

1429
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,859
train seven years to become a doctor you

1430
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,779
don't just say right right now I'm gonna

1431
00:54:29,859 --> 00:54:33,670
go be a doctor you have an assessment by

1432
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,170
the GMC and they license you to practice

1433
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,550
and if you fail that assessment chopped

1434
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,950
it's it doesn't matter that you've done

1435
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:40,420
seven years of training you you won't be

1436
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,950
able to do it it's like saying oh well

1437
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,440
I've been learning to drive for ages but

1438
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:45,879
you know driving tasks mean you need to

1439
00:54:44,440 --> 00:55:05,859
have that driving test and that constant

1440
00:54:45,880 --> 00:55:08,630
assessment there's so much what's the

1441
00:55:05,859 --> 00:55:12,000
scoop I can watch it worthless

1442
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:14,040
right you really drive it down there's

1443
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,150
also a charted engineering stuff we're

1444
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,150
just about there

1445
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:26,640
we just destructive like the competing

1446
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,380
all the competing sort of qualitative

1447
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,089
yeah I completely agree there's alone

1448
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,070
and that's something that again should

1449
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:34,170
be change right because the system is

1450
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,460
great it's not good from a technical

1451
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:37,440
point of view for what I want to do but

1452
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,940
for like quality writing in for a lot of

1453
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,030
security stopping to do an incredibly

1454
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,920
useful thing to learn and do yeah yeah I

1455
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,270
completely agree that that needs to

1456
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:52,080
change and then we have this piece each

1457
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:53,730
other people moving around the room and

1458
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,140
having that level of competition as well

1459
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:57,120
actually holds us back it means that we

1460
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,799
don't progress forward because we're not

1461
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,230
getting the right people making a

1462
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,210
unified decision and that's again unless

1463
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,530
I love them but they're done in

1464
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,180
consultation we're done every two years

1465
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,830
and it's industry leaders that make the

1466
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,390
decisions which is why we've changed the

1467
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,920
way that we educate but stay like for

1468
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:13,830
education for example we don't teach in

1469
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,300
the way that we used to anymore it's not

1470
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:17,190
always just about the kind of medical

1471
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,710
adage there's a lot of industries that

1472
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:21,090
have managed to really incorporate new

1473
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,740
ways of doing things because they have

1474
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,360
this base standard that says ok right

1475
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:27,479
well it didn't work it work then it

1476
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,290
doesn't now this is how we move on what

1477
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,420
you're saying we're a psych resident

1478
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:32,970
rating on CPS your peers a really good

1479
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,780
step towards something like yeah I

1480
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:39,299
notice but I'm happy with it at least

1481
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,730
we've had time called so if anybody has

1482
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,560
more questions well lighter and you have

1483
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,920
come and grab and values on but we need
