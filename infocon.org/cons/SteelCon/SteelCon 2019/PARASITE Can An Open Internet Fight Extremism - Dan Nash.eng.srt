1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:09,260
one of these even start this days was

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,190
high New Zealand's Prime Minister to

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:15,350
sender or describe the 15th March 2019 a

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,210
government entered they all nor mosque

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,070
in recorded during the time of the

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,100
Friday prayer I'm the open fire and

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,400
Ackroyd of anywhere from 300 to 500

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,250
people we're not sure after murdering 51

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,759
of them and injuring 49 he proceeded to

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,659
the to the limit Islamic centre and

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,519
software when they were calling saddened

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,428
more and injuring and under no mines

13
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:41,120
I recently he's just pleaded not guilty

14
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:42,409
in a court of law offer but so this

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,909
clear that the government was a violent

16
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:46,460
with that's cleared the gun was violent

17
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:47,719
and since this is a current we've

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,499
learned that he was a white supremacist

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,979
extremist who announced his plans prior

20
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:57,170
to leaving the ice on Iran the politics

21
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,909
orientated board of this Ikea champ

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,079
which is a popular image board which

23
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:04,658
people like this 10 congregate he say he

24
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,940
set up a public live stream and

25
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:11,060
advertised it here and also compared the

26
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,950
mass security I didn't see in the first

27
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,750
line there a real life afferent post

28
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,030
which time he gives the game up this is

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,680
like a that's a clear tie between his

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,120
behavior on the internet and the actions

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,680
which occurred on this day and I just

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,170
like to river it like he didn't pick the

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,270
gum up by chance and like like let's

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,330
talk is essentially exploring how we got

35
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,949
here and hi the system's Richard like

36
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,200
arrogant of functions have enabled this

37
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,610
and potentially what we could do better

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,080
to what was so a few spinners obviously

39
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,360
my opinions on my own don't reflect

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,500
anyone else's my employer would still

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,540
love to take your money even if you

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,400
disagree entirely with everything with

43
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,850
what I say

44
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,350
I don't reflect the opinions the

45
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,770
industry and I'm effectiveness in steel

46
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:03,289
conned so please come back if you're

47
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:06,740
even if you don't like the talk so like

48
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:09,110
this is all like this isn't a published

49
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,599
study I'm not an academic in country

50
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,720
violent extremism and I'm trying to be

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,470
conscious of my own biases but

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,200
and tell you right now that I'm not

53
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,859
trying to mislead you so if you think

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,000
something's wrong

55
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,190
have you think that I've taken results

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,980
in the context I would appreciate it if

57
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,880
you were to let me know rather than

58
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:32,170
lighting me up on Twitter for being

59
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,880
whoever so like obviously I've got a lot

60
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,649
to learn but hopefully you guys also

61
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,380
have something around so there's some

62
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,240
way I can help

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,660
politics is ubiquitous politics is

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,990
everywhere and UK like you can deny this

65
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,549
and say well actually attacking like

66
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,810
tech isn't political and this is a

67
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,490
security conference and just like the

68
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,310
focus and attack but the actions that we

69
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,510
like like the actions we partake in our

70
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,160
daily lives and the things we do for

71
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,950
work day are the political impact on

72
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,310
someone and ignoring them is a political

73
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,019
act in and of itself so again this is

74
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,710
another slide to say if you disagree

75
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,120
with me that's fine

76
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,940
the stuffin of fact and you're certainly

77
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,010
not a bigot for doing so this hope will

78
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,320
also contain references to neo Nazism

79
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,829
white supremacy anti-abortion violence

80
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,120
and radicalism Adam so it's not going to

81
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,830
come around or it's not going to be

82
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,630
mentioned or talked about severely for

83
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,270
another ten minutes so please feel free

84
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,700
gets to pop I did anytime like it's not

85
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,350
a big deal it is being recorded so you

86
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,260
can watch it later skipping that you

87
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,430
want to see and there will be overt

88
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,899
intentional descriptions of political

89
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,910
identities so if that's something

90
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,440
they're not perfectly comfortable with

91
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:49,000
then you call the diversity minimus so

92
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,760
scissor idea recap of the talk I can't

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,030
open internet fight extremism already in

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,130
the begin the Internet has always been a

95
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,900
front line in the battle for freedom of

96
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,730
expression when I stand up an Internet

97
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,320
perhaps I better because I'm a better

98
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,268
phrase or a better term of the word

99
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,590
might be open and free which is used to

100
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,110
describe an Internet which is not only

101
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,010
accessible but also permits a dialogue

102
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,640
of some description

103
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,870
so essentially you could work that in

104
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,418
title how do you protect the people who

105
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,220
are victims of violent extremism

106
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,539
while also keeping the internet open to

107
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,850
this end-to-end open the free speech

108
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,160
because we're we grant responsibility we

109
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:29,350
also grant rights to take action

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,030
and that's not always good so before we

111
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,200
go and talk about extremism on the

112
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,049
internet it might be helpful to

113
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,700
understand what extremism is and I've

114
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,320
just noticed that I interchangeably use

115
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,330
the terms extremism and violent

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,580
extremism and extremism and of itself

117
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:48,940
just means a a radical new point like so

118
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,849
like not all extremism is bad and our

119
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,990
society is in many ways extreme so if

120
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,220
you're really passionate about something

121
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,990
please don't think that I'm trying to

122
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,800
get you booted off the internet it's in

123
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:02,110
that unless it's you know quite nonsense

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,030
so the definition that the the

125
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,770
Department of Homeland Security has in

126
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,109
America is the violent extremism refers

127
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,150
to the beliefs and actions of people who

128
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,480
support or use idea ideologically

129
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,489
motivated violence to achieve radical

130
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,480
radical ideological religious or

131
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,310
political views

132
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,560
so we've comfortably broken installing

133
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,480
into two groups who are wealthy about

134
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,860
the Obama administration did so we've

135
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,540
got ITU which refers to international

136
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,350
terrorist organizations and they've got

137
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,300
HV such as homegrown violent extremist I

138
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,420
mean it's it's not that that's not

139
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,970
always accurate description that's not

140
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,900
that clear-cut because there are

141
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,330
international terrorist organizations

142
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,580
which they mainly use wrong room violent

143
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,830
extremism as a way of like reaching

144
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,840
their ideological goals but again we'll

145
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,280
get to that later so now we know what

146
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,549
the extremism is how does someone become

147
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,719
an extremist why do we like get there

148
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,250
because I assume we're not born

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,400
experiments obviously I don't know but

150
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,919
the specialists refer to the process in

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,929
which we come closer to accepting

152
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,539
violence as a legitimate means to an

153
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,310
ideological religious play goalie okay

154
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,490
and which drive for protectionism as

155
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,460
radicalization

156
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,440
so radicalization tends of two factors

157
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,049
you've got the push factors which tend

158
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,610
to make the the norm shall we say less

159
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,590
attractive for the person I'm with also

160
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,050
the poll factors so the poet the

161
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,489
pressure factors can be a feeling of

162
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,190
like marginalization

163
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,510
so like the things of inequality

164
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,190
discrimination persecution and just

165
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,169
really any ingredients you won't like

166
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,509
there's a lot

167
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,680
like politically violent grips and they

168
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,930
all kind of have their own reasons for

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,599
being politically violent it is invalid

170
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,270
this is next so I'm like really anything

171
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:48,419
and then they'll also make themselves

172
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,789
more attractive as a as a group that you

173
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,948
could join by like being organized and

174
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:54,330
offering employment in exchange for like

175
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,939
service to the scrip or offering money

176
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,960
or like supporting the community that

177
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:03,930
sort of thing something we find quite

178
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,310
common with young homegrown extremists

179
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,050
is that they'll act like a sense of

180
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,800
identity there's a there's no purpose in

181
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,960
their life there either

182
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,349
like a common trope for particularly

183
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,779
white nationalists homegrown extremists

184
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,990
are that they're on employees know a lot

185
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,509
of friends to this stuff so like most of

186
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,460
all like there's a really strong sense

187
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,379
of camaraderie in these groups because

188
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,549
they generally don't really have much

189
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,650
else like there's a real sense of

190
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,270
belonging that this causes Michaels and

191
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:35,638
I'm with my friends and we're fighting

192
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:37,378
for it so like and this where like if

193
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,210
someone talked with online so whenever

194
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,039
we talk about like I'm extremism online

195
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,020
these generally reasons that they do

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,110
this because in the vast majority of

197
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,000
cases and extremists would not be like

198
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,039
on the Internet in ppreciate of their

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,689
actual ideal to go in there we generally

200
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,279
be in support of it so for instance

201
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,009
you've got fundraising because like

202
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,479
obviously this stuff costs money and

203
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,419
there's only so much fun reason you can

204
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,830
do in the high scrape for your political

205
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,000
organization so I almost need to take to

206
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,199
the Internet where they can find people

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,689
who are more sympathetic to their cause

208
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,689
and naturally hopefully make more money

209
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,560
recruitment

210
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,069
so again similarly just being connected

211
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,539
to so many people it gives more more of

212
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,250
a chance for you to recruit people here

213
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,438
so that you didn't Harrison Belvedere

214
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,509
cause you're radicalization which is the

215
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,210
Dajjal discuss the process of making

216
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:29,149
your views seem more palatable more

217
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,490
accessible

218
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,328
trilling so like Italy especially stated

219
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,640
to the international terrorist

220
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,828
organizations that use terror cells

221
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,140
where we have the internet used as a

222
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:43,948
means to distribute training materials

223
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,449
and like YT videos essentially for

224
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:47,949
everything to do with

225
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,660
like their ideology whether that's in

226
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,550
the case of political Islam like literal

227
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,370
like feel like theology and like

228
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,260
education about it and like then going

229
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,730
to like creating your own poison gas and

230
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,610
like Michael ID you get away with an

231
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,230
arson attack and things is not so and

232
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,340
let's see there's intimidation and where

233
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,770
we building world war even worse

234
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,080
familiar with this would be the first

235
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,880
kind of experience that social media had

236
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,410
with why the like widespread terrorism

237
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,950
on on their platform would be Twitter

238
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,079
and Isis so a huge function of Isis

239
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,710
propaganda campaigns and Mayor Lee and

240
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,210
all these was to simply say like like we

241
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,130
are the Caliphate we are back I'm like

242
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,990
it's like a show of force essentially so

243
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,950
it's useful for all these things but

244
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,650
that's that's enough lesson of terrorism

245
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,090
for one section of the talk we're not

246
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,699
going to talk this is talks broken down

247
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,380
into a section will be about the

248
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,570
technology and ended by the extremism on

249
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,210
technology and will end up we start all

250
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,400
the way back in 1969 and we should end

251
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,290
up with the present-day so as you can

252
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,780
tell us a lot of history so there's

253
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,709
gonna be a lot of stuff on this site

254
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,720
what I would like this today would be a

255
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,130
primer rather than the comprehensive

256
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,360
guide and all of the extremism that's

257
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:03,160
ever occurred on the internet and holla

258
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:07,000
visa so a good place is I need to start

259
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,050
would be ARPANET so any and then this

260
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,120
first technology section will be

261
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,620
primarily looking at the

262
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,180
decentralization which occurred in the

263
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,950
design choices off the early internet is

264
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,260
this quite important as so like whenever

265
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,320
we get to the free speech discussion

266
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,720
later on the like the internet and even

267
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,970
it even in this conception if we can

268
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,740
separate what you can't if you can

269
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,650
separate design choices from like a

270
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,880
political ethos essentially the internet

271
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,920
was always set up to be decentralized

272
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,660
and originally there's some debate on

273
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,760
why that is some people say that it's

274
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,850
like this new system so this is the

275
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,880
first diagram drawn with the ARPANET of

276
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,100
the Cova connecting for computers but

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,400
that system works well for a number of

278
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,500
reasons there's John Baron says that the

279
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,319
ARPANET was design make this so it was

280
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,400
on things like like a nuclear war that

281
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,340
will destroy you almost among the

282
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,410
control systems other people disagree

283
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,170
and say

284
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,670
four so like so like anyone in the

285
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,920
United States could easily connective

286
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,310
supercomputer anywhere else that sort of

287
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,130
stuff

288
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,859
so essentially survivable networks was

289
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,570
what that dark net and redundancy is in

290
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,320
the game they're the very core concept

291
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,660
about a couple of years later 20 or so

292
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,150
we end up with Usenet which is a

293
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,329
decentralized system for moving content

294
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,699
and sharing content in which essentially

295
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,890
the the indexers as I believe they're

296
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,020
called will propagate content to the

297
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,730
next ended like to teach and actors it's

298
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,439
connected to so if any one of these

299
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,150
servers are compromised to root on the

300
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,100
information we'll still be able to share

301
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,380
through the decentralized grade and this

302
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,850
is in my feeling I'm not sure the date

303
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,830
of it but it is showing the each

304
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,090
individual connection and actually have

305
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,910
one of those connections disappeared

306
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,950
unless it is like a like a load-bearing

307
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,199
connection and like you should see like

308
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,240
you should still be able to share a tree

309
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,120
so again that's another example of very

310
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,280
early decentralization you got DNS which

311
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,130
is naturally given that you delegate

312
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,470
authority to the name server below um I

313
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,200
mean you don't need to understand a

314
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,300
naturalist all this is an example but

315
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,860
again this is a technical decision

316
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
rather than a political one I'll admit

317
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,680
because the centralized ledger of all

318
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,870
the DNS names on the internet would be

319
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,300
impossible to maintain by the sifts

320
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,910
another step further and then you end up

321
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,699
with BGP which it doesn't require any

322
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,770
sent any or very well like remember but

323
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,390
um it's it reduces the amount of centric

324
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,990
infrastructure required which enables

325
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:34,470
kind of a spider web of the spider web

326
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:37,020
really was the Internet to to propagate

327
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:41,910
so another one for the techno Rotarians

328
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,650
they're moving on with gods the first

329
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,810
kind of instance or the first public

330
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,949
instance of online states way into place

331
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:53,430
so and in 1998 there was a hack Bell

332
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,520
Labs I think who designed the early

333
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,290
systems for the net for the 9-1-1 stuff

334
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,640
in america they got hacked and a

335
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,079
blueprint for one of the systems was

336
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,510
leaked on the quad should be the axes

337
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,720
across the country and one of these VBS

338
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,780
is is run in a boardgame store owned by

339
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,610
mr. Steve Jackson and because it here he

340
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,140
had a copy of this on those BBS someone

341
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,370
but there they read they raided his

342
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,930
ready to shop took off his computer

343
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,339
equipment that he was using to make the

344
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,290
game that the studio was selling and

345
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:28,769
then left for I think three and a half

346
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:31,110
months so they took him to court they

347
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,360
won the the judge called the prep the

348
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,760
warrant sloppy and advised that the US

349
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,890
Secret Service requires better education

350
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,269
regarding the law around free speech so

351
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,510
I was funny and they had no basis to

352
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:44,760
hold computers like based on like what

353
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,290
happened so this is quite a federal case

354
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,390
and it also represents the beginning of

355
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,019
the e FF because this is the case in

356
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:56,240
which the the Electronic Frontier

357
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:59,940
Foundation set up to to protect so

358
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,339
there's also the case book burn

359
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,959
Steinberg versus the United States which

360
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,399
is also represented by the F F legal

361
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,260
team I mean this is only tangentially

362
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,670
related but again another kind of talk

363
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,100
when it comes to the internet and it

364
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,790
being kind of a frontier for a listen

365
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,959
any conversation where they decided that

366
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,300
you couldn't restrict source food being

367
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,459
released because it was a unless it's Co

368
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,839
pricey because it's a like the way in

369
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,839
which she solve a problem through code

370
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:29,029
is speech so from there interesting so

371
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,660
the next kind of related on or relevant

372
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,760
statute I could find was the

373
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,930
Communications Decency Act in 1996 so

374
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,769
primarily that was a act to stop

375
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,810
dassault porn being spread on the

376
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:46,920
internet which obviously did not work

377
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:47,849
because we know yeah so on the

378
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,910
distinction I find quite interesting

379
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,279
because it's all the television screen

380
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,829
or it's on the radio or it's like um or

381
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,140
it's and like in the physical world it's

382
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:59,489
like being presented to you but on the

383
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,319
internet you need to take a series of

384
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,800
affirmative steps in order to access is

385
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,220
this some explosive content so content

386
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,109
via spans are unconstitutional so on the

387
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,510
the first amendment essentially splits

388
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,839
that speech up or hi it decides for free

389
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,149
speeches into a time matter place and

390
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,449
content based so for content based on

391
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,339
bans obviously it's like if someone

392
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,760
decides on time other places where and

393
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,860
why

394
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,430
in the context and when she said it and

395
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,290
content based bands are essentially

396
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,449
there IIIi think there are some like

397
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,160
edge cases this is someone going to

398
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,620
orbit this in May but they're very hard

399
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,010
to pass by the US government as you can

400
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:45,600
imagine listen

401
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,160
so what wait like hey guys read porn

402
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,860
right well we care about obviously is

403
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,219
the freedom of information and so in

404
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,080
section 230 of the CM Act it said no

405
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,880
provider or user of an interactive

406
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,710
computer service shall be treated as the

407
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,050
publisher or speaker of any information

408
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,660
provided by another information content

409
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,109
provided her provider which essentially

410
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,660
means that if I run the service and you

411
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:12,600
post something which might be bad on my

412
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,100
service I am NOT responsible for like

413
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,230
slightly like simply for holding that

414
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,310
that's like simply for hosting the

415
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:24,930
equipment and what she posts it because

416
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:27,180
essentially mmm-hmm I started a business

417
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,890
you know it's it's quite interesting

418
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,339
because it's like simply by hosting the

419
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,510
content itself you know a publisher over

420
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,280
you're simply a distributor and

421
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,170
naturally like it might be think of it

422
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,660
in a more kind of like human context

423
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,339
like holding distributors like liable

424
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,430
for the content of every single thing

425
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,140
that if it would be quite difficult and

426
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,609
also wouldn't make much sense seeing as

427
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,580
there's other people involved with the

428
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,410
actual creation of our content so I'm

429
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,810
early on in the 1990s just after

430
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,750
dialogue started in America there were

431
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:01,020
two providers that we care about

432
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,510
CompuServe and prodigy and CompuServe

433
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,889
refused as a policy to regulate any of

434
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:10,140
the content that it's um it's it's

435
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,390
usually posted on anything so if I was

436
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,709
MFIs CompuServe is my ISP and I

437
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,690
connected to something I posted it you

438
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,640
wouldn't be able to actually see complex

439
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,290
a I posted my Bible or something you can

440
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,730
sue them for hosting out information

441
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,250
because they point-blank refused to

442
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,599
moderate it a stole that prodigy on the

443
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,849
other hand did employ a team of

444
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,980
moderators and was active in attempting

445
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:32,459
to moderate and place the content which

446
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,650
is posted using its service and both of

447
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,779
them were sued for things that are users

448
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,700
posted and

449
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:39,529
my prodigy lost this because they'd

450
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,029
actually tried to moderate an in

451
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,320
moderation or actually became a

452
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,960
publisher because they were saying yes

453
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,408
no yes no so it's just interesting

454
00:17:44,960 --> 00:18:00,200
because when we get to social media the

455
00:17:48,409 --> 00:18:02,960
open know them I love actually oh really

456
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:12,019
hey I got a new idea I've had an actual

457
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:18,969
recent email address opportunity Intel

458
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:18,969
said who's vanished off the economic

459
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:26,478
certainty hates to vanish he's not using

460
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,859
they somehow try to connect at its where

461
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,509
because I haven't heard anything about

462
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,109
that on the internet which only further

463
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,109
supports

464
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:42,379
okay no and I'd and if a deferens tree I

465
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,379
live I apologize for misrepresenting

466
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:57,619
conversation so no I will discuss attack

467
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,619
all the way up essentially to me

468
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,989
obviously this kind of like technology

469
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:11,489
and the decentralization behind it was

470
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:13,320
huge at the time with a certain subset

471
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:15,059
of people who care very much about their

472
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,509
ability to speak freely and those who

473
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:20,759
were kind of like had let's say English

474
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,200
interests in which they kindly go out on

475
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,849
the street and say so this kind of

476
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,529
decentralized internet where I can

477
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:26,879
connect the anyone would be anything

478
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:31,109
well they appealed to a lot of people

479
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:35,759
and one of those people was Sir Murphy

480
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:38,519
who was a Grand Dragon of the clans well

481
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,869
I believe and was essentially according

482
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,759
to reports in Berkshire and the bottom

483
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:43,619
was a Condon all of his life having

484
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,869
played children's games when he refused

485
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:46,889
to be anything other than the south what

486
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:48,599
like when they like when they did

487
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:51,829
several warrior accidents and stuff and

488
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:54,689
he went to Vietnam on the pond returned

489
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:56,099
essentially was better applied the lack

490
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,109
of victory and the weakness of the

491
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:59,939
government because if you remember the

492
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:02,849
government eventually pulled out by the

493
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,709
Vietnam War and which is quite weird

494
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:06,718
because up until this time or up until

495
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:08,190
around by this time the seventies the

496
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:10,469
KKK and the government were actually

497
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,149
quite closely linked and well in many

498
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:14,940
cases is proving to be the same people

499
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:16,649
so the reason why Louis Baima is quite

500
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,859
significant here and I've picked on him

501
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,149
personally is that his writings reflect

502
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,589
this at the time because the enemies

503
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:24,629
weren't just like Leone's little

504
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:27,629
excremental you don't know the click

505
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:30,658
respond is a like white supremacist

506
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:32,428
organization in the US which is like

507
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:38,089
politics can essentially be reduced on

508
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:39,389
to America for Americans like is very

509
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:42,060
yeah

510
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:45,270
I've ever ever

511
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:48,090
but the difference is in the 1980s and

512
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,690
70s their writings went from anyone who

513
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,639
was in white

514
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,410
she anyone was in white and anyone who

515
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,940
stood against their ideology so that's

516
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,930
like the government that's like whites

517
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,790
who weren't like what like them like

518
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:03,300
really just any and anything wasn't them

519
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:06,720
so to reflect this the KKK picked up a

520
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,800
new kind of organization strategy shall

521
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,450
we say called leaderless resistance

522
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,520
which is essentially advocated for

523
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,620
political groups like the KKK to be

524
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,170
organized into two parts so one part

525
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,239
would be the political arm which would

526
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,500
practice no violence whatsoever and will

527
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,330
only attempt to achieve their aims

528
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,980
through the political process and free

529
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,860
drag an entirely non radical peaceful

530
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,240
stuff and the second level of it would

531
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,949
be unaffiliated like Tyra Sal grips who

532
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,990
would carry out violence in the name

533
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,850
Africa and I'm like to the same

534
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,680
ideological lens but just not

535
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,209
affiliating themselves and operating

536
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,480
alone like individually or in small

537
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:47,520
groups that sort of thing so in 1984

538
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,050
being set up the organization's Liberty

539
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,889
net and I would like to get a photo for

540
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:54,120
it because I might been told that the

541
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,180
the resistance baby I said were quite

542
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,860
creative in their use of slash strings

543
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,210
to kind of illustrate don't come in here

544
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,469
if although I wasn't able to find a

545
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,760
photo I certainly didn't wanna try

546
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,860
connect so I put an example post one of

547
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,170
the first post BIOS fame was imagine if

548
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,790
you will all agree all the great minds

549
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,290
of the patriotic Christian movement

550
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,870
linked together and joined into one

551
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,730
computer imagine any period in the

552
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,489
country being able to call up and access

553
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:24,030
these minds we are online with the Aryan

554
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:26,490
Nations brain trust it is here to serve

555
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,290
the folk the possibilities have only

556
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,200
been touched upon Punta del Este by

557
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,129
giving he was right like the

558
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,930
possibilities of this kind of technology

559
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,700
and highly would enable extremists who

560
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,800
generally wouldn't find out much

561
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,020
consolidated support in their like local

562
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,149
area like that like this kind of stuff

563
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,040
was groundbreaking and this was one of

564
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:48,330
the and this was quite an early BBS as

565
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,580
well are in mostly called Aria nations

566
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,980
already know yeah so there was also the

567
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,629
white ardian resistance set up by Tom

568
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,730
Metzger

569
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:00,690
and then George dykes would set up the

570
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,460
Liberty Bell Network and after the fact

571
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,110
so as I'm still reeling from the

572
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,600
illustrate here is that white

573
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:09,330
supremacist in America Devin that like I

574
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,219
know that this is GX centric so far but

575
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,658
I'm gonna tribute that's to the fact

576
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,490
that the technology was kind of

577
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,140
pioneered in America and we were simply

578
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,480
like after the fact like there is grips

579
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,010
here in the UK like homebody a team and

580
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,450
a few others which did use kind of very

581
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,129
early internet to communicate and like

582
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,840
connect with these guys and a lot

583
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,860
through the stuff Bob like we're

584
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,730
definitely just went into grips you

585
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:31,500
could talk about them old guy so a lot

586
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,440
of people interested in trying to spread

587
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,149
that message a high-profile case moving

588
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,520
away from my supremacy for a bet was the

589
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:40,110
urine burg files in which I'm not sure

590
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,149
how many people know this actually the

591
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,428
among young nervous because I certainly

592
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:47,428
didn't but and the abortion extremism

593
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:50,520
was spectacularly violent three I mean

594
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:53,789
like 70s and 80s and 90s having killed I

595
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,370
think in the double digits of doctors

596
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:59,760
who have practice and bombed multiple

597
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,590
abortion clinics throughout yes so it

598
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,158
definitely changes I think about this

599
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:10,459
guy marks something I thought I had his

600
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:13,409
name but some some household set up the

601
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,120
set up the site called the Nuremberg

602
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:16,860
files were listed the names and

603
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,029
addresses of a whole bunch of doctors

604
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:23,100
that he knew his the thing a carry load

605
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:26,669
abortions citing that it was free speech

606
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:29,010
because he believes that abortion would

607
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:33,590
eventually be legalized and recognized

608
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:35,850
the war crime it is and he didn't want

609
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,408
essentially I think he compared it to

610
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,209
the Nuremberg trials as you can see and

611
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,740
said that a whole bunch of people who

612
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,390
committed war crimes in Nazi Germany got

613
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,820
away and he didn't want the same thing

614
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,610
that happened to these but this is

615
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,860
actually an example of high hate speech

616
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,299
is in lights because I mean my guys

617
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,219
we've been clearly seen like this blood

618
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:55,710
along the top of the webpage like

619
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,490
visualize abortionist on trial that was

620
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,840
marketed and flyer going to extreme

621
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,090
anti-abortion groups with like proven

622
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,590
histories of violence and then he sticks

623
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,240
their name and their kids name and their

624
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,629
address link next to the next day like

625
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,389
it's not

626
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:11,799
I've likable so yeah the reason why I

627
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:15,728
want to highlight this is because he was

628
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:19,749
eventually prosecuted for it and the

629
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:22,209
site was ordered to be taken down but

630
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:23,949
it's just like a little firmer for later

631
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:25,329
the laborious conversation about free

632
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:26,919
speech where we do talk about Kenneth

633
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:28,690
this idea I'm absolutely Speights and

634
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,879
they can say anything provided it's not

635
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,259
a credible throughout because the

636
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:33,698
dissent of not being able to say

637
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:35,829
anything would be too much right it's

638
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:40,619
like this isn't the case and never

639
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:42,969
really husband Riker Steven Lee vine of

640
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:45,549
Politico I think said in his 1997

641
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:48,789
article blaming the web that the web is

642
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:51,129
a powerful extremely low cost

643
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:53,199
information amplifier but promulgates

644
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,178
the ravings of millennial had hisses as

645
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:58,059
effectively as it knows speeches by Bill

646
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,529
Gates or ads for liquor so for the price

647
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,940
of it for the price is like a single

648
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:02,739
website I know not all the Nuremberg

649
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,359
files were there was a poster campaign

650
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:07,569
but the website got infinitely more

651
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:10,149
attraction like like for just a design

652
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:11,859
and the hosting of that like

653
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,149
marginalized extremist groups can easily

654
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:15,579
reach an audience of thousands and the

655
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:18,008
new mom who becomes an idea of like

656
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:20,019
having a limited message like it's very

657
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,429
very I wouldn't say easy but it's

658
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:27,519
certainly possible to get your message

659
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:28,749
out there for thousands so when we talk

660
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,940
with you open Internet around the

661
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:32,769
beginning of the 21st century we moved

662
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,149
away from BBS's and styling kind of

663
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:39,399
websites to what that is referred to as

664
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:43,718
web 2.0 actually never going to set up

665
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:46,238
for is ever again I'm gonna set up the

666
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:48,669
the participatory web which essentially

667
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:51,879
enabled websites to scale up with their

668
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,489
user base rather than just like the the

669
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:56,799
separating essentially rule of content

670
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:58,509
creator and service provider to enable

671
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,190
users to share content and for that

672
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,229
content to be up to the driving force

673
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,589
behind they like appeal by the site

674
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:06,459
right

675
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:08,829
so examples lists are like I died like

676
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:10,389
I'm not trying to dodge the question but

677
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:12,009
examples this or literally everywhere

678
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:14,649
like their I can't think of many sites

679
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:17,619
which are still a like original web

680
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:20,369
start like hosting saying except for

681
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,369
like you know more

682
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,600
let me see

683
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,860
so again like going into the next

684
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,550
section it's important to remember that

685
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,030
not yet

686
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:33,010
this is like the MEC 2000 1000 2003 the

687
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:35,678
web while it's really like it's really

688
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,700
penetrated like our society in our life

689
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,470
and it's very difficult to be a

690
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,059
participant right now without

691
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,410
interacting with the web this still was

692
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,850
not the case there were plenty of people

693
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,170
who did not use the web their entire

694
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,120
lives going through this period and

695
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,010
they'd find so that's the something

696
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,629
important when we like frank about to

697
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,220
like the speech and like there's got the

698
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,100
right to be on myspace and that sort of

699
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,570
thing and like I just like in the back

700
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,120
you had saying about fire that changes

701
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,559
when we start to rely on these kind of

702
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,809
services more and when they start to

703
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,210
make up more of our lives because like

704
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,980
if and I'll take an example of lengthen

705
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,750
turns out to be an extremist hotbed like

706
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:13,480
you like it simply does not go on like

707
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:16,120
them but this this feels kinda goes away

708
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,860
but yeah basically Facebook started 2004

709
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,570
on the scale and Rochester illustrate

710
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:24,280
the scale free ahead a million users in

711
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:27,970
under a year oh yeah had a million users

712
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,889
in under a year Google was starving 300

713
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:33,460
million searches every single day in

714
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:35,800
2004 and YouTube was created in 2005 I

715
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,230
miss bought a year and a half later I

716
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,210
think my by Google for an extortioner

717
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,470
made the money and then Google also

718
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,720
bought double-click straight after that

719
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,270
which essentially was the beginning of

720
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,850
Google's gonna I don't know say monopoly

721
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:53,820
with monopoly like web advertising yeah

722
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,510
and then 12 a vision 2006 last panic

723
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,939
where we get to here

724
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,950
so until insects myspace had 100 million

725
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,230
users still quite ahead of Facebook and

726
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,450
this was jest just before it was sold

727
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,610
for however many only like 580 million

728
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,500
and when people were starting to get

729
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,909
weary other sort of the implications

730
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,350
let's tack right because like it's no

731
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,640
longer this the fun project like a mall

732
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,860
long with my friends like people are

733
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,140
actively concerned then there was a

734
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,889
massive outcry by the general attorney

735
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,090
up at Cincinnati to get sex offenders

736
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,429
off of MySpace

737
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,928
given that they liked very like everyone

738
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,030
signed up with a real name and there was

739
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:30,289
a couple of like suspected previous is

740
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,619
easing the plan

741
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:37,609
in 2007 after a series of lawsuits they

742
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:41,539
removed 90,000 saxon hunters from their

743
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:45,079
platforms with 100 million users sources

744
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:47,450
for this grouping but notice here that

745
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:48,769
they're getting removed simply because

746
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,299
of a characteristic of their like

747
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:51,799
identity like under the my guy that's

748
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:53,658
like it's probably legal to do this and

749
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:55,940
it kind of has been done before and it

750
00:29:53,659 --> 00:30:00,079
continues to happen all over the place

751
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,479
but that's not all in 2007 um the

752
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:06,190
conservative youtuber michelle malkin

753
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:09,190
was censored by having her body removed

754
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,239
and ben smith wrote the article the

755
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,629
Internet vulnerable to free speech

756
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:16,849
issues are calling the Mark Zuckerberg

757
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:19,099
and others Eric Schmidt book illegal The

758
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,839
Chieftains of the Internet and said that

759
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:22,489
a machine that won't be the government

760
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,129
which is sensing our speech that will be

761
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:27,589
the owners of these platforms in which

762
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:33,408
we interact with the world which was

763
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:35,208
quite prophetic but in 2007 it's worth

764
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:37,609
noting that their stance on a hateful

765
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:40,039
content was unlawful of seeing

766
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:41,989
defamatory libellous threatening

767
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,200
pornographic harassing he had fault or

768
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:47,239
richly or ethnically offenses or

769
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,649
encourages cons encourages conduct that

770
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:51,349
will be considered a criminal offence

771
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:53,689
give rise to civil liability violate any

772
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,458
law or is otherwise inappropriate so

773
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,379
quite wide stretching and I really don't

774
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:58,909
think that we'd get away with that today

775
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:02,869
but that's essentially what the crack

776
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:05,690
was in 2007 something else with YouTube

777
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:08,449
that happened in 2007 as well it stopped

778
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,009
going from a kind of like blog site in

779
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,279
which content was separated into

780
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:16,489
searches or profiles so for instance as

781
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,519
an example if I were to YouTube before

782
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:21,679
was essentially a group of channels in

783
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,209
which you could search yourself but and

784
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,799
so like it essentially if you didn't

785
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:26,299
want to see content all you had to do is

786
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,739
simply not search for it again we're

787
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:29,959
talking about those kind of like a sort

788
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:33,739
of steps to get the content in which you

789
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:36,139
find offensive or rather awful or etc

790
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:37,730
right in 2007 they introduced the

791
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:39,918
centralized feed that

792
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,510
that essentially you could argue you

793
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,580
give up some of your free speech rights

794
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:46,250
during like three participation right

795
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,260
because but yes I have heard like I have

796
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,120
the right to shout but if I go to your

797
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,100
funeral and sites I'm not going to be

798
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,260
very well received so like the context

799
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,939
in which we say these things and indeed

800
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,950
the sites in which we upload things if

801
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,799
they're going to be like if I have a lot

802
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,639
of years on my blog and then the and

803
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,899
bikes just the sheer volume of the like

804
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:07,428
participation on my video propels it on

805
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:08,449
the essential platformer everyone can

806
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:08,929
see it now there's something to be

807
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,450
considered

808
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:16,190
in terms of whether we should enable

809
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:17,870
those on enable lose did you see what I

810
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,519
actually tried to find out which video

811
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,899
that's article is referring to when it

812
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,220
turns out she's been banned by YouTube

813
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:27,229
so many times I couldn't actually know

814
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:30,470
if I'm the one so it's like I'm that's

815
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,240
the thing like with this kind of

816
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,590
political discourse where is the option

817
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,590
to join where is the option to opt in

818
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:38,209
like is it so that if those political

819
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,399
discourses are not interested in I have

820
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,830
the opt I did the entire service to get

821
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:49,969
away from it like this is just like some

822
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:51,668
questions so moving on the development

823
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,080
of the web was obviously a gold mine for

824
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:56,659
white supremacist organizations as we

825
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,760
we'll know annoy given that storm front

826
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:01,070
which came active in the early noughties

827
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,929
was a public forum which anyone could

828
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,450
rise and anyone could create a client

829
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:08,539
enjoying so this is again going back to

830
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,700
those kind of uses of external scripts

831
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:12,730
this is the radicalization and

832
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:16,990
recruitment aspect right and recently

833
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:20,120
we've seen the ideally exterminate

834
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,250
successor spare the spiritual successor

835
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,620
to the site release a style guide in

836
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,590
which they require all of their writers

837
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,570
to never be explicitly and only resist

838
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,279
until only like it's like essentially

839
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,379
you can given calyx longline research

840
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,809
daily stormer style guide but it's some

841
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,250
like it errors explicit instructions for

842
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:40,460
writings on these kind of websites to

843
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,169
not be like too extreme like they're

844
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,730
like they went to the extreme I don't

845
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:45,559
want on the lives not up but they'd also

846
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,230
want to remain attractive to the people

847
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:51,120
whose minds chefs quite on there yet so

848
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:54,029
listen can you know on these Pleasant

849
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:59,969
folk on the UM on the left on left hand

850
00:33:54,029 --> 00:34:02,970
side there are um forget top vote front

851
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:06,539
and Hammerstein nation so on the right

852
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:08,190
we've got an example of the internet

853
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,440
being used for like further idealization

854
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,470
and recruitment and on the Left Volks

855
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,570
front and Commerce Commission were

856
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:17,310
actually existing neo-nazi groups long

857
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,649
before the internet was a thing and they

858
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:22,649
used kind of a bulletin like a bulletin

859
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:24,359
board cell phone and to kind of like

860
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,489
organizer than themselves and distribute

861
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:31,319
like training materials on top of events

862
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:33,118
a lot sort of thing so in the end this

863
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,649
is actually the beginning the storm

864
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,619
front was indeed the beginning of this

865
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:39,888
kind of ironic and what we now refer to

866
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:42,869
as Krypton fascism where essentially

867
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:44,700
people well the disingenuous about what

868
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,619
their true intentions are and indeed

869
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,710
like clearly be affiliated with

870
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,210
communities which are violent extremists

871
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,159
about it but men key in that distance

872
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,480
and like it is quite hard to the

873
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,159
beginning guys because obviously I want

874
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,470
them gone but exactly how you go about

875
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,700
doing that with like giving service

876
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,770
providers and indeed the government the

877
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,960
ability to squash any dissent that they

878
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:07,619
can some I tie in this is some sort of

879
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,530
extremist group so moving away when

880
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,440
supremacist we've got home we've also

881
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,569
about Al Qaeda so this is a bet before

882
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,520
Isis and telling us the reason typical

883
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:19,349
Qaeda was because Isis has so much on

884
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,210
the internet about them that for me to

885
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,740
condense it into any kind of like fair

886
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,520
representation would be impossible so

887
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:29,359
I'm al Qaeda is much more simple and

888
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,920
illustrates the points just as well so

889
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,750
so according to research done into the

890
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,460
grips over in the Middle East there was

891
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,619
an initial hesitancy to actually use the

892
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,560
internet because there was debates at

893
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:41,579
some by some of the clerics like the

894
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,750
internet was actually just a Jewish

895
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:48,180
conspiracy so when they did that

896
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,190
actually decide use it they used it to

897
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,200
great success and they use it

898
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,280
essentially as a propaganda machine like

899
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,439
they wanted to share them from

900
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,819
information to all of their rumors

901
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,740
everyone familiar with al Qaeda

902
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,880
essentially they were like one of the

903
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,180
first

904
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,940
my radical azimuth grips to have terror

905
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,290
cells all over the world and indeed that

906
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,820
was the purpose of them using the

907
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,830
internet so you kind of I tie these guys

908
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,560
together like with a calls which is

909
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,569
there until I keep the morale high and

910
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,160
to also kind of spread that like

911
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,440
identity like forever

912
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm trying accrue more people so

913
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,160
according to Jane's Intelligence Review

914
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:27,930
2006 ìgee

915
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,350
there was a board on yachts right there

916
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:33,410
was a board on Yahoo which stayed up for

917
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:37,110
the entirety of young people's which

918
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:41,879
al-qaeda used to summon and propaganda

919
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:45,630
but essentially the orchestration of the

920
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,880
internet and other tools like this was

921
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,730
done I mean by thousands of highly

922
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,160
isolated individuals broadly and I began

923
00:36:50,730 --> 00:37:01,680
by their kind of violent extremism to

924
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:03,770
excuse me lost my notes again so the

925
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,910
main issue I write I read the entire

926
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,410
genes intelligence we and it's actually

927
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,180
quite good it goes and a lot into the

928
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,620
kind of things which will almost seem

929
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,960
pathetic pathetic when it comes to

930
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,759
talking about extremism later but the

931
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,770
biggest issue that I the first was that

932
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,010
their training they didn't have access

933
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,060
to proper like content creation

934
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,800
mechanisms they had a lot of stuff

935
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,390
around making this stuff I had seen

936
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,300
prettier but in terms of actually making

937
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,270
good training guides that was their

938
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,980
problem so it's interesting by the bumps

939
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,860
the people at under the sink but

940
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,540
obviously the war on terror was a thing

941
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,710
and there was a lot of opposition to al

942
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,930
Qaeda basically every developed country

943
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,240
in the world was working against in

944
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:47,390
Assam form another so the infrastructure

945
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,390
they had didn't stay up for long so the

946
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:54,120
so the al Qaeda media machine as it

947
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,120
referred to it's been essentially broken

948
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,100
down into three different by types of

949
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,980
content you've got the like my mother

950
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,600
sites and this is where ful the original

951
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,700
content is created this is where you get

952
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,860
the education from the like to have the

953
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,359
scholars this is where you get the like

954
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,190
the actual nodes of troop movements and

955
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,520
the grind in the Middle East this is

956
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,020
where you get like the actual content

957
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,609
and these obviously go down a lot so

958
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,320
that necessitates the roles and

959
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:21,089
distributors which are essentially

960
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,619
people who will aggregate the content

961
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:24,359
from the mother sites and download it

962
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,640
the second they see it up and then they

963
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,799
will hold it there and use things like

964
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,450
mailing lists and things like usual

965
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,010
posted sites like geo cities in the are

966
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,080
keyboards and all that sort of stuff to

967
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,760
I gathered up as soon as possible so

968
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,980
like once a length stick and arm they've

969
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,910
got another link and keeping track of it

970
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,150
and having the vampire to get rid of it

971
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:47,848
in time is incredibly difficult because

972
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,300
it was costly and AI wasn't so much of a

973
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:51,960
thing

974
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,460
bokman Yahoo boards was popular so like

975
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,810
assembly the manpower required to take

976
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,369
on this process and effort to keep this

977
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,410
up would have been too much so they

978
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:01,710
didn't and we got attacked

979
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:05,129
so another thing like another bit of

980
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:07,020
this enjoys it up a little bit of our

981
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:09,450
decentralization there was the use of

982
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,000
email lists and user boards so like

983
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,740
simply from sending an annual can send

984
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,270
them to the mailing list until every

985
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,339
single person who receives it well I

986
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:24,150
receive a copy of whatever kind of

987
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:25,830
program mother is so very trusting and

988
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,270
there's a few examples but we are tied

989
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,540
for climate so I'm gonna skip I then I

990
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:32,820
hope nobody minds so yeah

991
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,880
entry points my unless design aspect

992
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,650
because while social media today like

993
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,290
essentially bombards also the stuff that

994
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,670
wasn't so easy back on the internet that

995
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,710
was required to be hidden because it

996
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,720
wasn't heading then they do die they go

997
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,910
to the actual box and shut it off once

998
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,020
they find out where it was so there was

999
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,670
a fee entry points there were

1000
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,250
directories again the distributors are

1001
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,500
maintained updated links to the like to

1002
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,400
the mother sites ful and plot those

1003
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,140
anywhere they kids

1004
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,990
mailing lists and message boards as

1005
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,390
discussed and also quite interestingly

1006
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:05,129
they non interactive home pages of

1007
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,960
sympathizers like things like memorial

1008
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,359
pages and things like this unrelated

1009
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,220
that's a content al-qaeda would actually

1010
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,509
hide lengths to existing websites in

1011
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,919
there and then spread through what am i

1012
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,230
phone email and other kind of private

1013
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,780
communications that these lengths were

1014
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:20,310
like they give you access to Java

1015
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,540
content right because once you're in one

1016
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,509
website they all linked to each other

1017
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:29,009
you can find all them

1018
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:31,410
yeah again producers so living on phenom

1019
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,540
we've got the we're moving towards

1020
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:36,000
centralization and this is where that's

1021
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,830
a bit tricky because before this it was

1022
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,240
simply a conversation about like when I

1023
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,759
can ever talk about free speech and why

1024
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,779
do we enable like violent extremists on

1025
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,550
the system that we've built this

1026
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,580
internet we're suddenly talking about

1027
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:49,770
the individuals right to say what they

1028
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,930
want right like a like a we agree that

1029
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,640
the second the violence isn't good and a

1030
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:55,950
few other things which I forgot my did

1031
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,569
of the restroom but it's fine but we

1032
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,740
like it's important to remember that

1033
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,570
this far back is maintenance how to be

1034
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:05,549
sex we have had a definition of what

1035
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:08,250
hate speeches so no then nobody enjoys

1036
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:11,310
when the internet centralizes I wonder a

1037
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:15,510
little bit so wer see which flex

1038
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:17,490
advertising revenue are stats has caused

1039
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,080
predicted that internet revenue outside

1040
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:23,609
of Facebook and Google is going to be

1041
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:29,220
gone by 5% or not rises Hall in some

1042
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:31,550
cases here we have Amazon Apple Facebook

1043
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,080
Microsoft and health for that have made

1044
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,510
431 acquisitions worth over a hundred

1045
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,310
and fifty five point seven billion

1046
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,590
without actually being without having

1047
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,620
the proper antitrust investigation

1048
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,330
summons them and their as a there was a

1049
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,100
streak well I mean there are

1050
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,750
investigations but none that actually

1051
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,670
meant anything and they did have the

1052
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,290
stats for how long the streak of like to

1053
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,950
make uninterrupted acquisitions with no

1054
00:41:52,290 --> 00:42:00,150
interests monkey trust but will have to

1055
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:03,060
do with like and Amazon noise has 50% of

1056
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:05,670
all e-commerce in the United States so

1057
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,110
what began as again going all the way

1058
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:11,070
back to the first section what began as

1059
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,330
a collection of decentralized ideas to

1060
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,160
make the world more connected with like

1061
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,500
relying on anyone Authority is very

1062
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,490
quickly going back into the world where

1063
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,230
we are relying on those authorities

1064
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:22,770
where we have to choose and service

1065
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:25,320
providers a three a a nimble amount of

1066
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,030
reasons have provided services which

1067
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,100
people want to stay on like for instance

1068
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,570
with social media nobody wants to do in

1069
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,730
the social media when no one else is is

1070
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,830
the whole point of it right like it's so

1071
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,460
like would flow will find it incredibly

1072
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,290
hard for

1073
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,660
like any competition to come along to

1074
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:42,029
like say spoken and like when Instagram

1075
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,230
they put on they bought it so we show a

1076
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,000
little sugar it's supposed to do and

1077
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,440
then for things like I like other

1078
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,450
services so my time and payment

1079
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,610
processors and email hosting are lots of

1080
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,990
the stuff when indeed Amazon with the

1081
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,980
telemetry and just kind of the nature

1082
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,140
and watch you interact with these

1083
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,580
services it's hard to beat that kind of

1084
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,040
market research and when you don't have

1085
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,650
access to that because they can cut you

1086
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,210
in jail for getting access to it it's

1087
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,270
incredibly hard to compete with them so

1088
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,650
slowly and slowly I believe we're going

1089
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,880
to enter in more and more centralized

1090
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,230
internet and not this interesting

1091
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,380
implications your free speech Frank

1092
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:16,250
because surely our freedom to say what

1093
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,660
we want it matters just as much as the

1094
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,910
speech which is inherent in the action

1095
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,259
to deny you service my platform because

1096
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,629
like it's a sense of speech and of

1097
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,810
itself if I decide that I do not want a

1098
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,920
certain type of person on my platform so

1099
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,180
given the obvious imbalance of power

1100
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,520
there and given the obvious like

1101
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,589
misaligned incentives right because at

1102
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,450
the end of the day these are all

1103
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:38,460
companies and companies are there to

1104
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,939
make money and not to stop extraneous

1105
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:44,910
we're not really sure how we're going to

1106
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,560
do so essentially I've named this

1107
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,850
section plausible deniability and the

1108
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,240
absence of action because I think that

1109
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:54,450
really defines how we look at it because

1110
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,359
as we felt like and all of the examples

1111
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,620
earlier they didn't just go away when so

1112
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,960
when I start talking about that they

1113
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,900
have an active in every single solution

1114
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,760
like I like it and every single aspect

1115
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,470
of our internet life and i am i hope

1116
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,670
this stuff the way zealots River and I

1117
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,169
hope the soft white be the axes is an

1118
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,080
awesome thing was illustrating that

1119
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,850
point but no there is like because of

1120
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,529
this amounts of just mentioning the the

1121
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:19,650
fact that we're no longer working in the

1122
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:20,940
government to stop this some this abuse

1123
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,070
of our rights would rather service

1124
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,360
providers we're seeing essentially an

1125
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,000
action it's like we can't do anything

1126
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:30,990
because we're not allowed to do right so

1127
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,730
for those who remember Alex Jones was on

1128
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,560
the etheric subcommittee you can think

1129
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:38,280
of for an incredibly large number eight

1130
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,060
years while also on publicly like on his

1131
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,160
own radio show

1132
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:45,029
Manji which is quite rare but these with

1133
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,850
these boys like essentially like

1134
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,520
referring to what we call dog whistles

1135
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,400
right it's

1136
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,259
like it said that's essentially like

1137
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,700
violent extremism but they hint that

1138
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,080
it's not like they're not saying it

1139
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,270
right because all death wrap but they're

1140
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,250
definitely at the gamut and then they

1141
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:02,110
for loosing I'm familiar the concept of

1142
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:05,140
white genocide or white replacement is

1143
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:06,910
the conspiracy theory which involves the

1144
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,730
demographic changes in the Western world

1145
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:12,640
to be intentional and orchestrated

1146
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:15,250
against the white people so here we have

1147
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,350
Alex Jones a incredibly popular talk

1148
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,700
show host a was active on Spotify

1149
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,230
exactly Facebook he was active on

1150
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,419
Twitter essentially everything for a

1151
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,770
fusion reviews and despite behavior like

1152
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,170
this and people reporting it when it

1153
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:30,040
happened was never removed until I

1154
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:33,790
believe it was his his lost he was sued

1155
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,050
by he was Charlie yeah yeah there was

1156
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:37,270
sandy hoping thing I was he sued or

1157
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,820
charged anyway it was proven that he was

1158
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:41,440
a piece of so they got mocking in

1159
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,320
this is essentially this took so long

1160
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,390
and these signs one like the signs

1161
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,490
weren't invisible sure there is a debate

1162
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,618
to be had between exactly what this

1163
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,479
interprets from what I'm asking this

1164
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:53,680
potentially we can start having that the

1165
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,780
bit because of the minute there is

1166
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,850
there's like none of it right I guess

1167
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:03,250
essentially you're either a violent

1168
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:05,380
extremist or you're not at all a violent

1169
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,250
extremist watch running and going I'm

1170
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,630
going back to the concept of

1171
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,600
radicalization that's not how it works

1172
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:14,200
so something else I think is notable

1173
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:17,290
here is moving away from web 2.0 and

1174
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,549
going to the web 3.0 which is a legit

1175
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,850
time I said you know you can look around

1176
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:24,520
I said it's essentially where the

1177
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:26,618
services now I use feedback from your

1178
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,420
behavior to improve the quality of that

1179
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,550
service and we see the example with the

1180
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:33,369
YouTube recommendation algorithm here

1181
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,140
you hear has ended up at just a random

1182
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:36,640
video that like this is so weird that he

1183
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,779
didn't mean so like you like that - from

1184
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,770
like around like you just start watching

1185
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,810
something and then you just

1186
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,710
automatically just end up at some

1187
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,960
 weird right - because so

1188
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,280
obviously none of this is proven because

1189
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,420
YouTube is proprietary and when we don't

1190
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,420
know how the each of all of them works

1191
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:56,369
like it would make sense for it to be

1192
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:58,810
optimized on engagement and as we know

1193
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:00,710
violent extremism isn't all that popular

1194
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,640
but when the

1195
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,470
either they've gone yeah right that's

1196
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,770
like it's kind of assaulting something

1197
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:09,770
identity so ideally never ideally sorry

1198
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:11,270
you can imagine that these extremist

1199
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,460
videos and the things which would lend

1200
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:16,040
its themselves to extremism would have

1201
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:19,310
on paper quite good engagement stats and

1202
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:22,070
SSI led to a number of fingers like like

1203
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,700
setting up to you I'm gonna bet you I'm

1204
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:28,310
super sorry

1205
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:32,359
design it's good thanks essentially did

1206
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:34,580
a piece on the default pasted on the

1207
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:36,109
each of algorithm and then like follow

1208
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,910
the basic pattern if just like watching

1209
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:40,490
the news and only particular subjects

1210
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,740
and the content got more and more

1211
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:46,009
engaged as you go on suggesting that an

1212
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:48,680
increased engagement can actually lead

1213
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:51,410
the YouTube algorithm to suggest more of

1214
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,910
the same and if we accept that some

1215
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,200
people are being radicalized I'm not

1216
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,609
saying that everyone's being radicalized

1217
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,750
I'm not saying that every every YouTube

1218
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:58,910
creator is actually a secret Nazi

1219
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,920
hell-bent on inventing any of their ways

1220
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,540
not saying any that I don't have to what

1221
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,150
I'm saying is if they are being article

1222
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:07,270
eyes it makes sense that algorithms

1223
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,500
which are unchecked like this might

1224
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,450
amplify the effects of it right because

1225
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,920
I gets you know one even needs to send

1226
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,750
you right there like you like if you use

1227
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,190
your algorithms recommending it yourself

1228
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,510
and you're more likely to be referred to

1229
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:19,720
content which is more extreme than the

1230
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,560
content you've just watched that

1231
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,060
potentially can be a problem when it

1232
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:27,250
comes to addressing country and violent

1233
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:30,500
extremism not tended to send up a person

1234
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:32,390
recently especially with what's

1235
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,730
happening Christchurch and with I charm

1236
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:37,160
and once people people's eyes have been

1237
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,990
quite open to it recently there's this

1238
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,549
concept of the power of the pipeline of

1239
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:42,618
extremism or as it's commonly referred

1240
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,470
to the alt-right pipeline which suggests

1241
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:48,290
that there is a transition off ideas and

1242
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,180
off discussion which does lend itself to

1243
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:52,750
radicalization

1244
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,500
so essentially you start off with fringe

1245
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,940
nonviolent views and this can be

1246
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,210
anything from all in conservatism to

1247
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:01,339
libertarianism - I know identitarian as

1248
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,720
Miniver that means so going back to

1249
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:05,630
those push and pull factors they're

1250
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,520
present but not so bad to the point

1251
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,410
where he wants to join a violent

1252
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,880
extremist group

1253
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:15,058
and the game with or with algorithms

1254
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,289
suggesting new content that can I mean

1255
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,519
and there's a report that I'll mention

1256
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,930
in the next slide which goes into this

1257
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,788
more I appreciate this is a bit of a

1258
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:23,640
jump well let's say if there was

1259
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:28,349
extremist content on YouTube and you

1260
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:30,779
were to use YouTube often there is a

1261
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:34,200
chance that this algorithm could suggest

1262
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:37,890
you this extreme but not overtly

1263
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,210
extremely content and this is something

1264
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,430
that people have talked about and there

1265
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:44,269
are before obviously that the the

1266
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:46,470
research is pointing in so there's no

1267
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:47,700
there's no consensus because there's

1268
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:52,019
always been fences I wouldn't to do talk

1269
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:54,569
about it right so again the and then

1270
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:55,979
with the ease of access to spaces and

1271
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:57,869
yelling radicalization so that's an

1272
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,819
refers to the use of services like the

1273
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,440
scores in telegram and signal and

1274
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:02,910
whatsapp for the creation of private

1275
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,799
groups which we all don't have the

1276
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:06,808
pleasure of seeing what time contains

1277
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:08,640
from quite nasty stuff and because of

1278
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:10,049
like some other externalities that I've

1279
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,328
not went into at all like and and

1280
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,829
encryption and like one that people's

1281
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:15,599
right to privacy and also the stuff we

1282
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:17,309
can't monitor less stuff right so if

1283
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,829
we're ever to tackle radicalization it

1284
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:22,049
has to happen before the fact all right

1285
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:24,569
but there's this is really great report

1286
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:26,730
and it's one of the only ones I read in

1287
00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:28,710
this fall is huge it's a long long long

1288
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,599
thing but it's called alternative

1289
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:35,190
infants broadcasting the reactionary

1290
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:37,559
right on YouTube um yeah the next

1291
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,630
section is white kind of emerging

1292
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,180
technologies and so like that's kind of

1293
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:43,500
all I have to say about the this next

1294
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,710
centralized services six social media

1295
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,690
who's moving onwards what might be a

1296
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,579
problem in the future we're like these

1297
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:54,329
guys are very guys and girls are very

1298
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:55,680
good people are very good at helping up

1299
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:57,200
new technologies and seeing how you can

1300
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,180
benefit their

1301
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,129
let's see how you can benefit their

1302
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,578
ideology right so what's next

1303
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,970
and we've seen censorship resistant

1304
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:10,760
content listing up on the blockchain

1305
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:12,618
called alveoli stands from my brain it's

1306
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,200
a Content file hosting service that uses

1307
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:16,970
the coin but I'm going over the

1308
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,259
blockchain but it uses the coin here

1309
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,240
like you host it and then when someone

1310
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,710
wants to see more want you to serve it

1311
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,509
to them you just pay them about a lock

1312
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:26,539
point or they pay you a little point and

1313
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:29,059
it works but the thing is is that once

1314
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:32,180
you've bought it then it actually is

1315
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:33,910
like it shared amongst like it's it's

1316
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,589
it's essentially a peer-to-peer network

1317
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:38,750
which stores all the content on the

1318
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:40,910
blockchain so obviously to censor that

1319
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,390
or to modify the content on the actual

1320
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,098
ledger

1321
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,240
I would match everything up right it

1322
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,980
might destroy the tops of the whole

1323
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,750
thing and it wouldn't work so there's no

1324
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,819
way for you to edit or modify anything

1325
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,289
on it which is quite worrying when it

1326
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:52,700
comes to this because what if Isis take

1327
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:54,859
a bunch of videos and even the

1328
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,629
abominable project right it's like if it

1329
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:59,839
ever gains me an attraction we know that

1330
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:03,109
that's not going to happen so some of

1331
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:06,519
the things right and who here new has

1332
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:10,609
heard a mastodon who here is heard a gab

1333
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:13,220
we hear sort of gab almost at all hey so

1334
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:16,759
essentially gob is the free speech

1335
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:19,339
platform which this guy likes a lot and

1336
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:21,799
this he showed up a Senegal I think I

1337
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:22,819
have same story as the young

1338
00:52:21,799 --> 00:52:27,170
Christchurch shooter

1339
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:29,450
same type a guy same type of on central

1340
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:31,700
motivations and again we've got this

1341
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:34,220
time slayer of this i just refers to

1342
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,720
this kind of a like again crept in

1343
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,730
flashes and right when i KY say it's it

1344
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,049
doesn't look good at people of our

1345
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:42,230
movement we're going back in time and

1346
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:44,680
something i just want to go back to you

1347
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,680
can see

1348
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,980
so screw your optics

1349
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:58,808
I guess so like there's my slide with

1350
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,880
lobster we're go so I'm essentially

1351
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,140
mastodons is a design choice platform

1352
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,180
I'm not gonna go into how it works but

1353
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:09,490
it's like hard to like sensor things on

1354
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,990
the inositol network itself and out but

1355
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,729
what you say free speech platform which

1356
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:15,069
refuses to censor anything I'm only

1357
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:17,109
leagues like this you can go and look at

1358
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:19,420
all like all those other cycles it's all

1359
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:22,569
archived if you so want and if you do

1360
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:24,369
not believe that it is as insightful as

1361
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:26,650
s decided ban and the other God is bomb

1362
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:29,829
as well once they find out that they

1363
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:31,660
were both gab users after the fact of

1364
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:33,280
course because they can say they've done

1365
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,799
something that but essentially this is

1366
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,720
wonder if the massive and so yeah but

1367
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:39,250
another of I know a couple of platforms

1368
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,038
like this have actually faced opposition

1369
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:43,630
from the services in which they work so

1370
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:45,280
obviously if I want to run the social

1371
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,809
network I need hosting a payment

1372
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,339
providers any designers I need all this

1373
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:51,309
almost an infrastructure allowing me to

1374
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:53,799
support not mission and guards from

1375
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:55,569
having a few problems specifically we're

1376
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:57,460
finding a domain host I'm finding more

1377
00:53:55,569 --> 00:54:00,369
state but on master gone they've almost

1378
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:03,900
right so that's the idea so worth

1379
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:05,829
thinking about for what we do by that so

1380
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,170
coming to the end because we're five

1381
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:08,859
minutes left what the do we do what

1382
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,670
if Spencer

1383
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:13,960
like seriously because like like like

1384
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:15,940
very like we have to do something and I

1385
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,410
hope we can I hope they get again like

1386
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,809
if this is not a call for me to say

1387
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:21,160
that's criminalize speech because I like

1388
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:22,029
you're a computer security crawling

1389
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,009
you're probably wondering what the house

1390
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:26,079
is that is computer security conferences

1391
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:28,720
censorship this Pro censorship no

1392
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,640
instance right but essentially I don't

1393
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,200
think it even goes that far like

1394
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,750
everywhere at the stage where we were

1395
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,118
actively censoring people arm inward

1396
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,740
like crushing the same thing opinions

1397
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,260
then I would agree that we need to be

1398
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:44,459
cautious but as it sounds they we have

1399
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:46,050
not managed to crush any

1400
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,760
what's pharmacist moving like it's still

1401
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,050
there just as much as it was in the

1402
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,520
early and all these just as much as it

1403
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,470
was on BBS if not more

1404
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,800
and now we've got content which could

1405
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:58,020
amplify it at quite an alarming pace so

1406
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,790
for me I kind of just want us as

1407
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,820
technical as technology professionals

1408
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:04,020
here here works in the security industry

1409
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:08,580
like you raise your hand if you want to

1410
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:10,200
work in the studio that's like basically

1411
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,240
everyone right so Mike I mean we all

1412
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,439
like regardless whether we work for like

1413
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,029
runs we're consultants of our own

1414
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,430
project things were on something we all

1415
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:19,530
have I stick in the product ring but we

1416
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:22,140
all have a stake in which like in the

1417
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,330
business transactions which allow these

1418
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:26,220
guys to keep operating and I think like

1419
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:29,580
for us to have the KFOR could

1420
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:31,410
potentially be like like game-changing

1421
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,900
so I would like getting away from this

1422
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:35,970
like that's all you anything just like

1423
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,220
please think to yourself how can i Medi

1424
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:40,439
get on like essentially how can I stop

1425
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:43,140
if this beautiful thing I felt from

1426
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,370
being used by and if I may never the

1427
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,629
next for happier think of it as an

1428
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,819
attacker right it's anniversary

1429
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:50,970
simulation one of Nazi uses for like the

1430
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,560
likes of accents in your game so also

1431
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,089
more research needs to be done to

1432
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,190
clarify the link between the internet

1433
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,410
and extremism because like for someone

1434
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,880
and I believe for many in this room we

1435
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:03,569
can see it and we can see the kind of

1436
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:06,780
like the the speeding along the road

1437
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,490
erratically ization that it has but the

1438
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,210
the really like the research on it is

1439
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:13,379
obviously quite new in contemporary so

1440
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:17,370
more of that would be often everyone's

1441
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:19,440
looking for a dissertation project and I

1442
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:22,470
guess the question they call to action

1443
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,990
well I'm going to take you so I want to

1444
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:27,930
let it go with this what role do we want

1445
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:30,330
the service providers to have like what

1446
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,710
do we want Facebook to be able today if

1447
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,580
we want them to be able to censor space

1448
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:35,490
you want them you're going to chase

1449
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:38,819
what's in our season one isn't become we

1450
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:41,520
like and do that if we don't want it

1451
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,870
from we find directly is going to make

1452
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,180
that decision because someone needs to

1453
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:46,310
make the decision and like so far it's

1454
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,810
not like us

1455
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:51,080
like like we're not doing a ratings

1456
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:53,480
element so someone needs to and just

1457
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:57,650
reminder that inaction is still a

1458
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:00,560
decision so yeah like that's kind of it

1459
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:02,330
um well I just want to reiterate the

1460
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,040
presidency some prayers I do not want

1461
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:07,040
classify speech and you not want to lock

1462
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:08,509
this all up for wrong thing is really

1463
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,430
isn't something we should rush I just

1464
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:12,380
think we should have the conversation

1465
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:15,169
and we're in the position to make a real

1466
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:18,229
difference so that's not this up

1467
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,229
