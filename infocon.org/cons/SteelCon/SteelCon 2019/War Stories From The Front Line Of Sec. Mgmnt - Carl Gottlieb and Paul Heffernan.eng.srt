difficult job of security management in

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,700

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,260
time at the end for questions I wait to

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,360
ask questions now and all the way

29
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,059
through the thing you're probably

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,459
thinking somebody else wants to ask well

31
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,250
quite a bit in here so please just shout

32

34
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,979
some questions and get things going for

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,869

36
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,548
want to make a statement great do it

37
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:25,920
after the presentation please questions

38
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:28,259
only no statements okay so who are we

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,700
well I'm Paul I'm currently the chief

40
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,100
information security officer of

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,460
revolutes so if ever mando card please

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,530
leave now I've really chief information

43
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,119
security officer for a few years now in

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,429
different companies have also worked in

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,899
consulting my background is as a Penn

46
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,810
sester so I very much come from a

47
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,399
technical world and maybe maybe right

48
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,299
wrong decision to move into management

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,639
and I'm Kyle Gottlieb I work on Sky News

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,770
as you can see and also Paul this

51
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:58,289
politely chosen the photo of me where

52
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,179
I'm quite fat which is very kind in

53
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,310
there my role is a date objection

54
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,560
officer which basically means I do a bit

55
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,700
of legal privacy stuff and say the word

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,700
maybe a lot

57
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,109
so we thought we'd start our talk by

58
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,940
just giving a brief outline but like a

59
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,220
difference and what you know what is a

60
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,750
Caesar and what is a dpi because I think

61
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,540
some people may have come across these

62
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,459
roles in their job I mean you work for C

63
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,260
so walking there at pentester probably

64
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,360
provide reports that see toes read or

65
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,980
don't read so we thought we just spend a

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
couple of minutes just talking about the

67
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,738
purpose of those two they're designed to

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,010
do and if this video please see if it

69
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:40,440
brings

70
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:43,120
know if we had an ear open anyway anyway

71
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,010
purpose of a Caesar most organizations

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,280
is usually the most accountable person

73
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,299
inside the organization security so they

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,250
like to think they are they're not

75
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,470
always necessarily they're often

76
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,090
outvoted by other board members or other

77
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,750
you know senior management and we'll

78
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,040
discuss shortly why that happens but

79
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,870
it's an interesting role because it's

80
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,850
one of the few roles that has chief in

81
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,680
the name but very rarely actually sees

82
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,069
in the top board of an organization like

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,230
the CEO CFO and other c-level Rob so it

84
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,480
can be quite an interesting role to have

85
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,429
an interesting title because the title

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,140
suggests you have a lot of management

87
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,269
responsibilities and a lot of power but

88
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,529
often that's a small C that comes with

89
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,660
the title and we'll discuss some of the

90
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,400
issues that that creates but it can

91
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,880
often lead to interesting conversations

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,530
with board members questions like this

93
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,570
calculus is not an example of a complex

94
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,980
password just because this typical word

95
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,190
does not mean it's a good password

96
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,609
choice it can often lead to discussions

97
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,650
like this

98
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,959
unfortunately no our mobile will not

99
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,150
help us when you lose your laptop and

100
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,120
sometimes when we do have the odd

101
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,320
incident no we cannot hack them back so

102
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,280
that's the role of the Caesar

103
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:55,380
so DPO is quite different to a C so

104
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,380
because it's cooler it's person so

105
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,680
nice - anything like yeah let me see

106
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,010
some wannabe seaside gdpr came along

107
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:09,410
now I'm the daddy so I'm smoking off the

108
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:11,149
BA and yeah Marya and DC Facebook was 5

109
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:16,190
billion that the FTC confirmed that

110
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,560
Facebook line is so quite a lot so yes a

111
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:22,010
deep deep here's a cooler but you also

112
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,650
may know me of such hits as no I can't

113
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,409
lead a job I'd say to keep it but also

114
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,780
more importantly you can do that but you

115
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,810
might go to prison so I'm all about the

116
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,510
pros and the cons that same time really

117
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:38,230
so the kind of where I focus is things

118
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,930
like the current world of privacy so

119
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,730
Facebook Facebook is a great example of

120
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,530
kind of privacy and they've got all your

121
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:49,070
data and they look after it really well

122
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,000
and Facebook would never get fine apart

123
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,950
from the five billion thing I just

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,800
mentioned but Facebook pocket change

125
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,260
yeah it's just pocket change for them so

126
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,520
yeah when are we talking about my wall

127
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,430
port role and how they kind of interject

128
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:06,289
and work together

129
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:08,510
so security blame let's discuss you know

130
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,490
it's particularly for our roles a lot of

131
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,590
security comes down to blame with other

132
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,420
parts of the organization why is it we

133
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,190
can't do this thing that we'd like to do

134
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,040
well you know it's a really bad idea and

135
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,080
his wife and this often is to do the

136
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,370
facts and this is kind of a key topic

137
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,190
going to focus on at this stage

138
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,050
accountability our roles in our

139
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,030
organizations are generally to be the

140
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,100
accountable person for security or

141
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,140
privacy and sometimes we don't want that

142
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,480
accountability because it comes with a

143
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,159
great deal of responsibility but often

144
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,660
we are the person in the organization

145
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,900
who is at that moment in time most

146
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,390
accountable for security or privacy but

147
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,000
really where does accountability lie

148
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,539
when gets real well we should ask

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,650
this lady

150
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:53,180
anybody know who she is yes correct Dido

151
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,979
Harlan X Tok Tok

152
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,160
CEO if she looks a bit like Harry Potter

153
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,290
he does yeah anyway this was her on BBC

154
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,700
News that's the face CEOs never want to

155
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,710
happen that's the whole reason they

156
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,710
employee you know see those and dpo is

157
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,450
it's because they never want to be done

158
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,909
on the 10 o'clock news explaining why

159
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,200
TalkTalk may or may not have encrypted

160
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,120
his personal data and could have

161
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,159
possibly suffered a sequential attack

162
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,630
which was very interesting this notion

163
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,610
because it led to the whole security

164
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,650
industry trying to figure out what the

165
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:27,850
sequential attack was when Shaq he meant

166
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:30,159
a sequel attack exactly you know is it

167
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,810
is it like an advanced attack I think

168
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,930
it's an advanced persistent a I say

169
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,250
rightfully so no CEO wants to be Dino

170
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,560
hard on the 10 o'clock news and that's

171
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,810
the whole reason they often employ roles

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,610
like minicars to protect themselves from

173
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,440
this situation ever happening which

174
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,510
leads to many of those discussions and

175
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,370
no we can't hack back and this is a bad

176
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,050
password and no this won't protect you

177
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,750
when you use the lose your current

178
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,490
laptop we're really there to just save

179
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,440
these people from ever going you know

180
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,470
having having the picture like this on

181
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,510
BBC news all indeed facing a large fine

182
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,120
or indeed potentially going to prison

183
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,650
because CEOs are officers of a company

184
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,930
so they aren't ultimately fully

185
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,179
accountable for comes actions and so

186
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,280
there's often a lot of debate with sees

187
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,410
those and dpo so can we be fired for not

188
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,989
being our job the answer is possibly

189
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,960
these the people who really will suffer

190
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,990
working so the kind of things we have to

191
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,460
deal in daily basis are weird especially

192
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,040
my job we have to deal with quite

193
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,250
strange scenarios and the kind of thing

194
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,730
I often get is this thing of like thanks

195
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:37,440
Karl but kind of know and scenario I had

196
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:40,420
that like your kind of feedback on as I

197
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,800
start working for a company and look to

198
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,510
what they would do with marketing data

199
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,450
and so on and I can sat down with the

200
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,640
CEO and a few other people and said what

201
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:53,289
we're doing is making us money but it's

202
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:56,440
illegal okay so you know pros and cons

203
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,290
and everything so I advise on a stop

204
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,860
legal level we should stop doing that

205
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,889
and then he's saying it's legal yeah in

206
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,650
your opinion car

207
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:10,319
yes in my opinion but is it absolutely

208
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,299
illegal in my opinion is yes in your

209
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,400
opinion look what else can I give you

210
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,080
what will speak to our lawyers there and

211
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,340
then they spoke to the lawyers and

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,060
lawyer said yeah comes right out

213
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:26,369
but then the CEO said in your opinion

214
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,360
this is a legal opinion and which Oxley

215
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,719
carries more weight and makes I'm not a

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,190
lawyer but in the end they kind of

217
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,208
ignored it and then three months later

218
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,430
we got sued for what we were doing now

219
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:40,078
what's kind of interesting is a lot of

220
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,468
people here instantly would say like

221
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:45,989
okay well someone screwed up there but

222
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,570
the question is who screwed up was it

223
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,209
CEO for being better deck or was it me

224
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,850
for not building a business case

225
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,189
successfully enough because arguably I

226
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,470
should have as a senior person been able

227
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,560
to convince him how to do his job and

228
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,269
take the proper advice so again it's

229
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,939
blame thing Paul's talking about it's

230
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:07,290
hard to know which is which so bit of

231
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,920
question for you all and you've all got

232
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,380
keypads

233
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,079
which all work if you think I was to

234
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,939
blame could you press one if you think

235
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,890
the CEO is to blame could you press two

236
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:23,430
and if you think we're both to blame

237
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:26,329
keep s three and if you think anyways

238
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,329
keep us actually work

239
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:46,160
a lot of this comes down to the fact

240
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:48,019
that people are jobs is communication

241
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,360
you're just technically good at your job

242
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,010
it's not good enough our you know this

243
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,930
industry trades on technical knowledge

244
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,910
for a lot of our job our currency with

245
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,069
people is I'm technically great at the

246
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,199
job that I do if you can't communicate

247
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,579
that to anybody then you're never really

248
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,310
going to get them to buy into the stuff

249
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,989
that you're doing so in our case you

250
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,910
know a major part of our role indeed

251
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,529
probably why we've moved more away from

252
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,240
a technical background now is because

253
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,500
the bulk of our job is about talking to

254
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,269
people and persuading them and

255
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,130
influencing and all the softer stuff

256
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,110
that you could probably put into people

257
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,000
you know people hacking category but

258
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,160
it's really really important and I think

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,420
that's probably why you know a lot of us

260
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,920
have gone through things I can cause the

261
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,510
syndrome early on in our technical

262
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,800
careers the great thing about going into

263
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,910
management if you don't really suffer

264
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,079
from anymore can you just talking

265
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:36,709
 so-so

266
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,449
yeah absolutely where is this nurhachi

267
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,829
don't stuff from imposter syndrome is

268
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,500
they know how bad everyone is at that

269
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:44,000
job and once you kind of get that wisdom

270
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,310
and you kind of realized God everybody

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,350
 then you realize actually I'm not

272
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,339
bad myself

273
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,399
so we've talked about accountability

274
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,260
which is one of the most sexy words out

275
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,390
there early but let's talk about

276
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,490
something even better at risk management

277
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,829
now I shouldn't worry if anyone that's

278
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,050
the CISSP in the room not sis for proof

279
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,250
content yeah its slot goes slightly off

280
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,660
track from that but I know you're

281
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:12,829
thinking like countability

282
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:16,699
dull risk management it's some sexy

283
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:17,779
stuff so some of you are wearing that I

284
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,459
mean them know about risk management

285
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,370
others is it going to be kind of new to

286
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,750
you so there's this concept called the

287
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,880
forties of risk management and

288
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,980
essentially for any kind of risk

289
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,410
there should be four ways four options

290
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,300
are dealing with those risks so I'll

291
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,760
start with T those are the kind of

292
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,569
explanations for them so anyone want to

293
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,569
shout out one of the T's they know

294
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,839
transfer it yep absolutely another one

295
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,709
yep

296
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,709
third one

297
00:11:46,680 --> 00:12:01,500
take tolerate terminate yep Tim makes

298
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,500
one and third one is the top right one

299
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:17,200
transfer is absolutely right answer so

300
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:21,849
these are the four T's now in our world

301
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,760
EPMC so you also see a 50 which is a

302
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,640
canoe one and the 50 describes the kind

303
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,250
of scenario or the person that takes a

304
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:38,620
risk and just denies it just says now

305
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:48,339
they don't guess what that tears it

306
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:50,079
actually stands for this actually is

307
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,820
very serious thing apply to putting off

308
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,609
another day but this is a kind of

309
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,140
reality people say but now I get the

310
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,360
whole premise of what you're trying to

311
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,010
say I just don't agree with it we're

312
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,240
just not going to even consider this I'm

313
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,760
not going to try and treat it tolerates

314
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,560
it terminated whatever that is how it is

315
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,149
and essentially you end up with this

316
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,069
kind of brick wall feeling

317
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,470
I mean you genuinely feel like this in

318
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,760
those meetings of I just can't get

319
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,680
through to you and this was happening

320
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,149
that CEO meeting where he just said in

321
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,120
your opinion in your opinion and you

322
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,040
just kind of stuck and ultimately you

323
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,310
become the person that's getting the way

324
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,550
of the business and this is kind of the

325
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:30,459
interaction I have all the time is yeah

326
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,620
I don't care you should I don't care

327
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:34,839
well it's really good articulate

328
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,620
business case of why you should know I

329
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,230
don't care up Karl so and what's

330
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,329
going on there is we're just completely

331
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,149
misaligned like two trains and different

332
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,430
tracks and the only way to kind of

333
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:49,990
bridge that is to get on their track and

334
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,589
it comes down to what people actually

335
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,779
want now here's an example of what's our

336
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:58,329
seven different roles and what they

337
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:59,589
commonly want now notice none of them

338
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,229
have got anything to do with I see

339
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,990
security

340
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,260
but CEOs these days especially startups

341
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,300
it's gross profit don't care risk often

342
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,840
don't care it's as accelerating growth

343
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,880
and the question is can you get on that

344
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,890
track can you say how you and your

345
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,160
problem your vulnerability what you care

346
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,710
about relates to them not the business

347
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,439
what they specifically want I mean

348
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:27,740
you'll find people that their only focus

349
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,850
is getting off at 5:29 every day like

350
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,100
they will not want to leave the office

351
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,530
up at that point if you can somehow make

352
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,090
it they do that you'll help them out and

353
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,630
a pen tester is a great example of it

354
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:41,240
where pen testers often get bought their

355
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,340
services from project managers just to

356
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,080
take a box and many pen testers in this

357
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,780
room hey that because you all got pride

358
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,670
the other half of you will say well that

359
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,060
just give me three grounds take a box I

360
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,199
will take that box gladly and ultimately

361
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,849
if you can help that project manager

362
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,470
they'll keep coming back so sometimes

363
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,410
it's about aligning to those people

364
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:05,780
precisely now a lot of you will be

365
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:07,910
thinking this so you'll be saying lovely

366
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,740
Karl but you're being idiot

367
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,510
because I've got pride and I don't align

368
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,570
with marketing manager and everything

369
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:18,110
but ultimately that's how you can make

370
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,460
that leap forward so how do you actually

371
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,260
break through is pretty cool we've

372
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,970
discussed some of the issues with you

373
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,740
know not being able to communicate to

374
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,030
people and getting them sand binds what

375
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,830
we try to do what are the kind of top

376
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,810
tips from outside to break down that

377
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,700
wall so the first is you have to get

378
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,109
really good at sales salespeople are

379
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,780
great talking become

380
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,210
salespeople the first thing is humans

381
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,890
don't make decisions you know well sorry

382
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,170
humans make decisions not companies so

383
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,699
most people you know they're going to be

384
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,860
making decisions and variety of factors

385
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,110
it won't be obvious to you so the CEO

386
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,700
you know the CEOs decision for what they

387
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,410
want to do could be wildly different it

388
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,450
could be make profit could be grow it

389
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,770
could be expand into other countries it

390
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,720
could be all manner of different things

391
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,480
if the really understand what it is that

392
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,610
they want to do secondly accept the

393
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,680
world how it is I think when I joined

394
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,260
the security industry I felt a bit like

395
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,030
you know I'm gonna I'm going to secure

396
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,760
the world hack everything is secure the

397
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,040
world

398
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,480
the reality is it's really difficult to

399
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,360
do that because you've got all of this

400
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,680
you know independence in what you know

401
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,240
people want to do and people have got

402
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,219
their own spin on things so you have to

403
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,560
accept a little bit the way things are

404
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,470
and the way people are and change your

405
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,510
approach accordingly thirdly ask people

406
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,980
what they actually care about spend time

407
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,480
with people in different functions so

408
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,040
you know I've sat with people in

409
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,200
marketing I've stuck with people in HR

410
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,579
for the holiday just to figure out why

411
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,440
it is they do what they do and often

412
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,600
walk back with more questions and

413
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
answers but anyway spending time with

414
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,330
people is the best way to really

415
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,370
understand what it is they want to do

416
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,710
and figure out how you get security into

417
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,840
their process or their areas just on

418
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,430
that note about asking people it sounds

419
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,350
kind of weird but I just showed a slide

420
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,050
where I said like CEO growth or whatever

421
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,070
but you actually have to ask people and

422
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,709
it's a really simple question

423
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,540
when you say to like a customer or I say

424
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,270
to a colleague of like what you actually

425
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,609
want what would help you and the answer

426
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,520
is rarely rarely what you think it will

427
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:12,869
be I used to do a lot of sales and I

428
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,190
went in to HMRC the UK tax authority and

429
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,989
so I was trying to sell them some

430
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,880
anti-ddos solutions like to stop that

431
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,949
website going down there on my busiest

432
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,449
day of the year January 31st there are

433
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,550
massive peak of traffic I was trying to

434
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,900
protect them I said you don't want to go

435
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,520
down he's sure that you care about

436
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,310
availability we the important part

437
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,960
security and they went no we don't care

438
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,870
if it goes down and we don't need to buy

439
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,430
your stuff right well surely you do

440
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,389
because take how much money you lose and

441
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,550
said well Carl we'll lose nothing

442
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,410
because you can't pay your tax anywhere

443
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:44,190
else we'll just wait till it comes back

444
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:46,130
up and it sounds kind of stupid but some

445
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,180
like BBC is another example

446
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,640
confidentiality oh yeah BBC should

447
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,660
really care about that well BBC as soon

448
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,870
as they get information they make your

449
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,630
public it's their job yeah it's a job to

450
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,310
make to breach their data so what you

451
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,530
necessarily might think everyone has the

452
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,440
same you think every marketing manager

453
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,730
is the same they're not just asked from

454
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,800
there you can go straight to the heart

455
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,480
what they personally want and that's

456
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,700
really the final point sell based on

457
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,130
their motivations if it is growth if it

458
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,660
is not availability then figure out how

459
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,820
you actually get security into that

460
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,500
conversation and use that as the channel

461
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,899
in to make influence and that's that's

462
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,250
really that you know the four main way

463
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,380
to get good influence from a security

464
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,720
perspective but we thought we'd take you

465
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,390
on a short tour of some other tips of

466
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,670
things that would work for us as well so

467
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,530
the next area really is making sure that

468
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,210
you keep your enemies close because

469
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,010
that's a Caesar and a DP oh you will

470
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,130
often have people causing lots of

471
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,270
problems often unintentionally but you

472
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,500
know whether they're developers or

473
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,120
marketing people they'll often do

474
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,680
something that just messes up security

475
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,540
and they didn't even know that you work

476
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,330
there and you know it's not my fault I'm

477
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,590
just trying to do my job

478
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,389
they're not really an enemy they're just

479
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,159
working in the same organization you've

480
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,250
got to figure out how you make sure that

481
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,390
you make security easy for them so they

482
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,130
don't have to come to work and put their

483
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,380
security hat on it just becomes a

484
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,270
natural part of the way they work so

485
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,710
what is your adversary in the modern day

486
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,740
of security management actually look

487
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,480
like so the first area is Fox you know

488
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,580
that's actually what back that's why it

489
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,520
wouldn't really live out there on the

490
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,710
solution buy it in Russia oh yeah so

491
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,760
you'll often have discussion with senior

492
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,030
management they'll say right how many

493
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,500
times were being hacked today why does

494
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,639
that happen well it matters because I

495
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,960
want to feel good that the money I'm

496
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,150
just giving you separate company has

497
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,670
gone some are useful and often a large

498
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,160
you know part of that data is just

499
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,170
describing how some Chinese bots they

500
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,550
were all scanning us this probably you

501
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,260
know some dates that we can make you

502
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,090
feel good about so that's that's one

503
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,480
area the second area of course

504
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,209
pentesters you know like into liking to

505
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,380
disrupt systems often you know getting

506
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,910
you know as a security manager of seizo

507
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,950
often some blame from pentoses that the

508
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,770
scope is not realistic or it's a pen

509
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,540
test and not a red team and so there's

510
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,760
often this discussion with senior

511
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,730
management about having pen tests done

512
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,620
to tick the box and often that leads the

513
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,390
CSO to be put in a difficult position

514
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,429
because they know that they really do

515
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,560
need to have a proper you know red team

516
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,270
exercise done but they only have a very

517
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,100
short window to have the testing done or

518
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,480
it needs to be tied into a project and

519
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,659
the project manager is making sure that

520
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,280
box gets ticked this is a difficult job

521
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,370
working with pen testers and making sure

522
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,930
the test is fair then of course mobile

523
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,209
threats the hacker pulling out the

524
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,490
tablet as is the case of the modern hack

525
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,030
today

526
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,920
I think we've all seen that yeah yeah so

527
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,570
people using their personal devices to

528
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,750
access work email and wondering why

529
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:44,060
they've suddenly got you know some home

530
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,920
on their device which year would links

531
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,750
they're working I wasn't me you know it

532
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,220
was just this device that I bought off

533
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,100
eBay you know not my fault

534
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,450
of course nation states this off the

535
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,399
leaders of this country with the board

536
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,170
about so I've know we've noticed that

537
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,330
China is doing a lot of attacks on its

538
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,400
first leave their things and secondly no

539
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,790
we cannot hack them back so that often

540
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,820
leads to an interesting conversation

541
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:09,170
then of course script kiddies you know

542
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,169
often discussed in the security industry

543
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,750
but really you know just create noise

544
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,710
for security management don't really you

545
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,270
know there's not really much you have to

546
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:21,590
do to stop them any experience from your

547
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:23,660
sankar yeah I mean I mean this this

548
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,490
slide specifically is all about

549
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,590
transition of don't be one with the

550
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,490
other I think this is from the NSA it

551
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:33,830
was you know one of those well yeah what

552
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,660
do you see things about that is we in

553
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,480
our interview we have a huge disrespect

554
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:42,260
for script kiddies but we probably all

555
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,120
were one at some point so yeah have a

556
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:50,900
little bit of empathy on that movie and

557
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:52,969
then of course bounty hunters we do we

558
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,470
operate at a public book bounty but off

559
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,670
then you get relation I've got some

560
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,860
really good relationship with some

561
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,660
fantastic book bounty hunters but you do

562
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,020
get some people who do just purely for

563
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,060
the money

564
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,950
and then often circuit describe the

565
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,270
problem well you have to pay me

566
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,040
something first what probably in the

567
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,230
know is worth paying trust me trust me

568
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,030
it's fine and then you do eventually pay

569
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,470
them something and I can't I can't give

570
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,690
you a solution you've a pay extra go out

571
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,000
so there's often a big challenge in the

572
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,550
security industry about making sure bug

573
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,020
bounties are worthwhile and there's a

574
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,580
lot of debate that happens in management

575
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,230
conferences of the minute about what

576
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,060
bounties and whether they're relevant

577
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,370
and some of the discussion is how do we

578
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,470
pay these people because many Caesars

579
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,510
are having to take I've asked the rest

580
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,360
of IT for money out of their budget to

581
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,700
pay for bug bounties so it's your fault

582
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,199
if we can't buy more keyboards because

583
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,770
you're asking for all this money for bug

584
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,770
bomb support

585
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,230
then of course family members

586
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,730
I've had many incidents with family

587
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,409
members who brought in you know they

588
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,150
brought in their work laptop and said I

589
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:54,700
you know there's this weird screensaver

590
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,950
keeps coming up and definitely you know

591
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,320
it's no it wasn't me you know I wasn't

592
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,210
downloading Torrance I gave you another

593
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,770
view me and you know now it's just pull

594
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,980
up you know ransomware in this thing

595
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:08,470
keeps popping up amazing how badly you

596
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,270
know a modern laptop with all kinds of

597
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,610
you know protection can be quickly

598
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,220
undone by four-year-old that anyway and

599
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:19,389
as a DPO have to deal with more internal

600
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,950
threats so the how many people at first

601
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,080
suddenly seen a WordPress website just

602
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,830
spin up or found out like three months

603
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,870
after the fact

604
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,309
yeah those kind of things oh yeah we

605
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,020
keep all the data anything really safe

606
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,720
place in a drawer all those kind of

607
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,690
things so your marketing is a big one

608
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,250
that I exert work with a lot sales

609
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,250
people are another one that I

610
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,720
I mean we've all seen salespeople

611
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:50,420
snorting cocaine down my seven ways like

612
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,610
when you work you can play much every

613
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:58,070
day yeah everywhere you go is like fret

614
00:23:52,610 --> 00:24:00,110
cocaine demos and the pain of probably

615
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,450
half our lives how people here's lives

616
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,949
project managers are the kind of weird

617
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,510
demands they have but hey they love a

618
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,060
post-it note so they can organize things

619
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:10,160
a massive throughout we have right now

620
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,679
is developers and all crazy look cool

621
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,560
things they like to do hey I've just

622
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,310
done this it's live it's a it's agile

623
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,540
whatever and we can fix it in a sprint

624
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,190
what I even mean

625
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,020
are you gonna fix it now no fix in the

626
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,050
spray or I can fix you have to leave me

627
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,870
a ticket first yeah exactly

628
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,730
other issue we have often with data is

629
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,250
around levers so people just like

630
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,050
walking out building with stir and then

631
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,550
kind of once they've kind of gone you

632
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,220
know and they become an ex-employee

633
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,480
that's when those people like it's

634
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,490
amazing how many threats come out after

635
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,950
the fact how many people certainly that

636
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,380
passwords still works after that very

637
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,390
long period of time but there's also the

638
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,610
kind of unexpected threats the ones that

639
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,160
you would not expect to be coming at you

640
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,320
we see those all the time but one of the

641
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,360
biggest threats we don't really think

642
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,310
about very much especially from security

643
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,740
and privacy perspective it's just

644
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:08,690
general incompetence and some people

645
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,700
that you just can't train I mean you can

646
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,380
try but if they were sober then you

647
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,900
might have a chance but you know some of

648
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,510
these things kind of work against you so

649
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,340
ultimately we have to kind of have a bit

650
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,950
of group hug with these internal people

651
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,659
even these external people and be one of

652
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:26,030
these kind of lovely stock photo happy

653
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,980
families of like hey look at this isn't

654
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,870
it great so you can see I'm sat here

655
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,170
with marketing with snapping with sales

656
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,219
you know doughnuts off to the side and

657
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,650
were looking at this going isn't this

658
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:40,130
amazing or less will work together but

659
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:42,560
the idea really is to kind of hug your

660
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,050
adversary go and I mean worth tricks I

661
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,860
do is know the most dangerous people in

662
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:51,990
my organization maybe usually marketing

663
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,520
maybe sales support usually pretty good

664
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,780
I'm just going to sit with them so if

665
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,180
you're working in office and you can

666
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,389
just try and go and sit with marketing

667
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,830
for like a month and basically what

668
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,050
happens is you get to all the

669
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,169
conversations you find out about after a

670
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:09,870
breach because they'll just do supply oh

671
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,100
we can get we get a credit card so you

672
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:14,760
can buy this WordPress website and

673
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,620
you're like well we do want now are we

674
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,870
and then your WordPress website

675
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,479
co-signed it off now I'm thinking how

676
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,949
it's not going to win that one so all

677
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,110
right let's get Paul in let's try and

678
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,300
secure it so if you can get inside the

679
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,969
threat inside the bursaries and a great

680
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,190
example with bug bounty people is as a

681
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,770
DP oh what I want things I've done is

682
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,400
get out there and make it known who I

683
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,680
work for

684
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,030
so when bad things do happen they'll

685
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,620
kind of throw me up or tweet me and

686
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:45,000
decide hey Carl come ever chat rather

687
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:47,250
than a threat or a demand for money and

688
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,760
this actually happened with one person

689
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,590
in this room who all of you probably

690
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,390
heard gdpr some you may it not but

691
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,129
essentially gdpr is this European

692
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,780
regulation that says you've got to do

693
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,190
managed to breach notifications you got

694
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,940
to tell the regulator Summerwind bad

695
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:05,700
happens and it came live on 25th of may

696
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,680
2018 and on that day I happen to be in

697
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,320
the middle of America and a taxi going

698
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,060
by across some stay I've basically done

699
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,830
on my GTR preparation work I was I'm a

700
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,280
nice quiet day I thought nothing's gonna

701
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,449
happen

702
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:22,620
I get tweet at 9:05 on that day first

703
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:26,880
day GDP are being live saying hi Carl do

704
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:30,750
you work for this company yes just

705
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,090
really obscure company why I think I

706
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,740
might have found something and I know

707
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,570
this person it's a really good book

708
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,630
balance I said I can't shut us up at

709
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,830
that point and I mean I'm not gonna be

710
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,720
in and out of reception in this

711
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,100
countryside of this state and like told

712
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,730
me what's going on what's going on fala

713
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,800
vulnerability and basically he told me

714
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,810
the vulnerability straight away I got a

715
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,570
phone to IT manager we patched it almost

716
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:56,580
instantly and I really could chat with

717
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,110
this person it was all done really

718
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,850
friendly it wasn't really that lker

719
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,320
breach because it was not high risk or

720
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,070
anything like that just a blunder let's

721
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,168
see I

722
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,730
on the phone to HR we got some swag sent

723
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:08,620
out this person and it was all kind of

724
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,019
done within an hour and that was all

725
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,699
because he knew who I work for

726
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:14,110
and it was that relationship that he

727
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,159
could have been spread out over days and

728
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,639
everything it would have been quite bad

729
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:22,090
otherwise however the bit why we kind of

730
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:23,979
 up is when the swag arrives a few

731
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,189
weeks later I get another tweet from

732
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:30,250
this guy saying hi Karl ups have just

733
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:35,289
arrived and asked for 40 quid in customs

734
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:37,419
money now again whose fault was that

735
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:38,620
arguably it should have it is probably

736
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:40,570
mine because I should have told this

737
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,279
person can you just check we paid the

738
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,279
customs charges before we have to send

739
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:47,679
it over so again stay close to the

740
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,419
people you think will up whether it

741
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,980
be your interval people whether it be

742
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:54,610
the adversity in the bloodbath sponsor

743
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,720
stay close and gonna be friends so we

744
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,610
thought we'd just talk a moment about

745
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,230
the disconnect but often happens between

746
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,879
IT security and the rest of the business

747
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,320
and many people have probably recognized

748
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:04,689
the simpsons episode this comes from

749
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,418
where home decides to build the most

750
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,799
amazing car ever and it's got everything

751
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:11,049
you know all the mod cons it's like a

752
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,789
rolls-royce engine it's got you know two

753
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:15,039
little pods everything except it's a

754
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:17,110
shake-up so that's often what happens

755
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,730
with the organisation when it comes to

756
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,350
security so many people have got

757
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,659
conflicting requirements and when it

758
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,668
comes together it's just a show so

759
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:26,710
that that's you know really what we're

760
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,750
trying to do have security professionals

761
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,879
is try and line people up that's the I

762
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,950
think the core aspects of this role is

763
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:34,389
listening to people often helping other

764
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,580
teams out you've got nothing to do with

765
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:38,469
security and just relaying and helping

766
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,699
the organisation communicate and that I

767
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,289
think's when the magic happens when you

768
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,450
do a good job of that and helping people

769
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:46,419
line up and get all the requirements

770
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,740
together for a particular project then

771
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,629
you can have some really good influence

772
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,929
from a security perspective here's an

773
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:53,469
example of how it can go wrong so simple

774
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:55,659
question

775
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,279
I'll come into organizations and you

776
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:58,389
know that bad things happen or good

777
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,669
things up and I'm just doing an order

778
00:29:58,389 --> 00:30:02,879
like simple question do you have logging

779
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:05,800
enable and usually get the response of

780
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:08,139
yes we have a login

781
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,570
all right no let me we stay that do you

782
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,100
have logging enabled yes we have a

783
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,490
logging Carl it's just Nestle register

784
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,040
button so the other one sir we sometimes

785
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,420
get is this one oh yeah of course we

786
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,310
bought a Splunk but everything logging

787
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,040
to it who's got access oil including

788
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:28,570
load two reports never thing so we're

789
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:31,030
locking passwords oh and Twitter

790
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,740
had this a lot of people have this if

791
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,629
you work in an organization that can

792
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,540
check on this you will have this too

793
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:40,240
everyone has this normally checks so

794
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,790
please when you go back to your office

795
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,530
just go and look in your logging

796
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,260
software for things like the word

797
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:49,930
password or password equals quotes or

798
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:56,970
whatever you will find stuff because

799
00:30:49,930 --> 00:31:00,460
it's just there now stuff does happen

800
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:02,080
why am i stopping swearing now it's the

801
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,720
stuff that's happen and one of the

802
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,120
examples that I had fairly recently is

803
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,100
and this has been names changed for the

804
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,169
innocent and legal reasons yeah legal

805
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,110
reasons are not long enough thing is I

806
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,760
was working with this company and the

807
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:18,399
CEO is it's like a billion dollar

808
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,120
companies are quite big one and I get an

809
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,670
email from a CEO now the CEO never

810
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,139
emails me I'm a consultant consultants

811
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,220
don't ever really want to be email by CX

812
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,050
normally means something really Bad's

813
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,630
happened and the subject line was the

814
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:34,060
word expense now if your consultant that

815
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,560
strikes a theory da if you see the word

816
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,060
expense you never want to see that

817
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,350
because it's usually a bad thing it's

818
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,050
not a card you want to claim more

819
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,139
expenses

820
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:45,870
wouldn't that be good you're not

821
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,900
claiming enough so so I got this email

822
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,330
so instantly and my phone opened it up

823
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,140
and had a look email from from the CEO

824
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:57,149
and here's what it said

825
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,730
now first thing say is a CEO of John

826
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,830
Taylor it's not from infra tea builders

827
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,410
dotnet which happens to be a Pakistani

828
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:07,050
hosting company so in say I'm slightly

829
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:10,980
dubious of what's going on right now but

830
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,600
I actually I missed that far apart as

831
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,090
star and just went straight to leaking a

832
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,919
body a bit and like oh something's going

833
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,919
on needs me but then I realized hey this

834
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,300
science look a little bit fishy so I

835
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,290
should really delete this kind of job

836
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:28,590
you all get these all the time but just

837
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:32,129
kind of fancy seeing where it go so it's

838
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:34,649
like I thought I'd reply and be helpful

839
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,750
you know so I applied back so how can I

840
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,010
help and I thinking this is this

841
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,990
probably boss it's not really going to

842
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,180
go anyway it's not kind of scripted

843
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:45,360
right I said nothing really happened and

844
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:53,700
then it did we had a reply and this is

845
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:55,469
the reply you know the surprise google

846
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,630
play about to do by everybody as a CEO

847
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,250
yeah we're doesn't I mean we all have

848
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,460
those so Google Play vouchers from our

849
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,290
from our bosses haven't way so and

850
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,630
nothing sounds fishy at all in this does

851
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:09,930
it about going to my local store and

852
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:13,730
buying these and taking pictures this

853
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:17,030
little sound a little bit weird but

854
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,030
let's reply

855
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,710
let's see whether we can fight this

856
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,360
because I think they are I couldn't be

857
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,130
bothered leaving our face but I do have

858
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,310
some magical dark blockchain pouches

859
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:34,340
which I've just invented so yeah I will

860
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:36,470
happily email those to you and I thought

861
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,879
there's no way no way they'll apply to

862
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,290
that because it's a scripted bar and

863
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,380
it'll kind of fail and everything and

864
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:45,440
you see what pops looked like before but

865
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:49,220
then they did reply and here's what they

866
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,130
replied with so stomachs get a little

867
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,420
bit icy with me now remember it's a CEO

868
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,920
so I should really give him some respect

869
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,320
here

870
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,670
so tell me again what to do with it I

871
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,139
should just go to Michael local

872
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:04,520
Walgreens store which we have many in

873
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:06,170
the UK is a US company so yeah get it

874
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,929
right away so you can get a sense of

875
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,760
urgency now you know and so on so you

876
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,080
see he's getting really annoyed so I

877
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,000
should really help them out and be like

878
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:19,130
kind of helpful kind of person I am so

879
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,469
here's what I did so I do have one just

880
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,500
funnily enough and here's how to get to

881
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:26,719
it now some of you a few of you may

882
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,480
recognize the format of that hyperlink

883
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:32,139
so that image I've sent him it's not a

884
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:36,320
normal kind of photo of 750 dollars it's

885
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:38,449
something from it's a canary token so I

886
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,040
- I see if you click on that gift I've

887
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,290
supposedly sentencing but you see how I

888
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:50,029
care about security so you know link

889
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:55,759
yeah it's HD this not you didn't appears

890
00:34:50,030 --> 00:35:00,410
quickly of course five letters takes use

891
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,320
for that's math so I gave him a quick a

892
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,819
quick link to an image which I do you

893
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,400
care about security cities private honey

894
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,760
he would know it let's see if they click

895
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,380
that and this is where I kind of stopped

896
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,760
because I knew there's no way they click

897
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,830
on that unfortunately so I was going to

898
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,510
wait and try on doing my work still

899
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,490
waiting and then just one did something

900
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,590
else until slack popped up with a

901
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:25,100
notification so

902
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:28,470
idiots cameras now clicks on it with

903
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,450
these details that thinks pretend

904
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,129
provide all free it's tell me stuff

905
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,689
about this person now there are two

906
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,970
manager was sitting next to me at this

907
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,290
point and fascinating scene ever seen

908
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,450
it's kind of canary token so you can get

909
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,620
people to click on find stuff and he

910
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,970
thought it was all kind of funny I

911
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,080
showed in this website if you want to go

912
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,430
through it you can download free stuff

913
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,090
stick these in various place like

914
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:49,049
Dropbox and all clicks on it you'll know

915
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,570
but the first thing I did learn from

916
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,890
this process was he then said yeah it's

917
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,900
time to call it quits Carl because you

918
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,220
messing around with like threats and

919
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,410
everything so I please just stop messing

920
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,640
around so the first thing I learned is

921
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:07,020
IT managers no fun I think we already

922
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,900
knew that but but the second thing they

923
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,370
can still take from this is if you don't

924
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,990
like I do selling that we've been

925
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,850
talking about this whole presentation

926
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,680
just think about if people hacking

927
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,080
because that's exactly always happened

928
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,660
to me he was pretend to be a CEO preying

929
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,540
urgency create words like expense if you

930
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,660
knew a trigger any employees kind of a

931
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,920
motive thing of I need to apply you

932
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,839
know those those were very very

933
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,940
carefully crafted words that he knew

934
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:37,200
would get to me and they did make me

935
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:39,600
look into this so if you don't like

936
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,240
selling be like hacking people call it

937
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,040
that and the final war story will eat

938
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,709
you if it's never waste the crisis so

939
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:50,430
one of my first jobs I was looking after

940
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:51,990
IT security the cut the company I was

941
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,250
working for had a really big client in

942
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,350
and they were going to show them this

943
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,330
fantastic system that has created and

944
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,690
demonstrate in front of them exactly how

945
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,850
is fantastic new web application was

946
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,740
except the developers didn't know that

947
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:07,650
it was actually being used as production

948
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,259
and it left it in a devastate and so you

949
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:12,390
know the the demo comes round and I get

950
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,460
the CEO burst into the office I was in

951
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,259
at the time saying we've been hacked you

952
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,140
need to you need to find out what's

953
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,210
happened because this this you know

954
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,040
server has been hit by some ransomware a

955
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,980
classic case of dev slipping into

956
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,870
product that would never happen you know

957
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:30,150
so yeah we scroll around and managed to

958
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,950
secure the server the downside is the

959
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,360
client is coming in you know in five

960
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,730
minutes time and we need to really make

961
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,380
sure

962
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,970
there is a demo and at this point when

963
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,859
you're early in your career you do

964
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,600
anything possible to make sure your pond

965
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:42,549
a good show and you're often a little

966
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,220
bit too eager so I've spent the next

967
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:47,530
five minutes turning what was the old

968
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,149
website into a recreated one from

969
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,040
powerpoints are complete with click

970
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:52,960
buttons and they presented it to the

971
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,970
client they still walk so if they'll

972
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,470
show you never waste prices in my place

973
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,910
I then got the budget signed off to

974
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,189
actually fix some other stuff that had

975
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,569
been found but you know never waste a

976
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,730
crisis and with that we will leave you

977
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:06,490
with some key takeaways to make sure

978
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,920
that you can never suffer the silver the

979
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,750
first is be empathetic you know many

980
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,800
people are going to have conflicting

981
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,390
requirements inside your organization

982
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,130
you've gotta listen to them and be

983
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,990
prepared to make a compromise as

984
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,150
Security's not black and white and many

985
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,790
people talk about it being a journey not

986
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,200
you know in a process so you have to

987
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,869
make sure you're empathetic with what

988
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,810
the rest of the organization wants to do

989
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:29,920
secondly that's that's bad but how about

990
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,020
you know we've talked previously about

991
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,970
the four now five tiers of risk

992
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,500
management you need to understand how to

993
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,359
do risk management because that's the

994
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,070
language senior management talks and

995
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,109
often you'll find many of the risks that

996
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,090
from your perspective are really bad

997
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,410
they'll just be tolerated because the

998
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,030
person who's making the decision is

999
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,879
quite happy to take the risk and it's

1000
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,369
their money so why not thirdly have that

1001
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,050
business appreciation you've got to

1002
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:55,119
appreciate how security fits into the

1003
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,650
bigger picture from my site particularly

1004
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,630
in the organization I'm in at the minute

1005
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,770
security is a huge part about trust

1006
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,240
you're never going to put your money

1007
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,770
into a financial institution if you

1008
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,049
don't trust them to look after it so

1009
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,340
that's how I have to you know discussion

1010
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,560
with the rest of the organization and

1011
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:11,140
say actually I can create trust from a

1012
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,240
security perspective by doing things

1013
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,940
that demonstrate security which then

1014
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,350
create trust the fourth one is have a

1015
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,510
positive attitude you know we're all on

1016
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,640
the same side sometimes mistakes are

1017
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,950
going to be made I've never seen a major

1018
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,390
breach occur where somebody didn't learn

1019
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,910
from it you didn't work in IT security

1020
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,859
and change the way they thought so it's

1021
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:33,160
always worth appreciating that and

1022
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:34,900
finally have pride you know we all love

1023
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,029
the job that we do but sometimes you do

1024
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,280
have to pick your balance because you're

1025
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,570
not going to win all the time

1026
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,070
yeah sometimes you have to swallow your

1027
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,210
pride sometimes you have to swallow some

1028
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,160
 but

1029
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,420
at the same time we also do have to have

1030
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,308
pride in what we do and there is a

1031
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,020
balance to be had so if any of you

1032
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:53,540
starting out in your career or want to

1033
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:56,470
get into in place SEC it's a tough place

1034
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:58,880
it's a wide place some great things

1035
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,049
please don't take any negativity from

1036
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,790
all the toilets about today because we

1037
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,470
both do get paid way too well I think

1038
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,599
everyone this room gets paid by too much

1039
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:08,540
that's the career room it's a great

1040
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,280
industry fantastic if you all got proper

1041
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,200
jobs that'll get paid a lot less but

1042
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,430
it's fantastic and there are some

1043
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,069
difficult sides to it but hopefully

1044
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,770
these five kind of points can give you a

1045
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:20,569
bit of a business insight into how to

1046
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:25,089
work that politics and certainly a bit

1047
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:25,089
better thank you Bob thank you

1048
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:46,230
any questions anyone anyone else yes a

1049
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,230
question scarlet if it's a statement

1050
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,230
[Music]

1051
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,440
reciprocation from the other side as

1052
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,350
well

1053
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,200
so question is Arab woman should there

1054
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:07,000
be should both sides get honest and a

1055
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,310
middle tribe you know should you shift

1056
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,100
yourself just to the marketing mindset

1057
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,779
or should marketing come a lot closer in

1058
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,990
ideaa world yeah absolutely

1059
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,000
often sales is about trying to

1060
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,950
manipulate or change their requirements

1061
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,690
so they do think a bit more like you but

1062
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,779
ultimately you're trying to jump into

1063
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,040
their mindset so I'd say it's about 5%

1064
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:34,060
of bringing them on board night

1065
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:35,800
five-star on the other anyone else nope

1066
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,460
we're around all day at all evening so

1067
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,460
thank you again
