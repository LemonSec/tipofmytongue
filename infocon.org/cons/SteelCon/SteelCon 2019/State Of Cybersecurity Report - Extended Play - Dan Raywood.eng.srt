1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,138
so what my presenter today is info

2
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:12,280
security magazine stateside security

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:15,248
report inversion to extended play why

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,610
extended play short play seven inch

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:20,950
version was done in PO sec in was about

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:24,100
a month ago and when I launched the

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,780
report and I thought how do I make it

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,910
you know there are some slightly longer

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,560
version so I put the EP some people know

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,910
by and we'll get that most of you

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,949
probably clueless and I couldn't think

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,829
of a better title than extended play so

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,899
now it's race for that one so yeah the

14
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:41,019
idea here is a talk I gave it info SEC

15
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,699
yes it five weeks ago six weeks ago with

16
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:45,789
a bit more depth on some of the research

17
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:47,679
we did as part of this report and I've

18
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:49,030
got a little bit of stuff for you you're

19
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,239
gonna get the 30th first ones to see

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,409
something brand new so yeah contain your

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,459
excitement and don't throw the jelly

22
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:57,489
babies at me right

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,359
so before we kick off just a bit about

24
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,399
me

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,979
so I do a friend by security magazine I

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,780
am on the record officially stopped my

27
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,460
language clean yeah I've been there

28
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,369
since December 15 or so form around this

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,289
at four five one and two other jobs so

30
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:14,200
it eleven years

31
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,909
cybersecurity almost and my third steal

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,460
comment second one being a speaker and

33
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm yeah overwhelmed especially I've

34
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,479
been promoted as in track three last on

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,020
track to Bastogne so really really great

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,189
to be here um so really an agenda of

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,130
what we're going to be doing today so

38
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:33,038
what is the report whilst writing site

39
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:37,270
security some comparisons to other stuff

40
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:38,950
and fused friends still come special I'm

41
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,990
gonna save that which is because it's

42
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,759
that exciting and just a little bit more

43
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:49,149
information at the end so last year we

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,770
did a stateside security report I and

45
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,119
some journalist friends at the front

46
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,679
here can probably test the fact we can

47
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,049
write yell out after maybe ten threat

48
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:57,549
reports a week some days you know the

49
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,679
Piazza bring you and say have you got my

50
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,990
press release about on you this that the

51
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:04,479
other from you know a piece of research

52
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,899
done by this one poll or poly mode or

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,899
something like that

54
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,019
another thing I'm gonna do another time

55
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,950
is just prove out people dismiss these

56
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,230
because they're ultimately trying to

57
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,518
sell something so we thought last year

58
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,819
in the post that we thought why don't we

59
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,379
do

60
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,958
one and there's a little bit more in

61
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:22,540
editorial integral a bit more integrity

62
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,400
to it and it's one that we actually

63
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,138
create ourselves its editorial we've

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,939
done it's not many kind of influence

65
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:29,139
about front of cells and product it's

66
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,760
just about what people in the industry

67
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:35,049
told us was about what's happening in

68
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,260
cybersecurity so last year we talked to

69
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:40,930
32 people and I get to why in a second

70
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,120
we'd start a little bit late what paper

71
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:48,280
release at startup InfoSec last year and

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,319
882 again download it as a sort of tenth

73
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,319
so three days ago I lost the biggest

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,030
we're reading the 32 is I find it a bit

75
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,040
late I'm honest I got going about maybe

76
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,540
March April time and when you go to

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,798
people with a new idea you've got to go

78
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,388
to this or say this is what the guys are

79
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,769
doing some people little bit skeptical

80
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,109
they're always a bit like oh what's this

81
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,909
going to lead to so yeah that's a number

82
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:08,049
we hear and when I saw draw a line by

83
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,578
which I've got finished the research

84
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,739
about the writing so that was last year

85
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:12,989
and energy went down really well because

86
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:16,000
you can see why the number of downloads

87
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,150
so these are the top findings from 2018

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,709
and the thing to kind of bear in mind

89
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,150
here is that I did that bulk of the

90
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,750
research probably around Salt March

91
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,400
April 20 18 G DPR came in top up you

92
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,979
know gdpr and regulation and compliance

93
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,689
came in top yeah the world was thinking

94
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:34,689
about GDP are at that's on 25th and may

95
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:37,709
looming heavily so pretty huge surprise

96
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:40,358
that came in number two there 34 percent

97
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,209
was the expanding threat landscape we

98
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,639
were a year off of wanna cry and then

99
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,189
what about 910 months Austin's not

100
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,419
better if all the attacks it was very

101
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,819
very prominent that things were getting

102
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,590
pretty bad and even though that was

103
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,478
evolving attack theoretically what too

104
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,449
sophisticated but they were around their

105
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,250
board level recognition same reason 21

106
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:02,290
percent exactly the same things all over

107
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,009
the newspapers people are taking it

108
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,069
seriously

109
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,540
and clouds 21 percent and then sudden

110
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,698
panic which I absolutely love that came

111
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,019
in so high and I don't think that's

112
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,549
changed at all I'm looking forward to

113
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:16,090
the bear farmers talk all about that in

114
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:17,259
a couple of hours so that was 2018 and I

115
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,630
said you know the response was pretty

116
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:22,750
good so we thought hey let's do it again

117
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,830
it's aversion to 60 people this year

118
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,870
when you actually ought to be you can

119
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,039
point to and you can say this is what

120
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,480
we're doing this is why we're doing it

121
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,099
people will be much more willing

122
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,350
come to your answer your emails look

123
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,600
what I've got the didn't but the reason

124
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,940
60 is because I was aiming originally

125
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,410
for about 100 when that became pretty

126
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,450
obvious so might not hit that number I

127
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,340
thought I'd go for 50 instead then all

128
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,710
of a sudden 50 became about 53 I'd like

129
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,130
let's just round it to 60 and we'll do

130
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,690
with that six weeks of research fed to a

131
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,150
cruel the very first interview I did was

132
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,920
on Valentine's Day with the lovely Edie

133
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,739
Tucker people watching or if he's ever

134
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,960
heard this that we finished April 19 the

135
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,450
last little tooth Nicola weighty from 13

136
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,780
so two really cool people so starting in

137
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,950
these with and so determing 31 distinct

138
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,239
trends I don't know if I've got 31

139
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,500
people in the room here I probably

140
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,810
haven't if I asked all of you but I'm

141
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,550
not going to do it I made something

142
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,030
about cybersecurity using strike inside

143
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,500
the security I guarantee almost that we

144
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,940
don't get the same answer we've got the

145
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
same answer and over again more than one

146
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,820
of you would say DDoS more than one of

147
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,770
you would say client more than one of

148
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,980
you would say let them just been talking

149
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,419
about open Internet communication 31

150
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,240
this is just so become diversity of

151
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:35,380
thought we have in cybersecurity from

152
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,450
this five top trends fight lower 21 6 10

153
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,219
in terms of into the number of responses

154
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,349
we had so I kind of group them together

155
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,210
and then wonder I was really interested

156
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,770
by 8 single response trends where one

157
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,599
person said something that wasn't synced

158
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,580
by anybody at the kind of googlewhack

159
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,950
of this of this report so I did that

160
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,880
presentation and InfoSec and I did get a

161
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,920
lot of questions about who you like

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,870
survey I mentioned to their head Nicola

163
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,330
I'm not keen on just you know it's all

164
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,150
throwing away the names up so these are

165
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,890
some of the job titles really and some

166
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,140
of you probably figure out from who are

167
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,090
- they were but some of them I kind of

168
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,190
grouped together so for example your

169
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,500
garbage of cybersecurity but some CISOs

170
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,650
yeah doing those roles kind of gesture

171
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,420
generally so that was sort of preparing

172
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,120
preparation of the report room for doing

173
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,280
this year

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,620
roll on number one top train pilot

175
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,030
problems tech troubles things not

176
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,300
working detection

177
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,010
issues no I have convergence all these

178
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,400
issues that are on these the only

179
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,990
through these were the actual responses

180
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,289
this week and I went back and I picked

181
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,599
out the top terms more

182
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:44,058
technologies and problems a step in the

183
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,219
cycle a constant crisis detection issue

184
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:48,889
doesn't pick anything up vulnerability

185
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:53,180
management rubbish multi deployment

186
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:56,029
projects fishing to many claims no no

187
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,589
positive about technology the loads are

188
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:00,499
feeling that things were really really

189
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:01,849
rubbish around this and too much legacy

190
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,979
technology I get on sat in the next

191
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:07,520
slide these are some of the actual

192
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:09,409
crazies came from the actual report this

193
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,049
is great for 16 attack vectors there are

194
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:13,909
26 technology sector which I do the

195
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,240
problems with more technology problems

196
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:19,069
so if you go in as a you know an

197
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,719
acquirer of technology you've got this

198
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,249
issue where actually got too much choice

199
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:28,129
to actually try and solve the same

200
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:29,930
problem with second one the big-ticket

201
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,029
solutions they bought haven't actually

202
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,800
delivered people think being sold about

203
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,110
these things about plug-and-play and

204
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,499
works out the box apparently that

205
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,999
doesn't work either and number three the

206
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:43,519
animations which really won't good for a

207
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:46,219
fast-paced security sitting on a massive

208
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,159
mountain evolved technology and I was

209
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:51,949
asked what I meant by legacy buyers and

210
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:54,319
I did present this too and I said it

211
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,330
kind of turned some how you determine

212
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,800
legacy technology some might think of

213
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,139
like for example the on fireworks from

214
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,610
the mid 90s I'm not gonna source don't

215
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,259
even say anything wrong with those if

216
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,620
you can figure those two actually work

217
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,089
to the level that you need and there's

218
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,069
nothing technically wrong with them and

219
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,659
that's absolutely great what I think

220
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,490
legacy comes down to the what people

221
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:17,959
mentioned means our old code old

222
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,639
applications and old software so one go

223
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,389
in particular to talk to you mentioned

224
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,309
ss7

225
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,199
which has not evolved to the change

226
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:25,749
something requires which requires

227
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,979
companies to change at the same time

228
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:29,479
proper love written 30 years ago which

229
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,740
were to relying on we're never gonna be

230
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,550
able to strip out so this is what we

231
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,229
meant by legacy

232
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,789
these all these things that technology

233
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,939
that's not really working so that was

234
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:43,419
why that was our top finding this year

235
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:46,009
and that you go so them to human factor

236
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,040
that's been a that's been a laugh over

237
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:50,149
the recent years doesn't it really the

238
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,949
discussions around the weakest /

239
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,910
strongest link 31 percent of our

240
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,740
audience that we

241
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,410
so you thought human factor issues were

242
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,380
our second biggest problem and these are

243
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,939
some of the reasons why awareness

244
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,840
schemes

245
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,980
upskilling people I thought was really

246
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,860
interesting how we haven't got the

247
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,420
capability to push people from mid-level

248
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,010
and junior positions up to senior

249
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,560
positions because there's just nothing

250
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,330
availability there more time and money

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,310
being spent on culture a social

252
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,800
engineering skills shortage all has a

253
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,349
laugh they're hiring misalignment which

254
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,180
some people did refer to instead how

255
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,320
this the right people and the right jobs

256
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,939
just aren't really coming together

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,800
because there's just this problem there

258
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,540
of finding people who can do the right

259
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:35,660
things training certifications also came

260
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,579
into this how can businesses enable

261
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,110
their peoples be better at their job and

262
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,150
also we got in their bottom left

263
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,850
empathetic and pathetic awareness

264
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,770
empathy let's focus on this blind

265
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,570
concept we have inside security which

266
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,880
doesn't make life any good any better

267
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,860
from anyone and also social engineering

268
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,050
in there this is you know so easy to

269
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,410
target someone so very hard to stop very

270
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,459
very difficult to do and yeah I'm sure

271
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,420
you most of you know that social

272
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,770
engineering if you hadn't listened to

273
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,360
people at Jenny Radcliffe's podcast

274
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,920
really recommended some really good

275
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,000
stuff on their attitude about social

276
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,650
engineering and how it works

277
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,130
defending against it is a whole

278
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,260
different thing a few comments whoops

279
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,220
sorry okay if so many still here people

280
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,020
are the weakest link

281
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,230
but fewer attempts being made to

282
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,439
actually support them all agree with

283
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,410
that

284
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,180
and it goes on and on about that we're

285
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,010
creating a talent deficits ourselves

286
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,540
we're not actually resolving these

287
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,640
problems which is creating more of

288
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,680
issues but not really realizing the

289
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,360
issues that can be available to them

290
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,969
there belong the one here but I'll let

291
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,070
you read that through social engineering

292
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,450
as a social engineering is kind of one

293
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,800
of the big challenges of industry

294
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,350
because it's not even a technology

295
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,740
problem it's more of a culture problem

296
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,270
and that's a big a big issue really for

297
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,920
too much expectation really the people

298
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,050
being able to be as good as security a

299
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,640
we are you know when this is fantastic

300
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,689
conferences then I go to you know other

301
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,280
conferences as well

302
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,220
sitting on ones really brilliant people

303
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,290
but actually the reality is and your

304
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,820
employees aren't here your CEOs I'm here

305
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,819
and they're the ones getting targeted by

306
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,050
this so it's a real challenge and I

307
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,360
don't think that's an easy one to solve

308
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,569
is the heat

309
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,220
number three employments back number one

310
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,300
last year

311
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,430
number three this year that really did

312
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,219
prove that gdpr was on everybody's mind

313
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,650
as well through research last year not

314
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,030
just gdpr this year also things like PSD

315
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:29,090
to the California CPA that consumer

316
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,380
Krita see act n is directive compliance

317
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,270
in general trying to get businesses

318
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,640
compliant but the fact is is that

319
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,140
compliance was two places low and didn't

320
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,390
come up as much and see when I started

321
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,740
this research this was barely being cite

322
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,480
that that's gonna be a real headline

323
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,400
that compliance drops out at AA fight

324
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,620
then it got a bit more coverage people

325
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,150
are talk to a tribe not store to me

326
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,350
don't oversee people because I have just

327
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,459
been all over this I think I've Dan

328
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,580
talked about compliance is all about

329
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,610
compliance wasn't the case but the fact

330
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,140
is it can comply it's easily a problem

331
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,390
and yeah I can probably tell us how

332
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,710
rewrote these slides or posting per

333
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,840
second in the last week or so and

334
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,940
compliance is probably on everybody's

335
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,480
minds after these two fines this week of

336
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,910
BA and Meriah 183 million and 99 million

337
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,350
we tended to find by the ACO to be a and

338
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:17,900
Mary at someone's not 277 280 odd

339
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,490
million that's really good compliance

340
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,560
back in the mind so again probably

341
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,270
something that would go up again and the

342
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,130
first year of GDP are maybe didn't

343
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,400
deliver and these are some of the

344
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,770
reasons why regulatory frameworks as I

345
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,230
mentioned PSD to PCI there's another one

346
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,300
gets everyone that no good old fun where

347
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,740
emphasis on it interesting response some

348
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,380
of these standards are driving better

349
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,600
standards of security regulate driving

350
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,580
best standards of security international

351
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,550
impacts people saw the thing in GDP I'll

352
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,590
go never sees impact on people and just

353
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,120
some of the codes we've got this is kind

354
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,160
of what was it really kinda across

355
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,070
slightly about regulation has died down

356
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,689
everyone was really really up for it and

357
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,220
then it kind of dropped off and it

358
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,590
didn't become so popular after all

359
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,120
because everyone thought GDP art been

360
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:07,010
full of false promises first better into

361
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
the response practices and all in the

362
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,890
cyber security field arrived in their

363
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,870
hands about the vendors worth and that

364
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,250
providing the services because suddenly

365
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,510
it's is actually being doing things

366
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,230
better and actually going out and

367
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,600
finding the

368
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,700
incidents and looking into them crazy

369
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,250
probably a whole new sector or suddenly

370
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,590
revamp the whole new sector that was

371
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,440
actually enabling all this and then

372
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,180
third one yeah much to save gtp I hasn't

373
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,530
at the impose five mister while expected

374
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,709
that can say this obviously came in long

375
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,990
before this week so I see when that

376
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,530
fella comes around in the in the coming

377
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,840
years

378
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:44,939
so before company board engagement it's

379
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,380
an interesting one because you know

380
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,720
obviously watching down of what some

381
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,330
other younger people presenting here at

382
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,410
still gone today and it's the idea of

383
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,850
how much can you actually get your

384
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,189
people out and how much you have to

385
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,080
actually engage with the business

386
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,940
alternatively has I'll push here it's

387
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,590
not just about business people in the

388
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,940
term given immature market which it is

389
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,830
it's about people who don't understand

390
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,450
Social Security but also now a different

391
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,430
discussion between the CEO and the board

392
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,230
we've arguably got a broad name probably

393
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,020
understand cybersecurity I think maybe

394
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,450
not to the level of what most of you

395
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,160
will probably will but also can they

396
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,200
actually understand now that this is an

397
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,240
issue the data protection is a big issue

398
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,730
because our 280 or million have been

399
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,570
levied at two companies in this week so

400
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,670
you're something you've got to take

401
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,860
seriously and speaking the same language

402
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,569
measuring culture making coaches massive

403
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,160
as she's more real than you realize I

404
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,300
mean I tried to look yesterday when I

405
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,579
was running through these slides try to

406
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,069
find the dollar amount that the note

407
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,970
before I position of a cairo is company

408
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,770
CL TR e I don't find it so I don't know

409
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,990
how many millions and millions cultures

410
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,910
now worth but I know it's a lot of money

411
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,620
that are coming I know before is gonna

412
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,180
go out and buy a company that does

413
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,560
culture and that's their thing about you

414
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,189
know measuring your metrics of your

415
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,060
company

416
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:59,130
so it's not the job the company to make

417
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,040
them more secure help itself stuff meet

418
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,020
their vision it's not about being sort

419
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,089
of the IT Crowd in the basement trying

420
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,860
to fix everything it's about trying to

421
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,060
map the business actually operate and

422
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,780
help them work and help them actually

423
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,430
meet their vision as it says then second

424
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,199
one third room is where lessons and not

425
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,030
learned too many issues that are not

426
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,890
understood I've taken on learn from

427
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,150
experience maybe it's all a little bit

428
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,710
too much like yesterday's fish and chip

429
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,170
paper sometimes it's people just don't

430
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,260
me understand these things

431
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,310
however is taken more seriously by than

432
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,770
it wasn't the part you can see by these

433
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,030
comments how diverse the responses are

434
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,189
when it comes to these different sectors

435
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,560
but ultimately our people are talking

436
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,210
about this and it is it is taking more

437
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,469
seriously but they don't understood it's

438
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,130
something that may be a little step

439
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,220
forward than we were before

440
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:49,680
last of the top five automation AI and

441
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,730
machine learning gets a lot of mixed

442
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,439
views these two because there's a lot of

443
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,320
fat that's not now there's a lot of

444
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,480
people claiming they can do it and it's

445
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,800
all a case of that automation first

446
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,080
humans second if you're going to do it

447
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,380
put your all in with that DevOps shift

448
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,320
left how to do dfi our stocks automated

449
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,560
end points too much fun on AI and

450
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,170
machine learning and immature market and

451
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,969
UAB a yeah lots of mixed responses

452
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,319
people think this is a driver however a

453
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,400
lot of people excited this is saw

454
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,230
something that's actually going to move

455
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,310
forward in the future also there's

456
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,720
something that's just made me immature

457
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,550
and something to keep an eye on but the

458
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,890
fact is one of the see says I did

459
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,510
interview as part of this was kind of a

460
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,550
comment Greenfield see so he was

461
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,310
literally building his security team as

462
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,319
the first see so that his company had

463
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,089
appointed so he was literally he was all

464
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,770
over light machine learning because he's

465
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,320
now being able to build a suite it's

466
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,970
actually based on these concepts rather

467
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,370
than if you're working in for example

468
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,770
among more than thing legacy known about

469
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,240
on the farm you get on five but and

470
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,069
maybe a more effort Bank for example

471
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,950
where the securities probably been there

472
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,570
for decades how do you put these things

473
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,700
in and make your configure things to

474
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,440
actually work with machine learning

475
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,709
probably quite a challenge you some of

476
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,030
the comments we go on that there's

477
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,880
concern about lack of understanding of

478
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,530
non symbolic and symbolic I'm not sure

479
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,660
how anybody here actually understands

480
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,060
the two I put my hand I had no idea what

481
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,280
this meant so I had to google it

482
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,290
probably symbolic is good old-fashioned

483
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,230
AI makes use of strings that represent

484
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:26,010
real world entities or concepts non

485
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,480
symbolic is about providing real what

486
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,240
dates the machine and leaving it to

487
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,260
recognizing patterns and create its own

488
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,220
representations if you want to know more

489
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,450
a couple ret to Sousa re h rh e TT for a

490
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,210
medium blog where he goes into this

491
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,309
needs those two bits

492
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:44,990
so for non symbolic vs. symbolic so

493
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:46,490
that's one of the factors of a I love

494
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,140
hide greatest thing since sliced bread

495
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,789
this is one of the problems that people

496
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,710
think it's going to be great but when

497
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:57,080
will it be great one might be famous and

498
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,220
also it must be automation first humans

499
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,649
second if you are going to do it

500
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,669
apparently go all-in

501
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:03,559
how many of you can actually do that I

502
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:05,659
don't know something because you go in

503
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,899
and just sort of make me humans the

504
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,070
second factor off you've got in you know

505
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:13,879
enabled them all to be as fantastic as

506
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:17,090
they can so that was the table top five

507
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,549
and one more sorry of his it meant value

508
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,340
and fear what it does it's a new thing

509
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:24,408
in technology and were terrified of it

510
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,939
five and just a little party on there

511
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,010
are some the representation of the top

512
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,960
five as they came out and that's a

513
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,879
slightly better way of looking at it I

514
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,620
will put my hand up and I will I bet you

515
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,840
know it was a different sample this year

516
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,689
we said last year 32 people this year 60

517
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,289
people so the different values go up and

518
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,990
down and secondly gdpr was a huge factor

519
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,429
last year we saw pile of in this year

520
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,140
week last year didn't see coming this

521
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,309
year

522
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,919
automating hangs around we didn't see

523
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:55,010
 this year maybe was more positive

524
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,470
but at the same time the 2019 trends are

525
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,820
there right in front of you say product

526
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:04,100
35:31 human 25 compliance 18 each for

527
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,529
automation and borne engagement so yeah

528
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,059
these kind of very business e issues

529
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,850
actually this year which are poppin the

530
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:12,260
sort of the no I'd argue outs you bring

531
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,879
me a pop them on automating their before

532
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,500
really business issues actually we're

533
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,419
dealing as there's the real drivers

534
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,799
beside the security which I thought was

535
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,000
interesting it's not all about the kind

536
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,470
of the malware anymore it's not all

537
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,520
about the kind of the coyote anymore it

538
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,870
seems to be all about the way the

539
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,330
businesses can actually run their

540
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,928
businesses better the better employees

541
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,850
be better at being applying and would

542
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,520
just be better at everything really so

543
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,389
that was what kind of caught my interest

544
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,100
so we'll move on to the lower trends and

545
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,049
leave what kind of six to ten almost in

546
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,939
the top ten and these were as follows I

547
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:46,279
put them all on there I want to separate

548
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,309
the mouths of Hygiene number six as it

549
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,680
were they start talking the basics this

550
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:54,950
has been really prominent through 2019

551
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:58,160
for us Pat's management involved ability

552
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,620
management doing the basics and all that

553
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,300
kind of stuff the aforementioned ed

554
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,830
Tucker was on a webinar as I was

555
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,930
moderating and he said if the basics was

556
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,250
so easy we don't be doing them well the

557
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,230
fact is they're not they're not easy

558
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,790
inside behind you do get that's gets

559
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,190
later a lot of people to actually do the

560
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,870
basics then I said if it was that easy

561
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,380
we don't be doing it but that does that

562
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,520
just missed out and I'm on top by crowd

563
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,680
was quite interesting they didn't come

564
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,080
in hire considering now we talked about

565
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,510
AWS this year and proliferation of

566
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,290
infrastructure as a service but they

567
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,430
only came in sort of seventh place apt

568
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,510
nation-state this one really

569
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,730
surprisingly everyone was talking about

570
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,550
this because this is another one apt

571
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,740
gets really kind of rolled out as a bit

572
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,270
of a fun effort really but it seems this

573
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,490
year people were actually genuine it and

574
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,139
one of the reasons why it was because of

575
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,200
government intervention and maybe

576
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,120
election interference and how apts are

577
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
actually getting an attacking people and

578
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,879
it's all got something to be really

579
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,590
taken seriously about nation-state

580
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,730
malware

581
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,290
speaking of malware came in there just

582
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,510
below a cryptid malware things like

583
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,520
people printing ransomware and mentioned

584
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,290
different business email compromised

585
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,750
stuff like that actually direct kind of

586
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,200
software based malware as it well file

587
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,820
as malware but yeah took in advancement

588
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,500
of attackers as well so what kind of

589
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,080
groups into that one but not nothing

590
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,030
really huge and then Agilent

591
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,429
transformation when I started doing this

592
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,139
research this was really high this was I

593
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,840
thought was new number one with digital

594
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,550
transformation and agility and then as I

595
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,470
went on everyone stopped talking about a

596
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,460
knight to chair a panel in any posts a

597
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:34,220
for an hour with four people and we went

598
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,020
off everywhere but it's interesting and

599
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,490
concept of digital transformation I

600
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,870
think a lot of people want to understand

601
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,330
what it is and what it means for them

602
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,100
but reality of it actually is it's just

603
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,810
a way of business is working and

604
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,179
security being left behind is my

605
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:51,889
impression of it so it's it's good and

606
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,600
bad I can see that but let's move on the

607
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,000
single response trends these were the

608
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,550
ones that cited by one person at the 60

609
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,090
I leave here to look at that for one

610
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,379
second because it suddenly is you might

611
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,510
look out and think I can't believe one

612
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,549
person mentioned but managed services

613
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,620
I can't believe one person mentioned bug

614
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:13,610
bounties that did one person said bug

615
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,870
bounties buzzing I suspect here I'm

616
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,969
gonna get more interested in knowing

617
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,510
what fuzzy as I did it InfoSec in first

618
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,530
thing I probably sold senior audience I

619
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,929
spent three hour pen testers in the

620
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,790
audience here automated software testing

621
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:28,940
you know how to Google that as well by I

622
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:30,200
have heard of buzzing but yeah analytics

623
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,610
ratings I think is quite interesting one

624
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,440
cuz its that's all benchmarking things

625
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,939
as well of actually how you know you are

626
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,169
listening more companies come out with

627
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:41,840
those kind of technologies but now the

628
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,799
report came out and a couple of days

629
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,379
later one of the people I've actually

630
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,750
talked to who is a consultant and you

631
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,330
see a performer garden and I was message

632
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,690
me instead report down thanks very much

633
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,178
and he said how come um containerization

634
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,950
didn't make it you know god I'm an email

635
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,620
now yet now saying why didn't this make

636
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,010
it in so this is the DM that the person

637
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,090
sent me and it's very small on my screen

638
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,809
responder most maybe it's been there

639
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,000
done that

640
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,700
every single company I work with is

641
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,110
doing something with containers okay I

642
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,700
look back at all the responses and see

643
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,469
what I've got contains two people

644
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,720
mentioned containers and they've just

645
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,130
pledged with the quotes I got about

646
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,429
containers lot more bang for your buck

647
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:25,250
without security overheads adoption of

648
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:29,290
container technologies as kuba Nets

649
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,000
could be that's SAP announcer thanks

650
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:35,418
skipping you like here I believe matures

651
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,710
I don't wait to smoke virtual systems

652
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,880
that you don't have to manage in patch

653
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,610
actually that makes it sound quite good

654
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:46,730
actually best to hold containers while

655
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,600
other support errors ensure holding

656
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,220
containers

657
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,500
better cloud strategy reducing wave so

658
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,919
that you read the money from my way

659
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,350
around it

660
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,460
so yeah containers actually I got my

661
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,570
tail on yeah I can tell you is actually

662
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,340
quite interesting one that actually they

663
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,110
came up with those those points so I

664
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,899
think the people who actually did

665
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,580
mention that his hobbies gonna probably

666
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,470
the quotes out of anything that we

667
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,909
didn't pick up and so what what people

668
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,169
said about it but yeah it's just one

669
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,580
that came up and I didn't really done

670
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:16,100
that into cloud because I was different

671
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:19,340
enough from crowd to be a not considered

672
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:22,639
part of it so if the only to do was

673
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,230
how other research had actually kind of

674
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,880
categorized these trends and how they

675
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,080
stood up against what some of the other

676
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,500
people out there were actually we're

677
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,990
talking about so I picked up four five

678
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,670
organizations got their four five one

679
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,740
slide security ventures PwC and CLABSI

680
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,540
so and I looked at them all they don't

681
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,300
have these different research things

682
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,750
like top ten security projects the

683
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,010
almanaque maturity report all these

684
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,050
these companies I thought let's try to

685
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,970
line up my friends up against their

686
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,830
trends let's see how they work out this

687
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,040
is quite text heavy so I walk you

688
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,360
through so essentially what I'm finding

689
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,340
is that most of the people out there

690
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,530
don't really come correlate with what

691
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,030
I've done now I tried talking to all of

692
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,430
them about why they thought that was and

693
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,810
he just didn't really kind of go along

694
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:09,020
with it so that she's just different

695
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,310
sample sets off but yet take on the

696
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,650
troubles only really came up against

697
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:16,070
countless detection responses and two of

698
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:19,550
PwC's complies there as you can see only

699
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:22,340
came up all those five different lists

700
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,500
only came up against site security

701
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:28,820
vendors CSV personal and dates pretty

702
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,890
Gartner no 451 no Club seats are talking

703
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,510
about compliance it's really this is the

704
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,520
headline for me of this year's research

705
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,760
is that this didn't really come back

706
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,990
again it was really a 2018 trend

707
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,940
engaging the border smoke Club see so

708
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,920
security culture I did bloom that in

709
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,960
engaging with the board no one's talking

710
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,520
about that is it just because I went to

711
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,350
should be the slide earlier on with on

712
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,550
people I talk to direct side securities

713
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,959
companies directors various see so

714
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:56,830
engaging with the board is that level of

715
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,210
thing now for that senior person

716
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,020
automation it's all over automation

717
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,580
really - yeah

718
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,560
security operations will undergo

719
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,389
transformation and DevOps application

720
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,210
thanks work front one this Scott wrote

721
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,890
about resilient business for five at PwC

722
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,630
and then three others of clopsies an

723
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,130
alternation you can't really escape the

724
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,790
automation thing because it seems to be

725
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:19,250
everywhere and speaking of which I did

726
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:22,129
ask a lot of people and actually got to

727
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,540
33 of our 60 samples that were so KQ

728
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,710
missing trends what you think you're

729
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,690
really gonna happen to the future what

730
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,340
what's going to drive the future and

731
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,650
unsurprisingly it was automation because

732
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,549
it since I heard about automation for

733
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,080
this

734
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:34,940
these are some of the points we've got

735
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,799
so 36% I wasn't gonna do a top five

736
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,110
because they're what this was so a high

737
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,299
understand he knows here so 64 percent

738
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,070
they were so broken down there and

739
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,500
automation and so I just picked this one

740
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,149
out and just with these quotes here

741
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,720
Caroline people scratching the surface

742
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:53,539
if it's possibilities any viable choice

743
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,179
for defense of scope so kind of looking

744
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:57,890
at now in the future now automation is

745
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:01,070
really apparent one the top five drivers

746
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,990
it's the main driver for the future last

747
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,610
year's it came up as future and current

748
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,220
so it's one of the things we seem to be

749
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,149
talking about consistently and actually

750
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,220
last I can tell you was twenty eight

751
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:12,320
percent of respondents in the future

752
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,049
trends was a document AI and automation

753
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,428
technologies so I'd never hear of see

754
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:18,529
this if we do this again next year

755
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:21,559
if we'll see that again but it's it's a

756
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:23,419
real kind of persisting trend really as

757
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,860
automation let's think a lot of people

758
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:26,330
talk about it and there isn't some

759
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,428
vendors doing good stuff around it could

760
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,668
really good research as well but it does

761
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:34,159
hang around so I think promise something

762
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:35,600
special to still come when I even got a

763
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,809
different slide for it because I was

764
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,730
laughs excited so the idea was this week

765
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:41,960
because you know this was actually the

766
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,820
time I'm looking at this is the time I

767
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,549
spoke first second Amit's tried a little

768
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,799
bit longer why always do was trying to

769
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:50,720
talk about the trends that we uncovered

770
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,029
and that's where the industry is going

771
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,020
in terms of careers and where are the

772
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:59,659
opportunities around these so

773
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,490
essentially what I did was we

774
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:03,799
interviewed 30 people who in the first

775
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,409
few years of their careers or we're

776
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:07,760
still at university thanks and for those

777
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:10,640
that you do that you respond there's one

778
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,500
in the room I think and I have two to

779
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,909
the third point I really have to thank

780
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,440
such a great challenge they actually did

781
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,880
quite a lot of the research for me I

782
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,380
went to them and said you have a big

783
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,250
database doing a lot some more answering

784
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,710
questions for me

785
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,270
so asking six questions based on the

786
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,740
findings from the research how effects

787
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,539
in skills training opportunities and

788
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,789
there's a subsequent winter there

789
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:31,210
they're white hat community and they've

790
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:34,940
actually gave me current majority of the

791
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,679
the statute about to see so these are

792
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,149
the these the new stats that's the first

793
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,299
time today I actually can finish these

794
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:42,590
two days ago and if I do this talk again

795
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,910
in future I'm going to try and keep

796
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,280
boosting this if we get a number

797
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:49,130
oh actually we can talk to in the front

798
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,270
increase some of the responses so if you

799
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,370
have anyone who might be issued and

800
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,800
talking to me then you let me know so

801
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,629
the first question asked are you ready

802
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,389
to deal with malware the full question

803
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:02,030
actually asked was bearing in mind tech

804
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,160
troubles was top finding we hear reports

805
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,230
about merit detection banking Trojans

806
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,490
ranks somewhere do you feel be ready to

807
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,280
deal with these sorts of threats from

808
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:13,940
the work you've done from the 30 26

809
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,940
people answered this question and close

810
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:20,600
split slightly airing on the yes to the

811
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,920
positive to the notes the negative and I

812
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,990
do realize the personas don't add up

813
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,520
don't worry about that it's 50 so should

814
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,280
be slightly higher that'll be fifty

815
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,540
eight percent so yeah majority did come

816
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,000
back and actually say quite positive

817
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,010
things actually so I say positively I'll

818
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,030
show you some of the quotes we've got

819
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,950
there will be more to become in these

820
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:41,870
spaces it's become routine day-to-day

821
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:45,200
background operation yeah wow that's

822
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:48,169
quite quite damning really absolutely no

823
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,490
idea how to respond so I can see these

824
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,260
the condoms like why put these isn't it

825
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,940
family it was for a yes or no which made

826
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,930
like very easy some of these ones I have

827
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,580
to read them a little bit and say you

828
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,920
saying this is positive or negative I

829
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,720
can't quite figure it out after attack

830
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,400
by covering it's probably I've been

831
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,230
probably an impossible task so not be

832
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,780
yeah there is a fourth one even though I

833
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,010
magically I supervise give me an hour to

834
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,750
deal with these types of threats

835
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,980
efficiently so again these all these

836
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,320
people that where she was talking zoom

837
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:19,070
here all kind of still a student level

838
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,540
or still kind of just just starting the

839
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,310
career is no kind of career see so is

840
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,510
answering these questions so I thought

841
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,790
this is interesting to actually put this

842
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,080
out there because if technology is the

843
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,460
problem and these people are going to be

844
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,470
on you know 10 years time going to be

845
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,610
our cybersecurity leaders how good are

846
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,440
they actually dealing with these and if

847
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,870
they're actually just saying I learned a

848
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,060
graduate education every serve has been

849
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,219
through these so that's really positive

850
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,560
it means that that problem of technology

851
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,510
being and detection issues being a real

852
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,399
tricky one are actually going to go back

853
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:51,320
down again so I thought that's quite

854
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,900
positive next one so cloud even though

855
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,059
it didn't come in top-five he did come

856
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:59,429
in and it sort of the top 5 last year

857
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,139
and was a lower trend this year so the

858
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:02,940
full question I asked was card remains a

859
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:05,459
popular part of cybersecurity especially

860
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,809
with this year AWS so is there enough

861
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,690
training on how to work with these as a

862
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:14,668
service options we've got 26 people at

863
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:18,059
the 30 responded to this no liming yeah

864
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:20,419
so no negative tip 69% 18 of them said

865
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:22,499
no swing through some of the answers

866
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:27,269
probably available people just don't

867
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:28,769
take it thanks the Ivy needs to how they

868
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:30,450
weren't quite completely and that is

869
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:32,639
tough unless using as part of job roles

870
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,440
we don't do cloud then why would you

871
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:36,119
learn about it well the other probably

872
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,980
is because you might do in the future

873
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:40,168
but if you're not doing it day to day

874
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,730
maybe I'm trying to get to here is our

875
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:44,009
universities actually tackling these

876
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:47,580
issues to a level that's really going to

877
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:50,669
be suitable methods of learning is

878
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,139
through personal research so yeah if you

879
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:53,639
stuff is out there and actually I did

880
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:56,490
ask for some records I'll get to

881
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:57,840
recommendations on things you could look

882
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,580
at if you are looking to learn a bit

883
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,490
more one was SkillSoft

884
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,259
a Louisville is a cloud guru they're the

885
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,730
two that came in of people who actually

886
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,440
gave recommendations on the thing they'd

887
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:12,330
had had actually works we went into the

888
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,399
cloud so so that's one next one is so

889
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,220
this MOU compliance so came in third

890
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,830
this year first last year so I said are

891
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,169
you aware of the demands of Primo's gdpr

892
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,689
PCI DSS PSD to and other compliance

893
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:25,499
frameworks what they mean and how

894
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,340
they're different

895
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:32,759
so from this year 25 people answer this

896
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,330
and actually really quite positive 20

897
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,679
people 80% of them were said yes

898
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,658
only five were actually negative it's

899
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,179
probably cuz my same ISO read some up

900
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,980
John on gdpr with all those emails we

901
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,379
got saying how you teamed up and find we

902
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,279
on click this box to be gdpr compliant

903
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:52,408
and PCI has been a bit prevalent PSD to

904
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,269
I'll get to in just a second but plenty

905
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:59,639
of guidance material available if you're

906
00:32:54,269 --> 00:33:01,799
not to be comfortable with them I love

907
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:03,209
them no I feel in the university there's

908
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,889
lack of education around these topics

909
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,049
while often at conferences is spoken

910
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:09,300
about a lot it was last year GDP alma

911
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:12,030
they're everywhere in the last two years

912
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,790
I remember Cole giving a talk a couple

913
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:17,040
years ago on it and this was this one I

914
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:19,500
love right I've not heard of PSD to who

915
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,950
hit the PSD - well thank you - a couple

916
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,810
of hands please do come talk to me I'm

917
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,850
trying to I'll ask - about PSD to the -

918
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,560
not trying to figure it out it's yeah

919
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,360
payment services directive and actually

920
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,909
does part of the directive on trying to

921
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,850
money articles in it is actually be

922
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:38,280
compliant with gdpr

923
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,230
right so PSD - there's some stuff in

924
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,810
there about authentication this and

925
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,340
stuff in there about basic privacy but

926
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:48,330
ultimately it's about trying to reduce

927
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:50,760
fraud in the payment services sector so

928
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,710
PSP - I think while it's not a security

929
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,680
thing it's got lots of security in the

930
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,960
mouths of 90 to 100 in the articles of

931
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,730
that so maybe something to keep an eye

932
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,930
on actually if you're interested in

933
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,850
complying for learning a bit more about

934
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,190
it as PSD - I said I'm trying to tackle

935
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,030
this so feature and keep an eye on what

936
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,639
I'll be writing about possibly

937
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:13,350
publishing something on PSD - so we've

938
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,029
profiled and compliance asked would you

939
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,980
expect a company to train you in those

940
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,149
skills needed for compliance in cloud if

941
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,070
you're going to work with those two

942
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:21,899
things in particular are you actually

943
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,990
learning these now or would you expect

944
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:29,250
to learn on the job as it were so 27 of

945
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:30,750
the 30 arms of this and yes we do expect

946
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,270
a company to trainers for those skills

947
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,190
only first it know so just some of the

948
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,780
comments yes if there's a business

949
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,100
requirement to do so so if you actually

950
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,929
weren't doing this as part of your

951
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,889
day-to-day job then maybe it's not

952
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:43,500
something you would actually think

953
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:44,819
that's something I need to do we should

954
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,989
be ashamed having me it's nice to learn

955
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,419
stuff as you go along

956
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:51,529
and technically sure to practice work

957
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:53,520
paper training if they don't have to so

958
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,750
any that's a shame as well if you don't

959
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,240
actually have the companies coming to

960
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,470
you saying you know actually do this

961
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,790
kind of thing actually you know we're

962
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,319
gonna train you to do this stuff and how

963
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:05,550
prepared can you be for the future and

964
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,200
that's pretending jobs if I train to

965
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,940
helping you employees grown areas that

966
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,799
their job well we're better Phil I love

967
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,210
you love it if I don't if there is me

968
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,290
really couldn't compliance training out

969
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,580
that there probably is there's probably

970
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:19,170
training out there from them so how is

971
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,069
school going or anyone like that or even

972
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,630
some of the sort of

973
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,490
big for us on that note they provide

974
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,740
training but look still it'd be really

975
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,270
good for these are things I did wonder

976
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,470
how many universities are actually not

977
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:32,050
be a separate server but in future

978
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,330
actually I need the most is a training

979
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,790
compliance in cloud and actually going

980
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:39,339
out and training you in how to do data

981
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:42,089
protection and how to do business

982
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:44,740
compliance and how to do do security in

983
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:45,490
containerization who knows I might be

984
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,319
something will occur in the future

985
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:51,160
actually says quite a good way to maybe

986
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:53,680
look at the way things are going and I

987
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,410
think come up this is the last question

988
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,649
or not this is something we see quite a

989
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:01,569
lot of stories about how jobs basically

990
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,820
require unachievable levels of

991
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,800
experience and qualifications I've

992
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,970
written a really good blog I think

993
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,080
reading it last night at least earlier

994
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:13,660
on today with Daniel mice learn Isla Mei

995
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,069
SSL er who wrote an article about this

996
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,509
which I'd say from Twitter which was all

997
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,580
about these kind of miss hiring

998
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,220
misalignment really good actually but

999
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,799
also look at myself as reports on how

1000
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,299
the level of expectation of people to be

1001
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,040
kind of rock stars from day one just

1002
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,450
just never going to be fulfilled because

1003
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,750
that's the level of cybersecurity we're

1004
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:35,669
at now so the question yeah are you

1005
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:38,710
seeing job ads and 27 responded to this

1006
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,660
so slightly more negative idea negative

1007
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,980
in that yes we are seeing this kind of

1008
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,430
thing as this is a problem

1009
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,380
so therefore require degrees which many

1010
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:50,080
people kept with many capable people

1011
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,330
lack I won't response by the way from US

1012
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,980
and UK so probably slightly more leaning

1013
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,420
towards the UK than the US but a couple

1014
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,119
of people I did talk to work from out an

1015
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:00,970
American University but yeah this is the

1016
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,020
problem if you are if your company and

1017
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,790
you're trying to hire and you're only

1018
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,830
looking at you know qualifications of

1019
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:09,730
degree level you might be missing out to

1020
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:11,290
that's really really good recruiters and

1021
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,720
industry don't know what they want or

1022
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,490
need if they're not actually figuring

1023
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,290
out what the role is and if it's a

1024
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:20,229
certain aptitude likely to talk about

1025
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:23,020
this hiring misalignment in the human

1026
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,609
factor finding if you can't figure this

1027
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,869
out actually that's a real problem if

1028
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,450
you don't really know what it is you

1029
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,109
need feel that sort of aptitude for

1030
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,430
investigation you could fit with someone

1031
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,770
going into in response and that's a

1032
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,419
really good way forward but if HR are

1033
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,100
kind of being

1034
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,810
I'm blocker in the middle that doesn't

1035
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:41,250
get through that's a better problem for

1036
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:42,420
your business really and always virginia

1037
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,010
rolls they want them to the security

1038
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,140
ninjas straight out of uni and pay them

1039
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,450
entry-level wages I'm sure many people

1040
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,710
who can probably resonate with that

1041
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:53,100
there is this kind of cyber security

1042
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:56,040
ninja rock star elements a society now

1043
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,020
and we can't really get past that

1044
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,250
without kind of anyone really taking a

1045
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,440
chance on new people who everyone's

1046
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,060
trying to hire everybody wants a job but

1047
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,200
this even that little bit that's a real

1048
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,720
problem so yeah it's a problem and I

1049
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,480
know that cysts co SS p does require

1050
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,100
five years experience and if your job ad

1051
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,650
is requiring and sudden present has a

1052
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,700
cyst qualification that's when the

1053
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,920
problems going to be clearly in five

1054
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,270
years experience my friend Ivy

1055
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,130
University initially got really good

1056
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,420
placement which did she could disappear

1057
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,740
for five years

1058
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,120
what and there was one more question

1059
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,879
stick with me so a lot all the

1060
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,350
statistics hope this suit quite useful

1061
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,120
i've communication presentation skills

1062
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:38,370
being taught or encouraged to a level

1063
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,549
that you're comfortable with i felt down

1064
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,380
actually a cybersecurity challenge

1065
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,060
conference last year on the panel so

1066
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,250
it's really like my saw that he was

1067
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,810
presenting today and the reason that

1068
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,340
reason that that's the reason I asked is

1069
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,170
I thought oh but he actually very one

1070
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:56,100
that board engagement claiming in our

1071
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:58,710
fourth place in our top top five are we

1072
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,420
ready for this kind of level of a person

1073
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,850
to go up in front of boards in front of

1074
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,200
CEOs in front of customers even and be

1075
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,970
able to present to the level that

1076
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,460
they're actually comfortable with so I

1077
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,109
thought let's ask them and they're

1078
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,890
pretty split as you can see twenty-five

1079
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:15,330
people answered and I guess hopefully

1080
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,490
what's going on is the people are

1081
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:20,610
presenting in front of hacking societies

1082
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,319
in front of DEFCON groups if you're

1083
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,430
involved with those kind of things you

1084
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,990
know just a little things where you can

1085
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,339
start out in front of your peers even

1086
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,290
keep doing from your main and you can

1087
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,500
still start in there and work your way

1088
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,730
up but just some of the comments that

1089
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,720
hasn't been taught what you're saying

1090
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,950
cuz if you're not getting people to come

1091
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,689
up be prepared to be able to speak in

1092
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:40,950
front of them in just your own sort

1093
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:42,570
class then that's a bit of a shame being

1094
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,310
part of having these abilities and be

1095
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,930
comfortable to present which that's

1096
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,330
positive actually the people feel their

1097
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:51,430
ease

1098
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:53,140
that is going on and can put yourself in

1099
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,430
a professional manner obviously don't

1100
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,920
get yourself in an unprofessional manner

1101
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,750
and it's a fight for success in any

1102
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,040
organization it's a real way we're going

1103
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,140
to get forward with the industry is

1104
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,460
actually being not only giving new

1105
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,930
people opportunities but obviously

1106
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,910
getting them prepared for all the

1107
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,440
opportunities that are out there and the

1108
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,950
ones that they can actually then you

1109
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,270
know right along with so I mean that's

1110
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,830
kind of the end of that this was a new

1111
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,970
bit then so as I said we're going to be

1112
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,930
rolling this on soar through the yoke

1113
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,250
through the next few months I'm gonna

1114
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,859
probably be presenting this again in

1115
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,090
September another event we're trying get

1116
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,560
these numbers up we'll try and maybe

1117
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,540
push to savannah reach a few more people

1118
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,710
you might be and I did email said

1119
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,320
they're promised they'll come back to me

1120
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,310
so yeah that's something to be doing

1121
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,480
about how I'm gonna be right about this

1122
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,470
as well so I hope you'll be reading a

1123
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,120
little bit more on these stats because

1124
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,919
important for me to know how we're a

1125
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,080
leading name in the next generation of

1126
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,790
cybersecurity professionals because if

1127
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,500
we just kind of rely on who we know now

1128
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,570
and they're all getting as old as I am

1129
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,070
then we're going to kind of get to a

1130
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,540
stage where actually with the pipeline

1131
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:54,340
is it's just not going to work as weak

1132
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:56,940
as we desired so I'm kind of almost done

1133
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,410
actually so these were just some of the

1134
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,810
takeaways as far as I could sort of take

1135
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,279
from the the overall research techsoup's

1136
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:07,210
an issue more people feel comfortable

1137
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,160
dealing with now or an instance but that

1138
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,410
sort of it was almost confliction there

1139
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,779
but detectives an issue but our new

1140
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,100
next-gen research says people are

1141
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,360
comfortable dealing with malware so

1142
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,830
maybe that is actually something that's

1143
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,710
a problem now that won't be a problem in

1144
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:23,440
the future

1145
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,880
compliance is never present but people

1146
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,920
are aware and the frameworks it's not

1147
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,250
something that's alien is compliance and

1148
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,290
gdpr and data protection and definitely

1149
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,670
so all the different ones it's something

1150
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,400
that is people are aware of and they're

1151
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,690
actually getting a handle on well it's

1152
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,920
not sort of like threading clouds and

1153
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,630
they were present but more training is

1154
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,520
needed I think that kind of and Sony

1155
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,020
understood that and yeah I believe the

1156
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,630
hype on automation

1157
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,610
so yeah automation it goes away and I

1158
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,580
feel that this is automation heavy it

1159
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:53,740
quickly was today but that's what that's

1160
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,480
the feedback we got so I think you know

1161
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:58,450
this was something we did this year and

1162
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,500
I was quite delighted when you still

1163
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,029
come so yes please do

1164
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,340
pretend this because I mean I could find

1165
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:07,030
some new stuff to talk about slow just

1166
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:09,100
to wrap up then this is the website you

1167
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:11,650
download the full report in first -

1168
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,880
magazine comm slash white papers if you

1169
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,580
want to tweet me there's my Twitter

1170
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,350
there's my email and that's info

1171
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,180
security makes Twitter that's the new

1172
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,200
issue on the right hand side you can get

1173
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,730
out on the website as well it's all

1174
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,049
available and we also put stuff up we

1175
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,700
don't do any payrolls when we do a

1176
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,940
logging more PFF accounts and download

1177
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,430
it but that's free as well so with that

1178
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:58,120
I think I'm done any question is that

1179
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:59,950
yes there is yeah there is an element of

1180
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:04,170
that I think so far this year I feel

1181
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:06,669
like I've done visibility cyber hygiene

1182
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,380
those those have been much more

1183
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,180
prominent this year actually we I've

1184
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,860
just been talking to ever kind actually

1185
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,799
about DNS security which nothing has

1186
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:19,120
been quite prominent is used in DNS but

1187
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,560
I was trying to eat would love people

1188
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,690
putting those people in from first base

1189
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,430
yes saying I'm say what sort of thing is

1190
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,080
he talking about and he said red teaming

1191
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,879
social engineering bug bounties no more

1192
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,500
one of them he's been in 12 top ten

1193
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,670
actually didn't like I'll tell you was

1194
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,720
that but that was our trend that's it

1195
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,040
month up to do more on those but

1196
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,569
ultimately that's not what the audience

1197
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,640
seemed to be resonating with so yeah I

1198
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,440
feel greedy actually compliance was you

1199
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,859
know huge last year I made a point of

1200
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,390
like hit 2015 mode Jesse was a Friday I

1201
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,160
said let's just stop I'm just sick of

1202
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:52,600
right of our GDP I did GDP are from its

1203
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:54,879
inception in 2012 that last year you

1204
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,580
mean it was it was cream trapper you

1205
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,180
know we're sort of you know where we go

1206
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,470
when you're creating content using

1207
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,660
what's going to make people click and

1208
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:07,209
not be able to look at you can go out

1209
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,640
and you can you know for example some

1210
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:11,380
subjects don't resonate so well and I'm

1211
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,879
not so much for in high security but

1212
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,730
when they see I did this and I found

1213
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,259
when people talked about like you know

1214
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,789
criminal convictions you know people

1215
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:20,680
being arrested hardly with any interest

1216
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,690
didn't put any effort in when we know

1217
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,098
sorts always going around but no I do

1218
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,740
agree I think air people are talking

1219
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:30,519
about these subjects a lot more but it's

1220
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,319
a case of are we driving it yeah we took

1221
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:34,479
every viewing dependently I took a bit

1222
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,960
of a cross-section of people in the

1223
00:44:34,480 --> 00:45:41,769
industry as well and the general

1224
00:44:37,960 --> 00:45:44,140
consensus you know issues and G is

1225
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:49,328
possible in the way and thinking when

1226
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:55,839
this death many people movement along

1227
00:45:49,329 --> 00:46:00,670
people that team are running in yeah I

1228
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,390
agree I was only talking to do not get

1229
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,059
heard that you're back

1230
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,490
Johan was until he retired the SVP and

1231
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:07,420
security at Google and I said I'll turn

1232
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,649
to them and I said you know how are you

1233
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,119
getting on with higher and grand on

1234
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:11,920
Google there but everybody wants to work

1235
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,660
be said I'll be I've got fifty bacon C's

1236
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,549
on I'm trying to hire for 50-plus spots

1237
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,288
and I'm like this was in Palo Alto in

1238
00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:18,730
California and I'm like how are you

1239
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:21,269
struggling exact you've got major

1240
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:23,470
universities in this area all doing this

1241
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:25,390
so and you know I've read these stories

1242
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,390
about people you know sending a shoe in

1243
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,480
a box to Google

1244
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:33,558
but my foot in the door hilarious and so

1245
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:35,660
the you know but I mean yeah I get from

1246
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,339
pretty much a seesaw Google that they

1247
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,990
can't hire anybody that they're not able

1248
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:40,519
to fill their position so I do agree

1249
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,348
with you I'll actually be great about

1250
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:44,479
being on transparency cuz I mean when

1251
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:45,859
one of us apply for our jobs ourselves

1252
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,500
and find out how many people got through

1253
00:46:45,859 --> 00:46:50,779
to final interview I bet no one knows

1254
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,160
and I'll bet waiting when we get the job

1255
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:54,349
we try to find out the bosses don't sell

1256
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,670
ours like yeah it's a funny one that's

1257
00:46:54,349 --> 00:47:16,160
get are you gonna question and I look to

1258
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:17,779
more great yeah thank you I probably

1259
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,339
wouldn't touch the state of

1260
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:20,869
cybersecurity until we reach we redo it

1261
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,009
in 2020 but in terms of the next gen

1262
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:22,910
stuff definitely will definitely

1263
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,769
increase there because that's something

1264
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,269
that can be ongoing and we take better

1265
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:27,649
questions cuz I came up those questions

1266
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:37,008
as well my main thing I'm doing right

1267
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:39,289
she once I laid in back yet I will drive

1268
00:47:37,009 --> 00:47:40,970
that so that was done I spoke to my book

1269
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,529
bill buddington work for the FF and I

1270
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,669
said what do you think is the driver

1271
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:46,160
side she needs a certificate

1272
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:49,099
transparency that's around my brows to

1273
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,140
sit browser certificates and say so I

1274
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,730
think if I see a level stuff like that

1275
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,839
so things like yeah when he says him he

1276
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:58,819
said that but but no one else will

1277
00:47:53,839 --> 00:48:01,640
mention that so yeah and I think that

1278
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:03,019
kind of the what was the story I heard

1279
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,930
from risky business the other day

1280
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:07,339
someone trying to get coming between was

1281
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,558
they were saying about some company

1282
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:13,150
trying to get to be a root CA now and

1283
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:13,150
that kind of thing I think that's

1284
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,050
[Music]

1285
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,330
[Music]

1286
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:50,069

1287
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:58,440

1288

00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:05,760
I knew once when you happen to hit it

1291
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,819
would be interesting for you in several

1292
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,880
surveys because now their minds of

1293
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:21,980
people that Co Ltd ain't moving up as

1294
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:27,270
wearing a properly sized fingers yeah

1295
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:32,460
surprised them had a survey of our

1296
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:33,420
offices okay I can look back I might add

1297
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,329
this my next presentation

1298

1301
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,109

1302
00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:47,220
add a few more cuts in places so and

1303
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:50,180
John oh I wish gonna ask you I mean

1304
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:55,950
mention devices big yet issue that's

1305
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:58,859
okay how wasting things to prepare a

1306
00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:01,819
wider company because what's happening

1307
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:12,690
inside is chosen you know things like

1308
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:14,700
lunch and outsourcing which nation you

1309
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:25,319
know he's like crazy but I also

1310
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:29,009
previously in terms of what happens like

1311
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:40,500
society yeah I mean it's a relationship

1312
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:44,010
to what's going on other policies talk

1313
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,930
about your bed I love my sure to be I

1314
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,760
think yeah I mean obviously II can look

1315
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,649
at for example all my wife and we

1316
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,940
Cambridge analytical and what's

1317
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,170
happening with election hacking in terms

1318
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,150
of how society is

1319
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:57,400
becoming part of some security fun part

1320
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:59,769
of society and vice-versa but I think

1321
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,599
overall in yeah so day to day job I mean

1322
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:04,508
one of the things that came up I think

1323
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:07,390
you know I lowered single responses

1324
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:09,099
government intervention I mean that was

1325
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:12,549
along the lines of election hacking and

1326
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:15,940
policy stuff Robinson and nation-state

1327
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:18,869
stuff so yeah I think that's pitching

1328
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:23,559
more tax we might see something like an

1329
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:32,160
onion picture to see how how know the

1330
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:32,160
price of cryptocurrency become actually

1331
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:51,160
then that kind of described down getting

1332
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:53,319
more pics of my family practice in the

1333
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:58,328
wider economy yeah and we've got the

1334
00:51:53,319 --> 00:52:02,799
policy yeah I think we'll be able to

1335
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:04,749
share about that yeah sorry it's go back

1336
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:06,190
to GDP on oh no it's a previous no

1337
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:08,319
problem no problem I'm sick of it

1338
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:10,239
there's bit specifically new things that

1339
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,549
have happened recently naming creating

1340
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,190
my I know it's still fairly recent do

1341
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:17,049
you think the fines levied by the ICL do

1342
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,609
you feel this is enough person from what

1343
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:21,339
you're seeing what will here in because

1344
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:23,650
even with the amounts being at this one

1345
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:25,479
percent fines divided and they the IC

1346
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,640
o---- being allowed to levy a maximum of

1347
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:29,319
four percent yeah which is the moment

1348
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,629
7 percent that group level of their

1349
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:34,029
total profit I think it was but is it

1350
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:36,880
kind of enough to force and not to just

1351
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:38,380
taking strikes on operating costs well I

1352
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,089
think the two things they're a likable

1353
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,930
one is its intention to point I'm

1354
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:42,549
wanting to even happen

1355
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:45,489
number two is it could probably will get

1356
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:47,499
appealed yeah I hadn't realized it was

1357
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:48,880
only 1% until someone pointed out to me

1358
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:50,558
and it was like blimey yeah actually

1359
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,079
think about that because the first thing

1360
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,999
i think god that's a lot of money

1361
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,099
the milk with cambridge Ella lexico

1362
00:52:54,999 --> 00:53:00,038
which they a 5k measurement ability and

1363
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:01,779
a half a million maximum so 180 million

1364
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:04,350
thinking blinding that's a big deal also

1365
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:07,530
the thing about be a Mary is I kind of

1366
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:11,120
forgotten about the middle way the thing

1367
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:13,710
about BAE was a mage carving which

1368
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,529
Saskia's talked earlier on mention that

1369
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:19,740
and cause quite a few people hit by mage

1370
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:21,930
cart so Ticketmaster and then some

1371
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:24,299
others an upcoming room tomorrow I made

1372
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:25,589
a cake let's get it wrong but yeah a few

1373
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,610
others so you think actually they all

1374
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,340
now see they're quaking in their boots

1375
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:30,540
going up liming we're next for this but

1376
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,250
yeah I think that you went down you're

1377
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,840
right 1% some people might think

1378
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,990
actually you know disaffected are lots

1379
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,310
of people and you think like Equifax is

1380
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,080
that going to be next are all these

1381
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:42,779
paper at my cox-1 because that was

1382
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,670
before 2018 but from now on it's almost

1383
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,880
like it took so we're going we now a

1384
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:49,500
July May 14 months for us or GDP are to

1385
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,540
kind of come round to fruition so those

1386
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,360
quotes I put up there has it lived up a

1387
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,310
table which came in like dents or munch

1388
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,200
yeah rot for four months and is back on

1389
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,580
our minds again so yeah truth be told

1390
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,100
actually I agree with you I think Robbie

1391
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:06,420
might be 1% wasn't enough but actually

1392
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:11,279
it's yeah do you go 4% just as a

1393
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:13,320
statement kind of firing away yeah

1394
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,700
absolutely yeah there was suspicions

1395
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,890
that would be the cases like that show

1396
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:21,649
how hard we really are but the fact that

1397
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,650
be a was double what Marius was almost

1398
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:56,430
for the first thing was 60 people and

1399
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:58,290
well the next gen stuff I actually

1400
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,629
talked to 30 people but not ever be

1401
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,980
responded to every questions so when I

1402
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,360
try and filled out by trying gates with

1403
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,500
like a round number for every answer

1404
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,820
kind of thing so yeah they were all with

1405
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,350
industry yeah I've gotta decide which I

1406
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,630
can show you which was yelling was like

1407
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:16,348
a lot of stuff since CEO as there was in

1408
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:18,700
VCS there were some analysts researchers

1409
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:19,930
yeah it's Liberty didn't go if you don't

1410
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,430
know the deployed equipment stammers

1411
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,629
report you'll see who's in there but

1412
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,598
you'll see see I said a lot of people

1413
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:27,339
very familiar and I think I think that

1414
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,329
once you give me in one minute so really

1415
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:30,599
thanks to everybody for come this has

1416
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:30,599
been great
