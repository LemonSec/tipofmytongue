1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,840
hi everybody I'm Stewart smiles and nice

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,730
to meet you all

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:16,860
I'd like to talk to you about people

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:19,290
networking so I was looking at it from

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,360
an information security perspective and

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,830
I was looking at breaches and things

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,470
like that and I'll give you that

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,779
presentation in a second but what I was

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,720
thinking about is how can you get the

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,560
message about security out to across an

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,079
organization so what I've tried to do is

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,570
take a presentation about getting the

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,230
message across and delivering that

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,350
message as well so it's off it might end

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:55,260
up as a bit of a DDoS attack but it's in

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:57,480
terms of people so me I these are the

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,780
things I like I asking questions I like

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,000
trying to find answers I think about

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,929
thinking attitude and behavior and how

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,209
we change that management systems I used

21
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:11,009
to do you should work for a company

22
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,469
where I did have the involvement with

23
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:16,950
health and safety as well and previously

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,779
did network security I want to convince

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,469
people to do right things for the right

26
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:24,298
reasons I like something called the five

27
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,399
why's I don't know if everyone's heard

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,729
about it but the idea that if you ask

29
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:32,279
why five times you get to somewhere near

30
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,908
the answer it might not be five it might

31
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:37,529
be seven it might be ten but you're

32
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,909
going in the direction of why

33
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:43,979
something's happened I like continuous

34
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,689
improvements and I like using carrots

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,369
rather than stick so I'm trying to get

36
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,408
away from what is what is a good way of

37
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,539
convincing this somebody to do something

38
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,489
rather than saying well fear fear fear

39
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:02,340
you're going to get fine to death but

40
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:07,049
maybe the answer is to use the fit fine

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:11,520
to death to create a motivation to get

42
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:14,220
better I'm doing at the moment it's for

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
my Master's dissertation the original

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,890
one I wrote

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,820
I wasn't academic enough because I'm not

46
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,100
very academic in that respect I tried to

47
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,070
find an answer to a question of how much

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,620
people get fined

49
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,720
and that wasn't academic because it

50
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,740
didn't involve too much academic

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,420
literature I used to work for a

52
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,360
university organization I'm looking for

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,269
a new job and I'd like people to

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:52,720
volunteer to participate in my little

55
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:56,560
research project and contact me so who

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,010
maybe with interaction we can get people

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,700
to actually talk within the organization

58
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,489
about security maybe through using that

59
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,709
interaction on regular occasions we can

60
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,600
get people bought into the idea that

61
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,540
maybe only to give this a little more

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:17,320
attention than I previously do so if

63
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,660
I've got the presentation of this is

64
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,000
security this is important this is how

65
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,950
we could do it better maybe we could

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,290
have a list of what's important to us

67
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,500
and then get some ownership and

68
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,239
accountability within the organization

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,000
how many times does the appropriate

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,180
person need to hear that before they buy

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,190
into it and is there a way that we could

72
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,100
possibly accelerate the time scale

73
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,930
between like getting the messages and

74
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:50,380
then getting better and getting to yet

75
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,860
so how do we get to get better basics or

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,269
better security aspects to our

77
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,480
organization how do we get there faster

78
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:02,200
how do we convert them from maybe if not

79
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,238
bought in so yes I'm engaged or yes I

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,940
want to ask these questions of my

81
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,510
internal people so I'm trying to

82
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,820
influence that sort of decision so what

83
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,250
I'm thinking and this is what I'm going

84
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,548
to try and do is if I get the right

85
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,339
content here and I give that content to

86
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:23,770
everybody and I get them to interact

87
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,799
with each other across the organization

88
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,159
could those people then have influence

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,190
within the

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,680
Arup area of the organization could we

91
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,560
get more people and more interaction

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,410
across that organization so that the

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,640
person that holds the purse strings

94
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,880
decides this is something I want to

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,390
focus some attention on could we draw

96
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:51,020
that time away from other activities

97
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,610
towards security or make it part of the

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,729
normal things that they're asking for

99
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,570
could we make life easy because if we

100
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,210
make life easy

101
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,099
perhaps that would encourage people to

102
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:05,630
say you know what this is something I

103
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:08,300
want to do more so why do I need a

104
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,980
better Network how do I build it and

105
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,950
what are my objectives in this

106
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,130
particular case my objective is to

107
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,390
answer a question of how do we get

108
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,420
organizations to buy into better

109
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:25,039
security how do we get them to say oh

110
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:27,500
this is important to me so if that's

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,890
what we're looking to achieve how can we

112
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,770
get there well it's obvious to me that

113
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,750
by telling everybody what the message is

114
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,310
and getting them all to talk about it

115
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,720
then hopefully that'll get some more

116
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,490
mindshare and how by doing that and

117
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,680
showing them the tools then maybe

118
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,480
they'll come back with yes here we are

119
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:54,950
we've got some we're with it so can we

120
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,110
get better data and better decisions as

121
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:00,500
a result of people actually thinking

122
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,660
more about securities my problem rather

123
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:09,500
than its somebody else's are we've got a

124
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:12,500
team that I t deal with it and then how

125
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,700
could we get better information to the

126
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:19,250
decision maker and then use maybe the

127
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,950
case study from this week of BA and Mary

128
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,230
it in order to say well this is

129
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,990
something we we previously were taking

130
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,810
seriously I'm sure but maybe we could do

131
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,380
more maybe it's now got a heightened

132
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,840
impact because of what the the

133
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,729
likelihood of it being a significant

134
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,469
risk to the organization because the

135
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,688
monetary penalties are significantly

136
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,889
higher maybe it's more in

137
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:48,979
tactful so another thing is which

138
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:51,349
company are you at now nd would you

139
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:55,188
guess that they're likely to have an

140
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:56,869
impact in the next 12 months because

141
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,669
then you think well okay if they're

142
00:06:56,869 --> 00:07:01,429
going to have an impact in the next 12

143
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,498
months because of a breach then do I

144
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:06,589
need my action plan for where I'm going

145
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:09,439
to go next because the impacts of the

146
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:11,719
breach are so significant that there

147
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,849
will be impacts to it and would they be

148
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:17,179
likely to affect me in that security

149
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:19,369
team it may be a positive impact in

150
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:21,739
terms of I've got more work to do I've

151
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:24,110
got this to do I've got that to do but

152
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:26,839
where would you go next is there a

153
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,509
sufficient critical mass of roles in my

154
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,099
area I don't live in London I'm not in

155
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:34,519
Redding I'm in the northeast of England

156
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:39,110
so would that role drop at the relevant

157
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:43,069
time that you want to move if moving is

158
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,559
part of that and and will organisations

159
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:48,529
look at you you know if you were the

160
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:50,959
person that was at organization X and

161
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:54,019
then you move how is that reputational

162
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,029
damage going to affect you and how would

163
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,399
you then take it further forward so

164
00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:02,599
you're gonna probably end up carrying

165
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:05,659
some of that on an ongoing basis so

166
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:08,839
again it's a question of well how do how

167
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:14,629
do I both isolate myself from an issue

168
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:16,550
but also protect myself going forward so

169
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,519
who do I know in a local organisation

170
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,099
how do I get more people have I got a

171
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,419
map so obviously is a networking person

172
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,209
you're always looking for a network

173
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,948
diagram and ideally a network diagram

174
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:30,709
that's been drawn on with the right

175
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:35,870
information because the diagrams always

176
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:38,259
out a date so and then how could I get

177
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:42,649
better network to the other

178
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:44,899
organizations within the area so maybe

179
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:48,889
if I do

180
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,589
accountants events Bank events IT events

181
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:54,259
and other things within the local area

182
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,910
we can get like traction between the

183
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,709
other things

184
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:03,410
maybe by deploying the payload stuff of

185
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,209
what I've got already we can get a

186
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:10,370
quickie yes to make the organization

187
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:13,369
where we are at more secure maybe it has

188
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,680
the conversation doesn't happen with one

189
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,600
particular person maybe it happens in

190
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,120
different areas at different times and

191
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:26,389
if we flood the organization with those

192
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,459
messages both internally and externally

193
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,649
to other organizations those

194
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:33,170
interactions which I have no control

195
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:42,680
over but they could perhaps persuade

196
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:44,899
people to do things that we want so how

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,930
many times do you think somebody has to

198
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:50,750
hear the message of change your password

199
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:53,508
it's important or alternatively a better

200
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,550
password or use last person or do

201
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,259
something differently how many times

202
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,589
would you have to say that before they

203
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:02,930
actually go oh yes maybe I will do that

204
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:07,699
is there a way that we can achieve and

205
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:10,849
getting to that faster and could we use

206
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:15,560
a DDoS type method in order to get

207
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:20,269
people to that place faster so if you

208
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,699
take that sort of idea of let's let's

209
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:25,699
get the message to someone to the server

210
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:28,699
in this case a person could we get them

211
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:30,769
involved quicker so that their response

212
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:34,339
is better so that they are more

213
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:36,620
protected so for example let's get them

214
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,120
using password managers now because the

215
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,389
passwords that they've got a better but

216
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,040
a better manage their better protected

217
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:46,819
could we do that with the spreadsheets

218
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:51,069
and the and the information that they've

219
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:53,839
got into inside their organization so um

220
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:57,800
one of the things apparently Ryanair

221
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,810
said was that Michael O'Leary got sick

222
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,389
to the back teeth of people going on

223
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,579
about customer service and wherever he

224
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,740
went whenever he went somewhere somebody

225
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,150
always had a SPAD story to tell him and

226
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,060
he decided as a result

227
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,640
this that he actually had to change the

228
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,920
way in which the customer service was

229
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,250
happening in order to stop these

230
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,579
interactions so it's like you a toddler

231
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:27,210
and pester power and I've got a daughter

232
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,640
who's three and she manages to get ice

233
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,020
cream when she wants because she just

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,240
says daddy I want ice cream

235
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,920
daddy I'm doing this this is what's

236
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,710
happening

237
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,709
maybe that approach of either repetition

238
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,990
or like a single-minded determination to

239
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,860
get what you want is the way in which we

240
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,980
can change the organisation and then

241
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,340
maybe with the aggregation of marginal

242
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,740
gains as with British Cycling we can use

243
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,620
those like minimal those increments in

244
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:08,430
every area to make the organization

245
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:10,770
significantly more secure so with

246
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,870
insurance companies they look at tale

247
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,630
data so they they can pretty much

248
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,730
accurately work out how much something's

249
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,800
going to cost them and then they can

250
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,480
actually forecast it so could we do the

251
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,300
same sort of thing in terms of their

252
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,460
claims data and if we've got that

253
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,650
average of how much it's going to cost

254
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,320
then we can actually anticipate what

255
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,060
their likely cost is going to be and

256
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:39,350
then we can forecast what we're going to

257
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:43,380
do about it mate with doing the events

258
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,660
Eventbrite obviously b-sides conferences

259
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,600
and things like that we can get a better

260
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,449
network across organizations and then

261
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:59,010
use that network in order to sell the

262
00:12:51,450 --> 00:13:02,010
security message so these the events

263
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,580
that I go to at the moment and where the

264
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:08,040
thing there will be equivalent events in

265
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,050
different areas and hopefully those

266
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,530
things mean that you can interact with

267
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,719
other people and get to different

268
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,610
organizations and save them well this is

269
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:23,100
something that's interesting would you

270
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:25,910
do it so I'm going to go to the actual

271
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,910
thing now

272
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:47,529
so if we what is an information security

273
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:51,160
challenge that you're dealing with at

274
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:53,079
the minute how and where does the job

275
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,649
set at the moment and where should it

276
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,989
sit

277
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,740
Israel way that you could actually take

278
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:02,079
that talk take that issue and then move

279
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,450
it across the organization to somewhere

280
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,479
else is there somewhere else that it

281
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,430
could be who shouldn't sit with and how

282
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,620
do you transfer is there a way to get

283
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:17,560
that moving to the right person so I did

284
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,620
a spreadsheet to assess how much is a

285
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:25,329
breach gonna cost what could be the

286
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:30,390
variables I used the IBM cost of benches

287
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:33,279
report the outcomes from the ICR website

288
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:37,120
Verizon's data breach investigation

289
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,160
reports and obviously twitter because

290
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,279
that's got everything up-to-date and

291
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:48,040
accurate on it the ICO vines that are

292
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,630
there and you can see on the website

293
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,949
table you see under action we've taken

294
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:56,170
in the enforcement and then we can

295
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:59,019
actually do some forecasting of what the

296
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,360
unknown unknowns are and then we can

297
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:04,360
look at what are the risks that we are

298
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,029
currently running and aren't accepted by

299
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,130
anyone because there's a lot of things

300
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,019
that people like forget about it or

301
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:20,800
assume that I've been dealt with by

302
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:23,550
somebody else so I'm using the principle

303
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,920
that sunshine is the best disinfectant

304
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,479
so if somebody goes around and says well

305
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,699
let's have a look at everything and

306
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,070
we've got a sheet that everyone uses

307
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:35,740
could that be good enough to allow us to

308
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,230
say well in this area we've done this in

309
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,260
this area we've done this there you go

310
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,360
happy days everyone uses the same data

311
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,339
and now in terms of security normally

312
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,110
everyone would say well you know what

313
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,760
it's security we don't tell anybody

314
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,250
about anything because that makes us

315
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,250
more secure but actually what it does is

316
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,530
it creates gaps where you expect that

317
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,450
area is doing something when actually

318
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:02,100
they're not or it's outside your scope

319
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:05,410
for this particular area so I created a

320
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,600
self-assessment checklist based on a

321
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,160
number of different things so maybe we

322
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,800
could say well these are the assets that

323
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,050
are important to us this is what the

324
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,449
investigation say so

325
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,829
Carphone Warehouse said that this this

326
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:21,750
and this are the things that are

327
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:25,330
important and in the report from the ICO

328
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,640
so the best data is probably within

329
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,880
those sorts of reports so it's gathering

330
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,680
what they've said and then how what

331
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,990
they're looking for and they cannot take

332
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,800
those things up in terms of you feedback

333
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:42,670
lis if you've got reinstatement or

334
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,979
reputation cost or RAM what we should

335
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,990
have done earlier but is now going to be

336
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,630
much more expensive because you know

337
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,910
what we've got to do it now we've got a

338
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,800
by consulting time we have to do it

339
00:16:51,910 --> 00:17:02,050
through the process that somebody else

340
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:05,109
is doing so what will make a marked

341
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,240
difference to the cost valuation of the

342
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,429
systems obviously if we look at the

343
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,310
things are important in terms of our

344
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,410
systems we can have a targeted effort on

345
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:19,659
those systems which increases our in

346
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:21,730
fact if we triangulate for what what's

347
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,949
significant then obviously we can say

348
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,130
well these the areas where people are

349
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:31,020
attacking so let's do those both we can

350
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:33,250
use an accident cost model and so

351
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,840
basically if spreadsheet and then how

352
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,320
much for each of these different items

353
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,879
and then we can go through the mill and

354
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,860
become better at doing the same things

355
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:48,100
time time again so I used some of this

356
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,379
is come from a document called GP g40 I

357
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,179
don't know if anyone's heard of it it's

358
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,480
about information security management

359
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:58,810
systems within the military and they've

360
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,380
got a really good table at the back on

361
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,419
XA which says what these things and then

362
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,180
in terms of maturity level how do I get

363
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,970
nil to optimize and then he

364
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:14,360
various boxes that you've got and then

365
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,610
how do we achieve movement so that sort

366
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,379
of set some standards as to what good

367
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:24,020
looks like this is the table it's

368
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,870
obviously unreadable on here but you can

369
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:31,430
see the sort of idea of well we've got

370
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:38,379
from mismanagement - everyone knows

371
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:40,970
what's going on and happy date this is a

372
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,410
link that I think is worth using

373
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:47,570
internally so on YouTube this is a video

374
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:51,830
from the data protection conference that

375
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,560
the ICO did and it's about board I don't

376
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,300
know if Sam would work on the

377
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,129
presentation thing because I haven't

378
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:04,700
tested it but what she's saying about is

379
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:07,670
accountability in the board so there's a

380
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:12,410
one about a question came from a guy

381
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:14,480
know Nationwide Building Society

382
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,520
I've got an engaged board that's great

383
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,240
what would you do if you didn't have

384
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,790
that and another one with four MHS -

385
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,710
said about I'm jealous of health and

386
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:29,389
safety legislation because it sets out

387
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,430
what the the way in which it works how

388
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,920
does that translate through to date

389
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,990
protection so she's got some really good

390
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,060
answers that you could then take and use

391
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,250
inside your own organization and put it

392
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,350
in front of the people get them together

393
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,170
give them some biscuits that sit in the

394
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,990
meeting room and say I'd like you to

395
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:52,010
have a look at this and see what see

396
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:55,130
what you say why max data well obviously

397
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,900
if you look at GDP I'll find everyone

398
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,080
had been saying well it's 2 to 4 percent

399
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,420
of global turnover I don't think anyone

400
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,939
had really anticipated that when the

401
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:09,110
fines came out this week they would be

402
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:12,980
as significant as they have been and now

403
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:16,179
that it's on the radar perhaps those but

404
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,520
that reality is going this over a few

405
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,860
well depends on what actually gets paid

406
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,999
but that reality is going to

407
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,168
I don't think it's likely that a lot of

408
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:29,029
companies are going to be in a position

409
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,820
to pay these funds so they're going to

410
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:36,440
have to force some sort of defense

411
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:40,908
mechanism at what and how do we expect

412
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:44,409
what it's likely to be so in terms of

413
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:46,820
mapping unknowns maybe from different

414
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,320
viewpoints we could turn around and say

415
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,019
well you know what I don't know exactly

416
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,509
what it is but if I look from this

417
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:55,789
viewpoint I can see it's something like

418
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:57,739
that if I look for this viewpoint

419
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,950
something like that and that one for

420
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:03,769
that so then an unknown gets quantified

421
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,450
to an extent and then gives you a

422
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,489
ballpark figure which you can turn

423
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:11,600
around so well you know what whilst it

424
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:14,289
may not be exact it still means we've

425
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,289
got to do something

426
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:21,350
maybe we can triangulate the things on

427
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:23,809
what's important as well so I started in

428
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,330
terms of the cases with a piece of paper

429
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,668
and said well okay what are the

430
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,428
categories of finds at the moment that

431
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:36,590
are significant and how do they group

432
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:41,210
together put a list together of the

433
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,869
various cases and looked at how much was

434
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,950
the fine

435
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:48,320
what was the area of what had happened

436
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:52,009
what was the issue who was it and how

437
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,739
much now obviously we're GDP are we know

438
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:57,409
that there's going to be a significant

439
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:59,179
uplift in what the quantum is but what

440
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:01,100
we can get from this is what the

441
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,960
categories are in terms of their

442
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,119
appetite for how much we're going to

443
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,549
find you what we're going to do and then

444
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,499
if we take those we can translate them

445
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:12,799
across to when we know what the new

446
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:15,470
figures are going to be so this was for

447
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,230
Pecha notices and you can see a grouping

448
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,659
error around this level there's a

449
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:28,580
grouping at this level and then there's

450
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:32,389
some big one so that means that if we

451
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:35,629
look at what they are you're going to be

452
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:38,719
in a thinner range so you can't

453
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:41,240
to pay what those Rangers might be so I

454
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,010
anticipate those Rangers you can say

455
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,220
well okay what are we going to do about

456
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:50,570
them so how do we how do we anticipate

457
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:53,900
what the numbers are going to be so I

458
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:56,840
think and this was prior to this week

459
00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:01,670
that the maximum was going to be 1.75

460
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:03,919
million and that was because in terms of

461
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:08,330
what the uplift was going to be it was

462
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:10,100
going to be high obviously Google and

463
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,199
Facebook are always going to sit outside

464
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:18,850
of normal but that's not where we are

465
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,850
that got totally thrown out the window

466
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:31,879
so they've said VA is 1.5 times the 27th

467
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:37,010
2017 turnover and the turnover for

468
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:40,010
mariette in the UK is 200 million so

469
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:46,010
this 100 million fine obviously is

470
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:49,610
massive in terms of global turnover they

471
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:53,240
were turning over 20 billion so it's not

472
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,679
going four times the turnover that's in

473
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:04,670
the accounts that they've published on

474
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:08,450
their website what I think they're going

475
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:11,480
to do and is if they lawyer off and they

476
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:14,980
do a massive defensive policy on their

477
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,900
documentation they're going to

478
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,090
aggressively defend and appeal the cases

479
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:24,230
and knock it down in terms of severity

480
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:26,330
because there's two benefits one is

481
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,570
obviously it draws out the data which

482
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:32,679
they have to pay fine and the second is

483
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:35,689
that they could actually knock it from a

484
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:39,110
turnover percentage of say one and a

485
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:42,260
half or 1.75 or two to maybe half a

486
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:46,540
percent and because of the Quantum's

487
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,540
it's got to be worthwhile to do that

488
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:54,290
it's got to be

489
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:56,690
what I'm anticipating is that they're

490
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,510
going to possibly reduce their

491
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,820
contractual relationships so if you're

492
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,520
booking by be a comm maybe they'll have

493
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:08,300
an organization that holds the data that

494
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,090
isn't being calm but then obviously you

495
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,919
would then say well that organizations

496
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,020
the organization that holds the data

497
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,360
there the data controller go after them

498
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:23,120
not me ask the organization flying the

499
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:25,219
plane that seemed to be a response that

500
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,620
was happening with health and safety in

501
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,710
terms of breaking up organizations into

502
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:33,020
lots of little sections so it's like

503
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:42,380
well that's where the issue was not with

504
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:44,300
my bigger organization individuals that

505
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,360
I don't know where this is going to go

506
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,639
but at the moment and the fines were

507
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,100
probably around a thousand pound for an

508
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,680
individual I don't know how that

509
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,620
reflects on what's going to happen

510
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,950
because there's a massive imbalance now

511
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,250
before run now between what is an

512
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,170
individual who could cause something

513
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:09,650
going to get compared to what somebody

514
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:14,060
or acting in an organizational capacity

515
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:17,650
going to get or forty so that needs to

516
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,649
be worked out somewhere in somehow

517
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,740
there's something called sentencing

518
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,850
guidance I don't know if anybody's heard

519
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:33,250
of the term but inside the sentencing

520
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,270
council which is a government

521
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,730
organization that works on behalf of the

522
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:41,300
judiciary they are now talking about

523
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:44,570
fines in terms of culpability in harm so

524
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,909
if you are highly culpable and highly

525
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,159
harmful then obviously that's top end of

526
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,530
the scale and if you're low culpability

527
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:55,790
and low harm then that's a low end of

528
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:57,889
the scale and I think that now what

529
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,770
they're looking at is something along

530
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,290
the lines of the turnover percentage so

531
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,150
if you turn around and say well

532
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:07,990
done everything that I possibly could

533
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,900
and the outcome was going to be low

534
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,640
anyway then maybe I want to be at the

535
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,940
bottom of the scale pretty please with a

536
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,910
cherry on top rather than very high

537
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,680
outcome very high hull and I think

538
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,530
that's probably where the arguments are

539
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:29,020
going to end up in terms of what we're

540
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:31,090
going to do about these these issues in

541
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:38,590
terms of the guidance when you when you

542
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:41,439
map the various when you map from and

543
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,439
any case or issue that the sort of

544
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,440
boundary as to what the likely outcomes

545
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,730
could be so if if whatever the offense

546
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,220
is there's like a standard one a low and

547
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:58,780
gray version is probably about noir

548
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:02,590
point four times the standard in my and

549
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:05,020
a high-end one is 1.75 times whatever

550
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,179
that standard is otherwise you're not

551
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:10,570
looking at whatever this offense might

552
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:13,540
be so the question is how you target

553
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,120
what your actual problem is and then how

554
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,909
you argue and discuss but obviously

555
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,310
prepare in advance of obviously having a

556
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,780
breach and investigation to make sure

557
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:38,500
that you're not going to be in this

558
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:41,649
bottom category this is what Margot had

559
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,780
to say in their latest report directors

560
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,150
do not anticipate any significant

561
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:49,240
changes to the company's business in the

562
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:51,520
near future the board is responsible for

563
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,800
the company's system of internal control

564
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,400
and risk management and reviewing its

565
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,399
effectiveness

566
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,440
[Music]

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,080
everything's disclosed in the ultimate

568
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,460
parent company's financial statements

569
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,460
which aren't part of the report

570
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,990
so given that breaches are happening

571
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,280
daily and we know all of these are

572
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,160
happening and they're going to continue

573
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:30,970
to happen then we need to have some song

574
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:33,400
mitigation strategy on it so what are

575
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:37,320
the elements that are probably likely to

576
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,300
reduce risk and these have come from

577
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,510
Verizon's take a breach investigation

578
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:47,230
above so senior management sponsorship

579
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:49,360
your house out by it we do have a list

580
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,090
for that so obviously if you have a list

581
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,949
in your manage things and it's more

582
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,500
likely that when you've checked things

583
00:29:53,950 --> 00:30:00,430
that the backups work if you don't check

584
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,980
them and probably done and if you tested

585
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,540
that you've it fell over last time and

586
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,910
this is what we did and we know who's

587
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,800
done that and how that works then it's

588
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:14,910
more likely to be able to be recovered

589
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,909
faster having a schedule and a planner

590
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:25,690
so in the translation of poem on and the

591
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:29,230
data breach investigation report looked

592
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,270
at well how much is the poem and figure

593
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:35,590
what are the things that make a

594
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:39,550
significant difference to each incident

595
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:41,669
in terms of reducing the cough and what

596
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:46,919
makes a difference in terms of

597
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:49,690
increasing the cost can we take those

598
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,930
reductions and make those happen can we

599
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:57,250
increase things or reduce the things

600
00:30:52,930 --> 00:31:00,220
that make it expensive so could we

601
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,440
remove records the number of records if

602
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:07,090
we chop the number of records available

603
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:08,830
from I don't know 10 years to 6 months

604
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,169
or 3 months or something like that

605
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:13,240
that's obviously a massive amount of

606
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:17,050
reduction in terms of how much the cost

607
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:22,870
would be and we can justify the numbers

608
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:25,360
and know our system so this is a little

609
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:27,429
spreadsheet that I put together and what

610
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,219
you can see is if we've got

611
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:32,350
number of records in a database we can

612
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,980
turn around and say well as a

613
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:38,080
guesstimate which is based on these

614
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,750
estimates and figures we can say well

615
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,210
how many records how much are we looking

616
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,280
at and this is just for the breach in

617
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,770
terms of what are their various costs

618
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:52,540
associated with it and what does the

619
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:57,970
poem say and then how do we adjust it

620
00:31:52,540 --> 00:32:00,460
for us for an actual in cost we can take

621
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:04,570
that same methodology and we can say

622
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,660
well okay it if we look at what the

623
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,090
elements that we have to deal with how

624
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,520
many people do we need how much we're

625
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,250
paying them and happen what what's that

626
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,860
like I'm going to bring out and then we

627
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,620
can have them at different level so 150

628
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:23,080
grid an hour or day I don't know what

629
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:27,250
the range is big five hundred to two

630
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,429
thousand and then extra expenses what

631
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,840
mall together and then get a figure but

632
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,700
at least you've got you've turned around

633
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,490
and said that I've put some sort of

634
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:39,190
figures which I can say justifiably

635
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:42,850
would make sense into my calculator and

636
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,920
this is what we're looking at so it's no

637
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,520
longer a case of to stick your finger in

638
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:54,970
the air job it's a better finger in the

639
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:57,490
air job and it's better estimation and

640
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:00,580
then you can summarize it so that people

641
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:03,190
know what things are there so what can

642
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:07,060
we do now we can agree what systems are

643
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:09,550
valued at we can show our workings we

644
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:14,710
can give time and attention to what's

645
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:18,810
involved we can get the idea of finance

646
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:23,320
bought into what makes a difference and

647
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:25,899
they can show the money in terms of well

648
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,960
unless I know what the impact is going

649
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:31,570
to be why would I spend the money you've

650
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:39,100
got the impact you've got the money you

651
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:41,189
can value it what could a risk planner

652
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,759
look like so

653
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:47,249
this is a spreadsheet based on transport

654
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,320
management but doesn't really matter the

655
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:53,070
important thing is well have we got

656
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:57,299
information about how we get in whom the

657
00:33:53,070 --> 00:34:00,739
owners are how much of a problem is it

658
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:03,929
when it hits the fan we could have a

659
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:06,479
costume applicator the application or

660
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:07,889
maybe some sort of maintenance fees so

661
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:10,500
that we say well what what are we

662
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:12,799
prioritizing here how are we going to

663
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,239
call for ghostbusters when we need them

664
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:17,009
how do we get them are they on a

665
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,558
retainer how we got the phone numbers

666
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,760
and is everything there

667
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:24,899
once everything is there obviously it

668
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,240
makes it a lot easier and then when if

669
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:29,308
we laughs to check the system so if we

670
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,578
if we can demonstrate that we check the

671
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:35,460
system three weeks ago and and we've got

672
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:37,349
a schedule to do it is that going to

673
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,629
help in evidencing that we've got a

674
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:42,179
management managed organized system

675
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:45,359
we're using appropriate technical and

676
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,700
organizational measures and as you've

677
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,639
got a way of showing it that everyone

678
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,529
uses then you can distribute the

679
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,389
responsibilities for the various systems

680
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:57,420
and the various things that are going on

681
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:58,700
and then you can also show a

682
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:05,880
countability

683
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:07,710
ownership and then show the major and

684
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,130
then obviously you can use pretty colors

685
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,170
too because that allows you to either

686
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,359
distribute well these think these events

687
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,250
are happening here but these events are

688
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,098
happening in different occasions or

689
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,390
there's a pen test at this point there's

690
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:26,750
a system update on this date there's a

691
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:32,578
weekly patter patching chedule for

692
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:34,859
Microsoft on a regular basis so what I

693
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,260
wanted to do and is probably not enough

694
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:40,770
people at the moment well I was going to

695
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,500
say well who's going to be the board who

696
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:46,109
would want to be on the board and then

697
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,000
say let's have take some questions that

698
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,359
we've got about security and then how do

699
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,620
how do we put them around the

700
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,100
organization and say to them well

701
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:59,009
maybe this is an this is a an issue that

702
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:03,049
needs to be addressed not just by IT but

703
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,050
by other areas of the business as well

704
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:13,500
so what what roles do you think or what

705
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:19,760
issues need to be looked at and

706
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:23,700
addressed what could be sorted out and

707
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:28,140
then if you look from the perspective of

708
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:31,140
either the critical security control or

709
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:34,580
our assessment and look at your

710
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:37,009
organization that then you can use wasp

711
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:43,259
nest

712
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:47,010
cyber essentials the essential ape from

713
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:50,940
the Australian organize like national

714
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:53,700
signals people and then say is it not on

715
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,160
the radar or we've got everything and

716
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,750
we're happy days with it they need to

717
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,359
say well where should we focus our

718
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:04,190
attention and we've got a threat map if

719
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,190
internally for what's involved

720
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:22,100
I have you all seen the NCSC board

721
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,689
toolkit you heard about to anybody

722
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:29,420
there's a lot of people shaking their

723
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:35,420
heads yes No so and they ask a question

724
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:40,490
of what does good look like so they look

725
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:41,900
at what is the things that the technical

726
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:46,250
team and the board could have a

727
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:49,070
conversation about as a board do we

728
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,960
assure ourselves that our organization's

729
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:56,090
cyber security measures are effective

730
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,530
have we got it integrated with side

731
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:03,310
beside the risk in business risk and

732
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:06,320
what's our plan to develop our current

733
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:09,400
profile have they got the right

734
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,520
expertise for making the right decisions

735
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,580
so if if these sort of things and this

736
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,000
contents available how does it get

737
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:23,720
inside the organization further from an

738
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,270
IT team perspective in an IT problem to

739
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,879
everybody within the senior management

740
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:31,369
structure and then get them coming back

741
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,030
saying I want you to satisfy these

742
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:37,609
criteria please because as they as they

743
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:40,160
do that you can turn around and say well

744
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:44,440
ok we've got the criteria we know what's

745
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,440
going on we can do something about this

746
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:52,430
the next ones I've got are do we have a

747
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:55,190
clear understanding of technical systems

748
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,190
processes assets and how they contribute

749
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,050
into achieving our objectives so if it's

750
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:03,350
old and we're not using it can we turn

751
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:07,310
it off is there a way that we can agree

752
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:10,580
that that's what we're going to do do we

753
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:12,820
identify key and track of systems data

754
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:16,549
and services that we're responsible for

755
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:19,760
so these questions that are going to the

756
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:22,280
board hopefully they'll come back to the

757
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,640
IT team and say how am I going to answer

758
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,619
this so let let's take let's take the

759
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,890
opportunity of feeding three

760
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:33,049
the questions in and then being able to

761
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,609
get the conversation going on here's a

762
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:36,859
response and what we're going to do

763
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:42,078
about it is obviously going to be the

764
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:44,089
next question have we got a process

765
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,660
beside the risk and business risk

766
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:49,460
integration do we have effective and

767
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:53,538
appropriate approach to managing cyber

768
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:58,819
risk how they're escalated what's the

769
00:39:53,539 --> 00:40:01,160
threshold for board involvement is

770
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:04,069
important we clearly set out what types

771
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:07,640
of risks we would be willing to take and

772
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:11,029
those which are unacceptable because

773
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,279
obviously that what we view as being

774
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:16,489
acceptable to us might not be the same

775
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:20,930
view as what's acceptable elsewhere so

776
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:23,180
it may be acceptable that there's a

777
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,069
product that we use that's old but you

778
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,140
know what people can update it or buy a

779
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:28,880
new one or maybe you need to turn around

780
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,038
so you know what it's not going to be

781
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,239
used anymore we'll go to get rid of it

782
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:37,160
or this box that we have used for X

783
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:40,099
amount of time we now have to migrate

784
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,920
the people that are still using it to

785
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:50,920
the new system maybe we need to turn it

786
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:53,569
off extra things I wanted to mention

787
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,940
cyber girls first I don't know if anyone

788
00:40:53,569 --> 00:41:01,460
has heard of it but it's a program that

789
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:05,749
I was told - about aisaka and it's aimed

790
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:12,319
11 to 16 year olds and the idea being

791
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:15,609
that before they get into GCSEs and

792
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:19,660
things like that they keep doing math

793
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:23,479
the person I met she's about 80 and

794
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:28,879
she's running it from her room but she's

795
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:30,890
got JPMorgan Microsoft Oracle that sort

796
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,019
of thing all of them engaged

797
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,549
happy days the people that have been

798
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:37,189
doing the course have gone to either

799
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:39,499
Cambridge to study computer science or

800
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,570
they've been to Downing Street as a

801
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:45,049
result

802
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:46,640
and I think companies are starting to

803
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:49,700
look away from London obviously

804
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,029
Manchester is booming as a IT type area

805
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:55,939
I live in the Northeast I think it'd be

806
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:58,910
nice to see that some of that sort of

807
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,770
thing is happening again I think again

808
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,649
develop the talent I don't know who

809
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:05,570
works in a developer environment but

810
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,850
they it seems that people are poaching

811
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,620
developers so that's going to be a risk

812
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,279
that needs to be highlighted that those

813
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:16,759
people are going to be attracted away

814
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:19,490
and lastly its b-sides in Liverpool and

815
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,490
Peter Blakely was talking about his

816
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,839
campaign to try and find someone which

817
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,120
was interesting because what you're

818
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,110
trying to do is find someone through

819
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,529
social media

820
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:33,440
so I said to imperiously that whenever I

821
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:36,110
did it or pet mention it and but on his

822
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,960
Twitter feed you can see what he's doing

823
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:41,480
but he thinks that he can find someone

824
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,220
through networking on social media

825
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,740
because at some point someone will

826
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:50,029
recognize the person or take a picture

827
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,799
of the person or whatever so those were

828
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:59,060
the things I wanted to talk to put talk

829
00:42:51,800 --> 00:43:01,850
about in summary elements which reduce

830
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:05,680
risk it's obviously important to agree

831
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:07,940
what's high value and using a list and

832
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,790
sharing that list and having that

833
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,740
sunshine on it allows you to turn around

834
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:16,279
say well what are we doing about this

835
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:19,339
thing over here and schedule in the

836
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,620
planet obviously allows you to say well

837
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,960
let's look at these things on our time

838
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,600
frame rather than on a Friday afternoon

839
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,090
when no one's here and we don't want to

840
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,190
do it because we don't even know who

841
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:34,400
that person is that used to run that

842
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:38,470
system that's now left so you're

843
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:42,220
learning at your timing on on your

844
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:46,609
schedule rather than on someone else's

845
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:50,109
and I truly believe that sunshine is the

846
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,110
best disinfectant

847
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,210
[Applause]

848
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:55,769
that's why consortium so British Airways

849
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:57,749
is fine they the same the Notice of

850
00:44:55,769 --> 00:45:01,410
Intent the first stage in the filing

851
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:03,328
process they take lots of things into

852
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,489
account when setting and proposed fine

853
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:07,189
including type data the number of people

854
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:10,430
affected and seriousness of the incident

855
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:12,808
so if those are what they've said to me

856
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:17,669
then that's what they're saying to you

857
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:21,660
as well this is what Murray had said in

858
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:25,650
their latest report that's from Mary

859
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:27,049
King that the issues that they've got at

860
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,509
the moment they're talking about

861
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:32,400
numerous class-action lawsuits foreign

862
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:35,789
government authorities I think that

863
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,489
means the ICO material remedial and

864
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:43,049
other expenses which may not be covered

865
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:46,319
insurance including fines and then next

866
00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:49,469
pages undertakings so they're going to

867
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,499
get undertakings they're going to have

868
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:55,799
to materially increase our data security

869
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:58,919
costs or otherwise require us to alter

870
00:45:55,799 --> 00:46:01,140
how we operate our business payment card

871
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,900
networks may seek to attribute losses

872
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,670
and other expenses significant

873
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,429
management time and company resources

874
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:13,739
have been and may continue to be devoted

875
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:15,779
to the data security incident insurance

876
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:20,189
may not be sufficient or available to

877
00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:22,049
cover all of our expenses and the

878
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:24,299
relevant insurance cover may not be

879
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:30,299
available in the future on commercially

880
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:32,130
reasonable terms or at all to date they

881
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:34,259
say that aren't in terms of booking

882
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:37,589
they've not seen a meaningful impact on

883
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:40,349
demand so the demands going to be fine

884
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:42,779
but obviously the cost isn't they don't

885
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:47,309
believe this incident will impact our

886
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:51,420
long-term financial health expect to

887
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:53,479
incur significant expenses legal

888
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:57,060
proceedings regulatory investigations

889
00:46:53,479 --> 00:47:00,419
expenses and capital investments come

890
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:04,350
clients activities and increased legal

891
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:07,380
and regulatory requirements so if you

892
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:11,759
take these slides which will be

893
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:13,860
available in post then maybe by getting

894
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,040
those in that information into the

895
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:19,410
relevant people and then across the

896
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,630
organization then should there be an

897
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,569
impact is there a way of getting that

898
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,370
impact across the organization because

899
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,410
that's the impact that what the people

900
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,720
are saying and they haven't been told

901
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,220
what the fine was but that's what

902
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,819
they've forecast and that's what they're

903
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:38,040
concerned about so allow it to be used

904
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,860
as a way of presenting that let's not

905
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,310
have that happen to us thank you very

906
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,429
much

907
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,429
[Applause]
