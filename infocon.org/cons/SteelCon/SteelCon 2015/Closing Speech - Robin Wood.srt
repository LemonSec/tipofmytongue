1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,160
so we've survived another year

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:24,210
never happen again yeah brilliant star
asking for feedback all the colors do it

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,439
is really important we want to know what
you like what you didn't like what I

4
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,800
wanna see you next year and yes all the
negative stuff will probably hurt our

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,319
feelings for a little while but it will
make it better next year so please tell

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,010
us what you like

7
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:46,330
tells what you didn't like we have plans
for next year so it will be happening we

8
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:52,930
need to know what you want us to do no
thank you to all our sponsors again

9
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,760
without that today could not happened
yet hopefully visited the birds with

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:07,679
their websites for if you need subsidies
from them later on however I felt by

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,160
Shelia however if you don't know rooms a
security costs as part of a meeting

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,940
pollens honors a master's degrees so if
you want to get into security that's one

13
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:30,429
option for support the next year

14
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:34,140
teams when we started asking companies
