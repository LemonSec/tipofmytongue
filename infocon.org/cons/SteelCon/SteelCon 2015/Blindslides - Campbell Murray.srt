1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:36,829
and that's a very brief opening talk and
often this

2
00:00:36,829 --> 00:01:00,720
the subject now I'm done with what I
wanted to talk about that

3
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:20,710
20 slides also I still cannot do the
things slightly differently I do hope

4
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:30,020
wherever the organizational hidden going
forward as it turns out on the only

5
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:37,030
person to get along with this my friends
are now I did not write I've never seen

6
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:58,040
them write about

7
00:01:58,040 --> 00:04:08,630
change

8
00:04:08,630 --> 00:05:38,340
getting pictures

9
00:05:38,340 --> 00:06:20,590
I think this may be a subtle dig at my
age

10
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:45,409
allegedly an interesting point where I
read recently needs that are looking to

11
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:58,960
tariffs microbes in life and see if I
can I change the nature of habitable

12
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,349
which raises interesting questions

13
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:15,969
ethical debates and get those articles
like found on asteroids and I love a

14
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,680
real fan of conspiracy theories just
because they make me

15
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:40,990
people's views on the Illuminati did
this and technology 3d printing one-way

16
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:51,320
trips to double world millions of miles
away when we sign up from a trip to mars

17
00:07:51,320 --> 00:08:57,290
people's names

18
00:08:57,290 --> 00:10:26,390
thank you very much

19
00:10:26,390 --> 00:11:28,550
just mentioned in the post in secret
Illuminati 911 was a lie it is currently

20
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:55,589
there are no actual time

21
00:11:55,590 --> 00:13:15,560
every three years

22
00:13:15,560 --> 00:16:01,378
there is one of the things I do

23
00:16:01,379 --> 00:17:04,529
children and say thank you very much for
sharing with me there's anybody does

24
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:09,378
have any questions at all about anything
I've said as long as in operating the

25
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:18,549
flight got a couple of minutes but why
did you do that Campbell do you agree

26
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:29,580
that this to be honest I think yeah I
would

27
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:39,020
I would fight again however I think I
would choose my crowdsourcing flight

28
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:51,290
created a little bit more careful next
time don't use your friends to this day

29
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:59,190
will be revenge but first of all
qualities that I secondly thank you very

30
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,370
much
