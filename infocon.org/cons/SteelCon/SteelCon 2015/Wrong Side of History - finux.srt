1
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,360
so high I'm Phoenix

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:25,119
I'm going to talk about gonna talk about
the similarities between the manhattan

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,260
project in the global surveillance news
that came out reason why she recently

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,480
about two years ago I'm going to talk
about the Manhattan Project hands up if

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,599
you know the manhattan project is okay
I'll not do the German join the

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,780
surprisingly a lot I live in Germany now
if you're wondering where all this job

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,360
stuff comes from and we talked about
manhattan project I'm gonna talk about

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,290
the global surveillance project you know
prism of above all of the stuff that

9
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:06,119
stopped the Guardian from going bankrupt
people have got to eat right way not

10
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,440
let's not get back so the first striking
similarity between both the Manhattan

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,800
Project and the global surveillance
project is surprise surprise that both

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,330
top secret projects as I said this
earlier on in the highlight the

13
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:31,470
manhattan project employed a hundred and
ten thousand people a thousand knew what

14
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,908
they were doing so they can give you a
rough idea about what you can really get

15
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:45,840
away with without people noticing so the
first striking similarity between the

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,060
Manhattan Project and the global
surveillance stuff is that both both

17
00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:00,150
instant both bands have suffered from
whistleblowers few people realize this

18
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,810
this guy called clubs fuchs you guys
know who he is if you're a break you

19
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,200
should be ashamed of yourself right now
this is the reason that we have a

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,859
nuclear project in the UK comes fruits
was a German Jew who suddenly found

21
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,849
their homes a little bit hostile towards
the beginning of World War Two became a

22
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,660
came to Britain seek asylum we gave it

23
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:39,980
and the he became part of our equipment
the manhattan project he's also a

24
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,579
trained to the Great Britain as well

25
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,310
was convicted for treason and sentenced
to 14 years he's also the reason that

26
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,960
the Soviet Union had a nuclear weapon to
but we'll talk about this later on when

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,720
you think about the damage that can be
done this nameless all that no one

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,220
really knows it far much more than this
one that we all know all roads lead to

29
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,480
Russia as well right which is a little
bit strange so people that wondering why

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,959
the the manhattan project was about the
manhattan project was about building a

31
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:26,840
nuclear weapon so just before world war
two starts they managed to split the

32
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,570
atom in Berlin and everyone with a grade
school and high school grade education

33
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,150
in physics understands very very quickly

34
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,320
holy shit we can make a bomb and we just
wore it might be really handy but to be

35
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,090
fair what was really hard for people to
get their head around was trying to

36
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,380
explain the nuclear weapon to people
don't have experience to of conventional

37
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,930
weapons is about explaining bigger bands
right i mean it's a problem that we have

38
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,940
insecurities I mean it's we've got we're
gonna have a bank but we've got bangs

39
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,750
now it's going to be really big how big
ten thousand times because you had just

40
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,070
doesn't comprehend it so how did the
Manhattan Project star the manhattan

41
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:20,730
project started like all great projects
star by fear uncertainty and doubt right

42
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:30,450
so who knows who this guy is Einstein
Einstein have a choice of come to

43
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,940
Britain had a choice going to America
where do you think you when you went to

44
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,270
America

45
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:47,400
so you might see you write the letter
goes to Cbus president and explains to

46
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,539
the you s president the germans Hitler
hasn't newt right he's going to nuke you

47
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,700
need to start building a nuclear weapon
they have weapons of mass destruction

48
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:06,340
and if we don't start now we're done is
over we need to start doing now he was

49
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,669
famous then is the is now right so if
you're talking the one of the world's

50
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,540
most famous scientist killing an
American president in building new what

51
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:24,930
do you think happened the manhattan
project started ok today is still one of

52
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,910
the most expensive projects that the
us-led military

53
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,100
this do you guys know what this is

54
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:44,260
know this is a nuclear reactor this is
actually the first nuclear reactor this

55
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,440
is where it all goes batshit insane
right they built this in Chicago under a

56
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,480
sports field not know any nuclear
reactors while the first nuclear reactor

57
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,970
they had no idea he said control rods
pulled them out to to start the nuclear

58
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,220
reaction ok I can guarantee you if you
build a nuclear reactor in your basement

59
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,510
you're probably gonna go to write it's
not a challenge for you to accept by

60
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,599
always friendly advice not something I
would get into the actually had health

61
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,820
and safety offices there with buckets of
distilled water you know your schedule

62
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,710
is distilled war had no idea what was
going on in about this and what they

63
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:42,310
were able to prove is that they could
they can start a reaction process and

64
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,650
then the project begins

65
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,370
so what we find with varies it's really
easy to think about you really hard to

66
00:06:50,370 --> 00:07:00,740
put it into practice so they could split
data and produce a nuclear reaction they

67
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,590
just won't you sure about the best way
to go about it and what they knew was

68
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,419
the materials that they had were not
sufficient for the job basically they

69
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:18,960
needed uranium 238 which they'd only
ever produced in in lab quantities which

70
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,830
is you know couple of grains of SAT what
they needed was some pounds and pounds

71
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,760
of this material and no idea how to do
it so this was the first problem and

72
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,990
they had to solve a problem for him
because these different theories of how

73
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,880
you could enrich uranium so it was
wartime just to save the war it was to

74
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,039
save civilization to stop it from being
so bad blah blah blah blah blah so they

75
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,349
had their backs and went for every way
that they knew to enrich uranium they'll

76
00:07:54,349 --> 00:08:01,520
have a go and they they built a number
of plants two billion dollars in and you

77
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,940
ask wartime billion dollars in nineteen
forty four or forty well early forties

78
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,289
they they spent two billion equivalent
26 billion dollars today so pretty cheap

79
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:20,710
if we think about the the the what we
spend now in more interesting story for

80
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:28,260
you they the Los Alamos plant consumed
per cent of wartime America's

81
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,990
electricity put that in context with you
they use more electricity than Chicago

82
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,700
and Boston put together right no one
noticed so anyway they built the

83
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,990
building number of plants here are the
heroes some of them five of them

84
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,320
Los Alamos is probably the most famous
this is a gaseous diffusion plant this

85
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,180
is very interesting you see these these
legs here this you shape of the building

86
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:03,739
these are half a mile long ok op til
1980 1983 I think the USA government

87
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,029
disclosed what this building was up
until then they did which is quite

88
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,270
interesting because this was the largest
military building a bill and still no

89
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:20,740
one noticed rate they had no when we
built it they had no idea what they were

90
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,640
going to build they just knew it was
going to be big right that's that's all

91
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,520
they knew so when they laid the
foundations for this thing they didn't

92
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,290
know they didn't know what they were
going to put on the roof right there

93
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,420
hadn't thought that far as they still
managed to get out is also slightly

94
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:46,860
radioactive to go this is a general
groves is an interesting character he's

95
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,610
the guy who built the pentagon he's also
the guy the military arm that supported

96
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,450
all of these physicist talk a little bit
about him in a little while he's a

97
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,170
famous story I feel that his assistant
and happy as we have a little bit in

98
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,020
common at the moment right so you have
this military guy goatees military

99
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,370
leaders and say I can't work with these
physicists and they're all prima donnas

100
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,709
I just cannot get a straight answer out
of him every time I speak to them they

101
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,660
just speak to me in a different language
sounds a little bit familiar right I

102
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:28,649
hear this all the time so

103
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:37,110
physicists about building some of their
plants

104
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:44,249
the physicist said because they didn't
know this was a research project right

105
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:48,990
they they gave their estimates to a
factor of time

106
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,809
doesn't sound that sounds like
conservative with the union of this

107
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:57,069
military guy who builds military
buildings like the pentagon he isn't

108
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:00,839
really used to this gray area you need
to tell me in black and white what you

109
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,809
want and I will build it that's kind of
how this works he was explaining to

110
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:14,139
eisenhower it's like me arranging a
wedding party for 4,000 people but maybe

111
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,699
thirty or turn up or maybe three
thousand alternate you know you know you

112
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:24,160
can't expect me to build these things
and basically what they said was shut up

113
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,939
build these things so the scientists one
in this in this story right now

114
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:35,498
interesting thing about los alamos is
that it's an interesting plants so I

115
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:41,120
could oppenheimer pretty sure you've
heard of he he was asked to head up a

116
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,999
project a little bit of a controversial
choice to say the least

117
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:51,959
you spoke to grows and grows wanted to
do was split all the scientists put them

118
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,388
in different parts of the country
because of security right departmental

119
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:02,350
eyes of resources so that if someone
compromises a site they don't have the

120
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,800
whole picture just very typical in a
military way of doing things not so

121
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,829
typical for theoretical physicists who
were building the world's first nuclear

122
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:17,219
weapon they might need to be around each
other so they came up with a solution

123
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,999
where they were going to build it campus
specifically for building a nuclear

124
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,709
weapon they were going to bring in all
the brightest and we're going to put

125
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,649
them in the comp the problem with us

126
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:33,970
you don't take lessons from Chicago
right so in Chicago you build a nuclear

127
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,579
reactor and felt the same they sat down
and thought about it when you know let's

128
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,620
let's put it in the middle of

129
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,090
nowhere right just just in case
something goes wrong let's let's not put

130
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,880
it in a dense popular area so they won't
the middle of the desert 200 miles away

131
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:58,090
from adding another interesting security
talk right aspect

132
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:03,180
be careful about what knowledge you know
where you disclose it an example to this

133
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:09,329
is so they build Los Alamos to start
shipping all of these physicists waiter

134
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,140
and there is this little train station

135
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,850
nobody is ever used to go to Chicago
cash the training to this place you get

136
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,760
picked up in an army jeep taken off the
Los Alamos so the train clerk has

137
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,460
started noticing that station in the
whole twenty-odd years that I've been

138
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,620
working here no one is ever taking the
train to all of a sudden we're starting

139
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,880
selling tickets and there's nothing
there to compound the problem may not

140
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,770
even get in return to his to just
getting single tickets what is going on

141
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,910
needless to say he was relocated from
his position and we shall never talk of

142
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,880
this gentleman again right but yeah
upset you know it's not just a dream

143
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,270
right

144
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:06,900
so mister said manhattan project
employed about a hundred and ten

145
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:14,500
thousand people is pretty big brown is a
huge deployment numerous of these people

146
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,240
have no idea what they were doing
they're doing just general day-to-day

147
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:28,670
operations so some of the plants had a
whole city culture attached to them I

148
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:36,329
think so I think the one in Tennessee
had two football teams had baseball

149
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,210
teams you know mars shops the big hole
amount of people working there doing

150
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,400
things there's an interesting story
about this manhattan project comes

151
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,610
flames everyone is a bit like when you
speak to him an American right

152
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,000
speech in american they always know
someone who was on the Mayflower it's a

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,540
bit like this with the Manhattan Project
to the time whenever they everyone has a

154
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,189
story about working from manhattan
project we was a woman who did have a

155
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:13,870
story she had a very strange job working
in the launch and waving this magic

156
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,649
stick over the laundry and when the
stick start making noises she was to go

157
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,450
in that in general will stick turned out
to be a Geiger counter and when she was

158
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:30,240
contamination so basically click click
click all we've had a leak I'm gonna get

159
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,480
the general but this was her job for you
she had no idea that she was frontline

160
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,120
decontamination give you a rough idea
about how need to know actually was

161
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,300
always find stories amazing right I
don't know we have a date here at

162
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,880
Eclipse right I'm getting knocked around
tell us that will still talk story so

163
00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:05,480
1945 happens and who knows what happens
in 1945 the German surrender for a long

164
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,470
time they've been building weapons to
specifically talk to German threat ok

165
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:19,350
that the Germans are going to new cures
and all of a sudden Germany it's not all

166
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,579
of a sudden is not an unknown this is
this was on the cards for our journey

167
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,209
surrenders what do you think happens to
the Manhattan Project it just carries

168
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:33,518
ongoing like Jeremy still in war
remember jimmy had weapons of mass

169
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,130
destruction right and they were going to
nuke America and oh my god if we don't

170
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,689
do something now we're never going to be
able to do anything this is the German

171
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:52,110
reactor the non functional German
reactor turns out they were slightly

172
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,680
preoccupied with occupation and didn't
find too much time to do

173
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,459
R&D for news so they had very very very
little in the way of

174
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,410
any program whatsoever at all although I
will tell you whether their their

175
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,160
research stands up quite interesting so
this is this is the inspection of their

176
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:19,690
reaction as I say absolutely no nukes
strange isn't it like I remember an

177
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:26,350
incident in a couple of years ago where
we invaded a country because they had

178
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,439
weapons of mass destruction and I'm like
home would you mean that there is no

179
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,510
nothing here you know what's interesting
about that story is one of the huge

180
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,490
positive evidence that was given to me
by a guy called hans blix does anyone

181
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:49,980
know about his big sis the nuclear
weapons inspector who told them they can

182
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,480
make you when you make make a bomb

183
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,500
they've got the infrastructure they
could have the new right

184
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:03,300
the same story that was used very very
interesting so I was Brett's germans we

185
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,330
work this all out right you know
surrender happens however the us- is

186
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:14,580
still at war with Japan so ww2 is still
kicking off its just not in our backyard

187
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,360
anymore right so this is the interesting
story

188
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:29,610
U-boat 234 ok amazing story hugely
interesting but let's I only find this

189
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,990
story interesting because the context of
the implications to contact the store

190
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:43,560
pretty harrowing so who knows why we
were able to hammer the German Navy so

191
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:52,330
hot again and I we broke enigma so we
pretty much broke the back of the

192
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,360
germans naval systems and you to 34 was
the biggest you vote that they had a

193
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,290
problem is they don't have too many
sailors left good way of sinking them

194
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:09,300
pretty much stopped them from being
useful right so rikki Compton they give

195
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,740
to this is U-boat 234 so

196
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,700
towards the end of the world as we
discussed the indictment was a huge

197
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,490
player so the only way that Germany and
Japan were able to communicate securely

198
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,510
used to send to secure such a relative
term right but the only way that they

199
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,940
can communicate was to send U-boats to
each other right so that's how they work

200
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,309
that's how they were communicating they
were putting like offices on boats and

201
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:43,200
sending them and then we were trying to
bomb them on the way so you 2342

202
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,270
Japanese ambassador's make it to germany
and Germany's Germany's history is

203
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,230
written in the books already raised its
coming here knows it's here and Japan

204
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:01,080
Lika argument that if the worst succeed
it needs to be the flag-bearer right

205
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,050
whatever Germany can assist Japan it
needs to do it now and Japan will

206
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,428
continue on fighting it's a very
desperate from Japan Japan where we're

207
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:18,260
in no winning streak at this point
either bizarrely agrees with them and

208
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,280
what he does is he takes you to 34 which
is a battle + you vote under the sea

209
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,520
boat they like to call them they strip
it and they turn into a cargo vessel and

210
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,230
then what they do is they put basically
hitler's treasure trove of evil ship in

211
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:42,460
the submarine is caused by planes new
weapons and all of the germans nuclear

212
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,440
project which with some you to 35 which
still needed to be enriched but it was a

213
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,380
good starting point it was the plans
their ideas I mean you know it's not

214
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,960
going to give you a bomb but it's a
bloody good stuff because up to this

215
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,600
point

216
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:04,830
Japan didn't have anything so off they
send what is interesting videos of the

217
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:10,360
germans sailors that were on the decks
saying how weird this whole thing was to

218
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,309
Japanese guys came up in speaker word
German and they started walking around

219
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:20,570
in writing you to 35 on the boxes the
gems sailors had no idea what the cargo

220
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,990
where they just thought these were
stupid Japanese guys right you 235 w 22

221
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,760
free fall

222
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,540
right seriously this is what they
thought no other japanese were writing

223
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,800
you to 35 something else so anyway they
set off on off they go and we break the

224
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,810
break the code being sent out and we
don't know what's on the boat but we

225
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,990
should know that it's important enough
noise going on was so very very

226
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:56,470
interested in it so we basically start
bombing its its path this boat should to

227
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:05,120
about 300 feet the bombing was so severe
that they took the boat to 600 ok far

228
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,399
far beyond what it was supposed to do i
mean a depth charge anywhere near could

229
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,560
have easily sank them and their reports
that this is not the only shipments of

230
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,040
Iranian that was supposed to be sent to
Japan you know there is believed that

231
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,260
some uranium is still in broken U-boats
at the bottom of certain sees but so

232
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:32,379
right away you know the germans survived
an onslaught like you wouldn't believe

233
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:40,280
they finally outrun the allies they
surface so they got reception two gether

234
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:48,030
signals to get their commands and they
hear that hilary is now that the Third

235
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,970
Reich has surrendered unconditionally
you are crazy black flag upon your mast

236
00:22:52,970 --> 00:23:00,610
and you are to sail to your nearest
Allied fleet and surrender and of course

237
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,610
the commander of the u-boat doesn't
really have a choice right he ignores

238
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:11,479
those commands he's a pirate and he will
be the first such which is really

239
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,260
interesting problem because they happen
to have two Japanese guys on their boat

240
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:24,110
who haven't surrounded who are still at
war with America and the only in vessels

241
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:29,590
in the area or a Canadian bustle an
American vessel the Germans have decided

242
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,560
that they want to for some reason
surrender to the Americans not the

243
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,800
Canadiens no idea why they give bad
signal intelligence to the canadians and

244
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,820
head out to meet the Americans the
problem is you have these two guys on

245
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,800
board that went on to ship full of
allies when they started and became

246
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,790
prisoners straight afterwards right
where tens of these two buses also

247
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:58,000
happen to know a little bit about
submarines so the U-boat commander was a

248
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,470
little bit concerned about this and he
locked in their rooms relieve them of

249
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,180
their weapons blah blah blah blah blah
they didn't hear from them for a couple

250
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,580
of hours went in to check special price
they've committed suicide notes probable

251
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:18,580
that L and the wife of one of the
ambassador's that she believes the

252
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,020
husband could have sunk the ship but
decided to save everyone's life

253
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,110
basically night he would just take it on
because he was not going to be taken by

254
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:33,300
the Americans so anyway the boat comes
along they surrender themselves to Aus

255
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,280
smaller ship that put on the guns they
bring into the USS talk only when it

256
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,410
pulls into you realize that it's the
equivalent of like a two-hour shouting

257
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,780
down a rock viola it's a tiny little
boat big bow and it's like any day of

258
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,610
the week and twice on Sunday the Germans
were always gonna win this argument

259
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,270
apart from this day

260
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:04,690
ISO 200 over and this is when they start
to look through the tenori-on workout

261
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,470
that actually is about this both
slightly interesting uranium is quite a

262
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,490
rare property was enough to build a bomb
that had enough uranium in that was

263
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:19,540
pretty cool so the manhattan project
turned up and took the uranium and then

264
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,490
threw it into their reactor turned into
uranium 238 and that made parts of the

265
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:31,240
bomb dropped on Hiroshima so history

266
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,429
he should have a cruel sense of irony
yes it got in Richton delivered by the

267
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:44,760
American history has a very crude sense
of irony right it's not enough to make a

268
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,260
bomb but it's it's a sizable amount you
have no idea with what care they true to

269
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,110
the treated this uranium they got the
uranium and certain the power with the

270
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,899
rest of uranium it wasn't like and the
little bit of the ball here is the

271
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:05,280
German part so yeah they they they took
something like four hundred pounds and

272
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,910
turned into 50 grams that's the kind of
attrition rate you looking at this is

273
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,090
little boy this is one of the weapons is
a bit strange the call a little boy

274
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:23,209
right doesn't look so fucking loan
that's why they call it this is fat man

275
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:30,410
not the five and Tayside metropolitan
area network for anyone from Janet this

276
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:36,460
is this bad boy right you don't wanna
mess around with this is this is

277
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,580
basically the gadget this is the test
piece is quite funny in this story as

278
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,889
well

279
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,400
five years they took them together and
finally they've made enough plutonium

280
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,700
and uranium they can they've got enough
to spare right to blow up a test piece

281
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:01,140
so they're pretty sure that the pretty
sure that little boys going to work as a

282
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:07,410
piston system is inefficient but it will
work but they're not too sure how this

283
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:14,570
which is an implosion method work so
there goes the day as well

284
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,439
problems along the way right so they
bring out this great big bomb four days

285
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,070
the constructing the training ground
that Alma Gordo which is called Death

286
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,010
Valley by the way apparently if you in
the New Mexico desert if you call on

287
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,200
this path without any water

288
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,090
died they thought it was a great place
to stop project Trinity which is Alma

289
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,980
good over the bill they got it so they
start building it take the plutonium

290
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,930
call

291
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:50,220
they they go to put it in the gadget and
it doesn't fit right after six years of

292
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:59,640
plutonium call does not fit in the bomb
scares me pretty cool all the way

293
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,010
through it but he's at this point where
he's like well for years we've been

294
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:13,129
building this for this long and you're
telling me it doesn't science right what

295
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:18,930
they forgot was the case been out in the
Sun for four days and that the heat in

296
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:24,200
the Sun and expect expanded the metal
components of the device will they

297
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,430
needed to do was leave the plutonium
core out for a couple of hours to get up

298
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,430
to similar temperature dropped by but
just just for a couple of minutes

299
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,800
boy did they think they felt so you can
imagine how nervous she would be like

300
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:46,800
two billion dollars later told him it
doesn't fit I didn't allow not only did

301
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,399
not go via web application so the most
infamous picture we probably see

302
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,720
throughout history there's been a cool
moment that changes changes everything

303
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,760
they had no idea I say to you that had
no idea of what would happen they took

304
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,840
backs right so you know the sweepstakes
if someone's pregnant in the office you

305
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,040
bet on the baby's weight that's exactly
what they did here like hey when it goes

306
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,680
off how many kilotons well I'm gonna
take 2 I'm gonna take twenty I'm gonna

307
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,670
take thirteen I'm gonna take 11 seasons
sanctions that building the ship had no

308
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:35,390
idea right they just knew is gone be a
big right ok they were a little bit

309
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:42,850
right so the spectators like
twenty-month 200 miles away right this

310
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:48,449
how far you can see this thing and their
advice was when the detonation goes off

311
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,519
lay on your back with your feet towards
the explosion

312
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,769
right and you'll be ok thanks for that

313
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:03,479
like I really need to do to what that
show so anyway and we talked about a

314
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:08,119
little bit to do any of you know where
Tyler is he's really the harbinger of

315
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:14,799
death so he'd managed to scare the shit
he was one of the the Greek went to

316
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:22,070
America fantastic physicist very very
egocentric though he managed to sell but

317
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,468
he managed to basically scare the whole
entire account that there was a

318
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:30,539
possibility that a nuclear weapon was
going to ignite the atmosphere right

319
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:35,739
which you can imagine if you're a
military person that's probably slightly

320
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:40,109
worrying to hear i mean for any other
person is a little bit concerning as

321
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:47,329
well so general rose walks into the
office space oppenheimer shots

322
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:52,289
oppenheimer and I'm so no we've we've
crunched the numbers and words got it

323
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:59,139
wrong ok it's only a one in three
million right that suggest that dole 24

324
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:05,379
there's a one-in-three million chance
that the we could ignite the atmosphere

325
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:11,958
you can imagine is a general it's not
one that kind of how to punish trying to

326
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:16,779
convince the whole office that will blow
this up the atmosphere we're glad to

327
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:20,879
report that metallic was wrong right you
know they did they still fuckin turned

328
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:30,468
on right well you know we don't turn 3
million of them on this ok right so this

329
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:33,139
is probably one of the most infamous
quote that you'll ever find from

330
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:41,508
oppenheimer oppenheimer is a complex
character passionately believed the

331
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:50,809
atomic weapon adamantly against I
imagine that once you once you build a

332
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,200
war war stop her

333
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,149
you probably don't want to be involved
in building too many more we have a an

334
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,030
equivalent of oppenheimer

335
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:05,960
members name in the UK who once we built
our weapon project icon ops all his

336
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,290
papers he didn't keep his papers his
journals everything he didn't want to be

337
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,879
remembered in life somebody built a
nuclear weapon so it's a bit of a tough

338
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,530
cookie to carry out margin but as a safe
America still at war with Japan who

339
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,910
quite clearly doesn't have a new project
because you just enriched uranium right

340
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:33,910
to you you kind of ahead of the game you
know it's not gonna have so few logistic

341
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,470
problems in dropping a nuclear weapon
right like you can't just turn up you

342
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,530
you can't send it via DHL wrote you know
the Royal Mail was not going to deliver

343
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:55,940
this you will need a signature for that
ok so they had to have to practice

344
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,570
flying planes these guys have no idea
what they were doing until later on this

345
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:06,620
is the most amazing story ever see this
guy here right he said he was gonna do

346
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,189
the first bomb run nuclear weapons and
he thought this plane is going to be the

347
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:22,390
most famous plane in history right so we
named after his mother enola gay so

348
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:29,770
history now records that gave bombed
Hiroshima but you know interestingly

349
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:36,850
enough so they practice this run they
going to do it you know when we speak

350
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:41,399
speak about snowed in we talk about why
didn't he use official channels to

351
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,870
suggest a little segue feel why didn't
why didn't he gon speak to people about

352
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:51,649
what he discovered you know he's an
example of people involved in the

353
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:59,310
Manhattan Project writing saying we've
seen the demonstration of the web you

354
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:07,470
cannot drop this on japan ranks they
have no nuclear project you cannot do

355
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,810
this you need to set up a demonstration
and show them

356
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:17,690
you cannot drop this on people this is
the petition and they set up in Chicago

357
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:23,929
this is the petition and his staff las
alamos the oppenheimer himself stopped

358
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:28,020
from being distributed throughout the
rest of the camp this is the official

359
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,969
channels and their answer was is too
quiet all of these prima donna

360
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,100
physicists as they like to call them
where they were going to have a debate

361
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:42,880
where they were going to have debate
basically with the president's man but

362
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,750
dropping the weapon and don't let
history confuse the selection of the

363
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:55,889
bombing targets they specifically shows
civilian areas to drop their bombs if

364
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:00,680
you look at where both bombs were
dropped there were military targets that

365
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,310
they completely missed and in the choice
to bomb down the center of town another

366
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,700
interesting fact for you

367
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,680
Hiroshima and Nagasaki both were not
bombed by conventional weapons for a

368
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,020
good 11 days prior to them being bombed
because what they needed was a city in

369
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,920
top so that they could gauge the damage
so you were sitting there if you were in

370
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,010
hiroshima thinking while everyone else
had been bombed with a blast

371
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:34,340
yeah maybe not but like I said this is
the official channels that quite clearly

372
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,780
didn't want the people who built it
saying we can't do it

373
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,360
Hiroshima Nagasaki this is the case by
the way of the black box where anything

374
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,290
anything we should just build stuff
whatever they build those artists out

375
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:55,890
right now that's the ship they send they
send a lot of the manhattan scientists a

376
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:02,520
way to look at hiroshima none of them
are pretty much the same afterwards

377
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,560
right it's quite hard to get their head
around when we sit there and laugh about

378
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,830
nuclear weapons but it doesn't have any
more eyes right there's still a huge

379
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,940
amount of damage done in this Japan
didn't have nuclear project power pretty

380
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,119
close to surrender

381
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:25,829
it's a lot of debate that this weapon
was dropped a lot more to scare the

382
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:31,700
soviets than it was to be the judge
needs and you can still see this later

383
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:37,098
on russian intelligence we haven't
spoken about the russians is not

384
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:45,130
security and cyber without the russians
right to the russians bear so the

385
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,490
Americans gap a game-changer weapon the
Americans drop it on a country that

386
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,508
doesn't have any weapons and another
country without any weapons looks

387
00:36:55,509 --> 00:37:02,279
diego's holy shit they're going to do
that to us right so startling decides we

388
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:06,220
might want to get involved in this
nuclear research project right now that

389
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:11,169
we've tried no no we're going to do it
now we tried know if you don't do it I'm

390
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:20,730
gonna kill you trust me he killed a lot
of people this is this by the way

391
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:28,230
IP theft IP that plus plus plus a
suprise suprise russians are pretty

392
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:34,089
known as a lot and they like to March
and take over ship I don't like to fly

393
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:40,089
in we just walk away with doing it so
the russians had plans but they didn't

394
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:45,058
have any bombers little bit it's pretty
much the same again we can be a

395
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:49,579
challenge so what we gonna do when we
gonna meet Obama so we've got to build a

396
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:58,089
bomb and bomber ya know the americans
build it in Mexico right yeah ok send an

397
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:03,099
engine with a suitcase full of cash to
the factory bribe someone to give you

398
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:09,890
the plans and that's exactly what
happened so this is the to pull off and

399
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:16,190
this is the Flying Fortress which is an
exact carbon copy Coast outsourcing they

400
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:23,089
paid the Mexican and they got the money
like dating give a shit sure this is the

401
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:27,989
best I don't think I've ever heard about
anecdote than this one right now so the

402
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,200
reverse engineer looks at the American
Boeing plan

403
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,399
ends and sides make this but we can make
some improvements here here and here

404
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,140
says no I want an exact copy this
sometimes in life people say stuff

405
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:49,089
without thinking right and get to get to
tell the consequences and this is one of

406
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:54,880
them to starting system engineer no I
want you to build an exact copy to

407
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:04,980
reverse engineer says he wants to paint
the stars on to the guy lives to tell

408
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,660
the tale which is surprising because
there's a lot of people who died for a

409
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:17,560
lot less than 80 they were all like he's
like a legend in my book i mean this is

410
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,759
this is how we get into trouble anyway

411
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:31,520
basically the Tupolev is a carbon copy
of the the the the Americans so the

412
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:39,750
Manhattan Project the russians the home
Russian weapons system basically their

413
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:50,069
first job is literally a photocopy
plants fruits gave the russians the

414
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:55,650
plans from the manhattan project so talk
a little bit about classrooms what he

415
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:03,030
was part of our project when we got
involved in the nuclear game before the

416
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,280
Americans when the americans decided to
get involved they said well why don't we

417
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,810
absorb your your team where turns out
that our guy was an ardent communist

418
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:20,440
regime in giving information to the
russians for quite a while but how about

419
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:26,550
this for a clusterfuck they blew the
russians top nuclear agent and dropped

420
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,380
him right in the middle of the manhattan
project right literally they flew their

421
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:37,250
assets and the russians lost contact
with him like where's that guy going and

422
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,370
he finally makes contact with them in LA
where you are

423
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:49,190
so they didn't bomb everything you say
so everyone's part about blah blah blah

424
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,760
blah

425
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,080
let's go back home Americans soon as
we're out the door the Americans Elect

426
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:05,650
Sharon Papo with you go right so when he
gets fuck we're like hey can you tell us

427
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,580
what you did and basically klaus fuchs

428
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,680
stealing Intel of the Americans to get
to the Brits to get our project back up

429
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,500
and start but at the same time

430
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:22,820
supplying it the russians as well so
closely examine his handler in London

431
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:28,000
he's got the plans to to Fatboy
basically stuff down his trousers and

432
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,390
little tube some metal thing right now
is this

433
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:38,509
rushing rushing case officer basically
just spoke in London right not commit no

434
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:44,070
specialist knowledge just the listening
station bomb means club suites gives in

435
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,720
the plants gives in this mount stuff
says he could care of that they're gonna

436
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,049
need it dude traps bounced off to the
side of his chest

437
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,310
sticks the the plans in a suitcase flies
out from moscow has over the plans gives

438
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,840
over the mount stuff and i'm for the
rest of his life as radiation burns

439
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:10,370
decided his ballyhooed throw eat flown
uranium 235 235 struck the side of his

440
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:16,440
body on a commercial flight had no idea
whatsoever right so if you look at the

441
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:24,300
data loss you know didn't give a lot of
data right you know some reports and

442
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,140
some files but the implications of
massive if you look at the the day at

443
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:34,490
the start of the leaked yet as a lot of
it right needs adjustment estimates US

444
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:39,020
ambassador because even general
alexander hasn't got a clue what this

445
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:45,080
guy to have been out there for a while

446
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,600
yeah you can imagine there's a lot of
David flying about reason so what does

447
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,060
it all come from so when the russians
drop their set off their first nuclear

448
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,360
weapons so the Americans the Americans
thought they would have 10 years

449
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,490
monopoly right that's what they thought
we have this game-changing weapon we've

450
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:11,259
got ten years to cement our Monopoly
within four years Russia sets off their

451
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,650
first nuclear weapon right and it kind
of scares the shit out of the american's

452
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:23,580
begins the mccarthyism trials and stuff
like this but when that happens what

453
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,710
stocks is the cold war right this is
what becomes which shapes our lives

454
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:35,780
today quite predominantly right mean we
like to believe that we don't we're not

455
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,070
in a cold war but I didn't feel much
different than it did twenty years ago i

456
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,970
mean is there still a lot of bullshit
going on

457
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:50,370
mccarthyism if we knew history batter
will call this Hoover -ism that that's

458
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:58,359
you know coffee -ism ripped America
apart right so anyone who is suspected

459
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:06,260
of being un-american aka communist was
basically black ball which is a problem

460
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:12,810
from oppenheimer because basically
oppenheimer on inspection would look

461
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,770
like a communist right his wife was a
communist his brother was a communist

462
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:23,850
his friends were communists the FBI
maintaining him from 1933 when they

463
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:28,259
reviewed his case with any any police
officer reviews your case you can hope

464
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,540
for this moment right with a wheel in a
big trolley stop to file and the person

465
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,079
book saying goes

466
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:39,890
gonna take awhile they say is the other
four you want to worry about

467
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:44,848
that's how big his fire wars spoke to a
friend recently was telling me all the

468
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:51,029
good old days prewar least had some
minor focus with tapping the

469
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:58,400
oppenheimers lawyers office oppenheimer
case review for security clearance and

470
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,359
the quote-unquote prosecution were given
tapes by the FBI of the whole legal

471
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,848
defense prior to me going in you know
let's let's just not talk about the

472
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:15,160
Constitution anymore right i mean you
don't need that right communism

473
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:23,190
mccarthyism times my interest from this
comes from article I wrote about how

474
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,029
hackers we experienced version of
mccarthyism

475
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:33,349
if you want to silence someone who
accuse him of being a happy right i mean

476
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:37,499
you put them in a jail cell five years
without telephone calls you know just

477
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:45,328
ask mitnick have now got bail hearing
right you know you can let you know I'm

478
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:50,359
not a big fan of we look at what was
done that that the whole list goes on in

479
00:45:50,359 --> 00:46:00,180
these instances and the late great great
our stores lost his life for checking

480
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:07,479
out too many library books so you know
mccarthyism still here still remnants we

481
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:10,249
still have a figure of its still there
so if you're wondering where I came from

482
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:14,669
I spent some time looking at mccarthyism
and following without way that's where I

483
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,789
got this is oppenheimer who even today
would never get fucking security

484
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:26,739
clearance right this guy put it into a
modern context this guy you were given

485
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:30,150
security clearance the guy that used to
hang out bin Laden that's basically what

486
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,499
you would be doing right i mean this guy
had so many red flags it was

487
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:40,529
unbelievable I mean and the reasoning of
a security clearance was literally a

488
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:43,180
train ride with general growth

489
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:50,879
lives in general growth asking communist
no ok but that was it

490
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,800
bank this space and so does cowboy
wasn't having any of this left the

491
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:03,339
communist look OVR you communist ok it
wasn't before this is Edward Teller so

492
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:12,020
you talkin atomic weapon is a nasty
piece of equipment right is tackled over

493
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:17,920
its weapons you can use practically what
they worked out is that they could use

494
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,900
an atomic reactions self the
thermonuclear reaction which is a pretty

495
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,339
shit right it's like a thousand times
more powerful than the most powerful

496
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:29,290
atomic weapon you can think of

497
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:34,670
there's absolutely no top to call back
to using a thermonuclear weapon

498
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:41,130
basically built bomb chicken new moscow
that's right it's there is nothing out

499
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:49,869
when they demonstrated the bikini but
they have operated the island they

500
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:55,890
tested right let's just get out of
context they blew an island away

501
00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:02,920
gone no more not know landmass gone
that's how powerful this thing is right

502
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,299
lots more far more deadly oppenheimer's
very much against the thermonuclear

503
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:13,780
weapon basically what you said was and
it's a price price right way said was

504
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,020
the only reason the russians have a
nuclear weapons because we have a

505
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:22,640
nuclear weapon and if we build a nuclear
weapon guess what the russians will have

506
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,480
a thermonuclear weapon right they built
one because of us if we do this they

507
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,920
build one because of us and needs
weapons from North tactical advantage

508
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,819
they will just and the world and it was
his opposition against the thermonuclear

509
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:43,299
weapon which inspired his hearing that
got him to lose his security clears the

510
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:48,150
guy that gave america its nuclear
project was deemed unsafe to know about

511
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,930
the new project that shit

512
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:58,149
you know it's kind of strange because we
have this insecurity all the time the

513
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,160
shit they said they were going to do
they did you guess what when the

514
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,190
russians got the thermo knew when
america made this number new

515
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:09,190
russian-made is not so long after its
all here we go with the security should

516
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:14,150
write so all the shit they said they
won't do it totally doing and why we're

517
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,880
doing it

518
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,760
cyberwar right if you wander in these
people in uniforms have a question I've

519
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,150
asked everyone why is it a drone
operators wear flight suits right

520
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,109
there's something in that logic that
just doesn't work for me you're not

521
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:34,400
supposed to be in the play is inflict

522
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,849
ok but cyber war and we said this for a
long time right

523
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:49,609
like here is something that happened in
1952 we playing out in 2014 the BMD

524
00:49:49,609 --> 00:49:57,020
which is the German equivalent of the
NSA went back to the pond stock which is

525
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:03,690
the German equivalent of the government
and said we need 300 million euros to

526
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:09,569
compete against the NSA in the exploit
purchasing business they literally like

527
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:15,390
we need more money to buy my side
weapons because the americans have got

528
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:22,680
it and they start a cottage industry
firstly I think they need another 0 but

529
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,230
this is the beginning right well now you
know you don't have to worry about

530
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:32,359
bugai's by 20 days right gonna be out
price the market by the the industrial

531
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:37,730
military complex when it goes down or so
yeah this is already starting to happen

532
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,740
when this this is just a country that
went on record with God knows who elses

533
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:48,359
start another game at some point you
have to have a snow dome comment I'm

534
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,029
kind of gratefulness known because it
means I have to stop doing some new

535
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,789
comment to let us know in comments now
show all is good right

536
00:50:54,789 --> 00:51:02,289
but basically he said you know we have
computer scientists have their atomic

537
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:11,069
bomb known and we do we pay by piece do
things his researches the scene with

538
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:16,249
outweigh them seem so important when
they connected into bigger things start

539
00:51:16,249 --> 00:51:21,899
to become more important let's get this
clear metadata kills right that's the

540
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,650
simplest are right when they launch
their attacks on bin Laden it was purely

541
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,759
metadata that they went on there were
right this time as a lot of people in

542
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:36,789
weddings in Pakistan where they were
wrong you know so when we say the Mac

543
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:42,809
sedate we know we're not collecting
content pager we're collecting metadata

544
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:47,299
people died on that share right this is
not just their i mean we teach as a

545
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:52,759
community we teach security but we have
very little concept of the implications

546
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:58,169
of where we go so it's like bill
mountain you know that's the security

547
00:51:58,169 --> 00:52:04,229
industry that broke SIM cards yay for us
you know we we screwed the

548
00:52:04,229 --> 00:52:12,319
telecommunications industry over when
you know if we look if we look at the

549
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:18,058
companies that were targeted each were
american companies targeted by an

550
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:23,719
american agency will show you what do
what look do you think the welcomed when

551
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:32,909
Google when PayPal targeted by the
nation give you some worries right is a

552
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:39,279
really shitty for you to see so sucks to
be you right so this is the budget from

553
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:45,919
2013 USA National Intelligence reached
its fifty two point six billion dollars

554
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:48,848
in 2013

555
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:56,069
this is what they're spending on spooks
Saibaba you know people where this money

556
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,540
would have trickled down to buy

557
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:05,070
HP quote just to show you that I do have
some corporate blueblood somewhere right

558
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:11,410
record 2013 the global spending on
defense products globally that's the

559
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:17,609
planet was forty billion dollars right
one country spent more on offensive

560
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:24,450
operations lot massively then we spent
globally on defense forced to tell you

561
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:32,370
something right that we are where we are
in a very very particular situation and

562
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,509
it's a lot like the military industrial
complex I feel kinda glad that managed

563
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:39,920
to go all these late lefty liberal runs
out of the way right but the problem is

564
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:46,040
is that the situation and when can you
imagine the NSA saying hey there's no

565
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,770
more threats it's all good we can go
wrong we don't need any of that 53.6

566
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:55,430
billion dollars anymore rain is a bit
like polar bears voting for blacks

567
00:53:55,430 --> 00:54:00,240
controls and carbon emissions right i
mean the military-industrial complex you

568
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,859
know and and Boeing and all these other
countries companies that make money from

569
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,090
war you have to turn around and get
these people say no is not going to

570
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:16,800
happen it doesn't happen right it's
never going to be the case you know what

571
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,710
we find is the government's will turn
for these companies to give expert

572
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:27,390
opinion on the situation so you're going
to speak to write about how safe the

573
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:31,390
world is and what do you expect nothin
to say probably gonna need some more

574
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:44,069
bombs right how many of you know what it
is quotes from war is peace is it's a

575
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:49,550
little bit screwed up with the reference
worst pieces is 1984 reference if you

576
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:54,450
haven't read 1984 don't mistake it for
an operational manual

577
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:59,540
if you have read it read it again today
with today's context right really today

578
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,950
again with what's happening and it's a
very scary read i read it just forwarded

579
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:06,328
this talk a few months ago

580
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:11,599
ready before but it was a little bit
more hard-hitting when I'm like a lot

581
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,880
worse if we did it right so much stuff
in 1984 as a little bit less horrible

582
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,810
than alright so war is peace mean we
have a system that is continually

583
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,630
designing to the European Way right

584
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:31,500
European Way is war war war that's all
we've done is a general alexander this

585
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,510
general alexander lying to his bosses
and its general alexander lying to us a

586
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:44,079
black right so yeah you can get away
with not telling the truth as long as

587
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,359
you have stripes and stars right this is
growing if you're wondering

588
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:56,410
he's the the military guy build the
pentagon is pretty cool can be a bit of

589
00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:01,848
an ass but no general alexander on so
many different conclusions a lot of this

590
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:08,650
is about the problem is we seem to have
speaking to engineers security minded

591
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:13,619
about it and your freedom is it
something as simple as knowing the two

592
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:18,839
plus two equals four support freedom
actually ultimately is right and a lot

593
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:23,270
of what we're going on now is trying to
have like asymmetric information where

594
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:28,089
people take control of Dayton I will too
when are able to share I've said this a

595
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:33,180
number of times about the whole and I
say leaks its people ban on as those

596
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:38,770
snowden you know it snowed in spied on
people's emails you know it's not you

597
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,520
know if light if the truth

598
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,550
Scrushy operations up maybe your
operations were a little bit to start

599
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:51,050
off with freedom is to know the two plus
two equals four and it's a freedom that

600
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:55,759
we're losing massively censorship so on
and so forth

601
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:59,799
and I wonder if a lot of the way how
many of you read brave new world

602
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:05,949
you know all I can say is net neutrality
right i mean if you want to look at what

603
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:10,769
damage you can do if you tend to PSN PSN
off on the PlayStation Network offer on

604
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:14,658
Christmas day right you could probably
start right well as if we turn on the

605
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:18,679
Netflix often well don't laugh and joke
but the very means that we used for

606
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:27,059
communication is is greatly being
affected with you know we are a lot like

607
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:33,829
physicists if we're not care but the
thing is people are not going to ask us

608
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:38,139
how to use our research very much longer
you know to build nuclear weapons

609
00:57:38,139 --> 00:57:41,279
doesn't require nuclear physicists
anymore right

610
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:47,019
it requires a factory and we will get to
this point in security offensive

611
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:52,638
security where does not require security
consultants talking about ethics and

612
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,849
morals to launch an attack against
anyone of us I'm gonna leave you with

613
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:02,989
her friends with this quote those who
can make you believe it can make you

614
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:07,999
commit atrocities I feel that this is
pretty rather than where we are all in

615
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:14,288
all so that being said I am a little bit
over time but your game a little bit

616
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:19,219
later if you want to get a hold of me is
less hopeful says feel free to email me

617
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:21,670
and I'll feel free to ignore it right

618
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,710
but I would like to thank you for coming
and I would like to thank you guys

619
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,010
the volunteers and you guys to thank you
