1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,260
a living

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,950
and I'm

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,960
tractor free lots of independent person
I think type 'cause usually ended the

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,730
role end up you know like either officer
or specialist or analyst but it always

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,360
ends up being the filling in for
somebody because they're looking for a

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,790
permanent member of staff or there's a
lot of business as usual work that's

7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:42,640
kind of overflowing and you can you can
handle that for us that's why I started

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,760
out in the world of tests also called
back in the days I wonder who remembers

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,650
the lovely Windows 311 and it was kind
of good times cuz you know used to kind

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,430
of go in and bring your calls out and
actually go for the building and fix

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,120
people PCs and you know what people
actually said thanks to you I'm gonna

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,509
head and enforce it for years people
don't like me an inverse

13
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:12,009
well as how I saw it was fun times and I
kind of fell into a mistake it was the

14
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,530
best kind of picture of you put it
literally fall but during some of the

15
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,530
work that I was doing the desktop
support engineer I well my boss asked me

16
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:29,009
what do you wanna come up and help me
out with an investigation come on come

17
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,280
on come on I don't know these late
coming

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:02:01,340
careful I forgot to press sorry I fell
into it thanks to clear my boss said

19
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,619
look we're doing investigations you
wanna come along help Haitian sounds

20
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:08,709
quite cool considering at the time I was
working for what used to be known as

21
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,489
Customs and Excise before they turned it
into HMRC and in the national

22
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,700
investigation service so shamelessly
supporting the guys I used to go out and

23
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,140
do the raids and the Knox and used to
kind of some of them infiltrated the

24
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,339
gangs etc

25
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,390
interesting times and it turned out that
there was an investigation going on and

26
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,640
there was some evidence being compiled
but somebody who works for Customs and

27
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,929
Excise this is a kind of rogue and he
was supplying some of the information

28
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,959
back to the people that they were
supposed to be investigating so we had

29
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,570
to kind of run up and in the dead of
night do individually server and those

30
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,280
sorts of things and kind of presenting
any evidence but it was through that I

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,540
call the bank for the info is exciting
things is quite interesting little

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,019
different from desktop support you know
I've done that for a while now all kind

33
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:06,700
of moving to investigate before I kind
of go on just say what it doesn't

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,940
contain I'm not super early technical so
this is not going to happen

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:20,250
type school but what it does contain is
how to kind of be an effective member of

36
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,180
named first team within the kind of
corporate environment is based on my

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,840
experience over the years as a
contractor having seen good and bad in

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,489
physic I'll call it copying your bubble
in the quarter environment club wrote an

39
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,040
article last year in some ways that
might be a good presentations of all let

40
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,380
me see what I can do

41
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,310
what the hell are you talking about
these bubbles I don't get what you're

42
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,570
talking about but a logo on hopefully
all kind of loosened a bit more and more

43
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:04,269
kind of you get the message in the end
so I'm not so uncommon day for me and

44
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,430
lots of people I worked with any kind of
turns out there's a number of things

45
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,210
that you do and you kind of go into work
and you kind of you and your routine so

46
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:20,970
imagine you're the kind of in the middle
any investment pros and you go in and

47
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,530
you have your meetings the meeting that
you have planned in your Outlook

48
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,630
calendar the meeting that come up and
when somebody knocks on your door all

49
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,480
kind of stands by your desk and goes
like that or does kind of free speech

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,310
free throws a meeting so it's one of the
things that kinda takes a few days the

51
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,630
other things that are kind of notices
incidence

52
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,550
because they just happen and you have to
come down with them and your dad turns

53
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:57,240
into an incident because that's when
you're dealing with views of downloads

54
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,780
of and again those that you know about
her and those that you don't you get

55
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,599
involved in those in this is slowly
beginning to kind of build your day

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:15,040
projects have done lots of work on
projects as a security consultant

57
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,150
analyst and kind of convincing the right
people that they should be engaging

58
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,390
security from the beginning and then
having the arguments that all you will

59
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,599
need a pen test here etcetera and then
kind of getting the right people to

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,210
budget all those in so this is kind of
slowly is beginning to build into a day

61
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:39,039
of a corporate influence that person

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,900
a lot of fun we document reviews almost
can you review that can you view this

63
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,020
and then you make changes you have the
other arguments over all you want us to

64
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,419
do this but we've already kind of roll
out etcetera etcetera

65
00:05:52,420 --> 00:06:00,210
so I'm slowly building up to kind of the
typical things that I've done reporting

66
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,419
it's like reporting to management or
reporting to on projects etc

67
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,280
kind of getting involved but this method
to my kind of showing you what some

68
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,700
people do with an imprint report
tomorrow morning first person so if you

69
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,159
look at this

70
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,380
you kind of go through your day and it's
usually something around though there

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,250
may have been other kind of place that
could have put in there but I thought

72
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,040
these are the ones I've kind of mostly
seen in mostly done so if you think

73
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,820
about that for a second I mean I'm not
sure if anybody wants to handle but is

74
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,469
there a pattern here i mean i'm i'm
basing it on my experience but you go in

75
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:46,700
and you do you think and you kind of go
home you're not so uncommon day becomes

76
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,090
your business as usual you're in your
bubble so essentially becomes routine

77
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,710
for you and you know when

78
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,799
picture in the background could anybody
recognize

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:14,919
but you recognize the quote if I say
they see and people often quick quote

80
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,900
him so much you know if you know your
enemy and if you know your environment

81
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,948
you 100 patents and all that kind of
stuff yet but i think is in business we

82
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:28,930
don't know the or actually you don't
know your own environment and economy

83
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:39,629
saying well ok then what do you do when
he would you do how do you actually

84
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:46,379
popular mobile so the next part
hopefully kind of trouble in a bit more

85
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:59,400
like a typical environment you've got
these lovely bubbly types of legal and

86
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,020
HRM finance the rest of departments
typical ones there's one word in there

87
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:11,590
that you have to kind of be cognizant of
your in your bubble but guess what some

88
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:18,560
of those they have their own issues and
kind of bubble bubbly type problems do

89
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,500
with so you're not the only person who's
going in to do their job to go home

90
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,020
that's what most people do so as in
prose we need to be cognizant on that we

91
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,849
can just kind of go and knock on
people's doors they were usually do XYZ

92
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:39,669
because essentially they be measured on
different things they have their own

93
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,500
targets that have their own culture have
their own team dynamics in the politics

94
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,850
within those their own measurables so
one of a kind of the messages are like

95
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,900
people to

96
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,880
takeaway is as impressive people we need
to be able to appreciate that it's not

97
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:10,270
just a small bubbles over to some places
where in the security team the tech guys

98
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:16,170
don't even like him physically there's
been occasions when people you know

99
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,280
you're supposed to be liaising with each
other and talking to each other and kind

100
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,439
of spreading the message the business
about why you should have a way to build

101
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,790
security into things but if the people
who are supposed to do that can't

102
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:32,099
communicate with each other we've got a
problem there's been a couple more than

103
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,680
one place where I've kind of as a
contractor i've landed in there and I've

104
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,849
gone to the techie guys to talk about
something and I might work as usual in

105
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,980
that sort of things and it's all the
first one who's actually come to talk to

106
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,610
talk to us and kind of actually get into
the depths of things and ask technical

107
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,470
questions and kind of probe send things
to other guys haven't really why is that

108
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,330
so well you know they come alongside
we'll do the policies within the

109
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,200
awareness within United stuff you guys
always want to come online etcetera

110
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,580
separate doing all the proxy stuff all
the technical side of things and never

111
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,490
approached us and we'll give you
approach them as well no it's a two-way

112
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,080
thing so the pain is that everybody's in
their little bubble they do their thing

113
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,940
but if you're in influencing department
and then those two don't talk to each

114
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,540
other then I think there are problems
because if you can't do it within the

115
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,339
infested apartment how do you convince
the business that you should be able to

116
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:40,110
get into things

117
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,630
so I thought you know it's a hard sell
his talk right it's not technically not

118
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:56,290
rock story but I try and introduce a bit
of a game in 2010 going good so I found

119
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,490
these cool icons right and they looked
not like people of a good place kind of

120
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:09,180
possibly which department they might
belong to write so I'm going to fuel

121
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,109
ourselves I'm seeing some people
probably recognize potentially going to

122
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,410
the arrows mean in a bit but just a bit
of fun say on the top list who's gonna

123
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:32,439
be bold enough to say what will you
think she fixing what department when

124
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:46,320
who and I found the middle

125
00:11:46,320 --> 00:12:06,310
well I heard somebody

126
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,160
I was going full year he did mommy
studio so I thought ok well then he

127
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,410
might will be in that category

128
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:26,319
potentially well as being a bit more
positive but yes then do the middle

129
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:46,350
well possibly but he resonated with ITV
and then the glass the fun looking for a

130
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,120
way to make it difficult topic to talk
to her when I hope I get across but the

131
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,760
the arrows and then the implicit pro in
the middle is like you who have a

132
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,870
department but the arrows are that
message across as you should be

133
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,420
emphasized department should be the one
that reaches out to those deposits or

134
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,349
other parts of you here there are others
in environment but you should be making

135
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,589
the effort say right ok this is what we
do this is how we do it and come talk to

136
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,850
people find out what they do on a daily
basis because whenever I kind of start

137
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,760
new role I go and actually kind of
introduced myself i'd by people of

138
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,260
coffee table thanks and jelly babies
around you know build that relationship

139
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:35,600
at the beginning with as many as I can
with their heads ideally but if they're

140
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,370
not available because usually conical
accountable tell you can gain some but

141
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,290
if you can actually going to talk to the
people who write what you face on a

142
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,990
daily basis what sort of issues you face
you i'm talking specifically from

143
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,280
personal experience and people have said
you know what you know is very rare for

144
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,189
you to communicate with us we liked the
fact that you just come to us and

145
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:03,589
introduced yourself to ask and you know
you're open and that's what I think you

146
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:09,240
have to be like that you have to kind of
make those kind of moves when I was in

147
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,589
desktop support I went to room once and
had a whiteboard right and it's a hit

148
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,310
list on it

149
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,989
and kiss which department was a top I T
and the Cauchy my head when I pick

150
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:30,210
somebody's PC and my wife and one of the
guys wearing from coming here to fix a

151
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,920
PC can you point him to write you know
put me in the right direction and there

152
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:42,040
are certain way because my tears as you
know what you're coming right you say

153
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,680
you fix something and you get lost in
the things fixed or whenever you call

154
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,520
you can inform us of the things and I
thought ok well something's gotta change

155
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,430
and then from that day on I kind of even
though I didn't have a call to fix them

156
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:02,000
every day you know just a bit of kind of
like chat social engineering but

157
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,589
building the right relationship right
and they took us at the white also right

158
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,970
and then they started calling me a magic
Modi doing right cuz I was always there

159
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,290
so whenever they wrangle picked it up
whenever they could be facing the

160
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,630
country they lost I know the cause not
long but would you have a look and it's

161
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,150
that and that's the same thing I brought
into investing and I think as people who

162
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,319
work in the industry we need to do that
when it actually kind of yes

163
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,740
distress when we have our own objectives
but if you're going to build

164
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:39,720
relationships I'm gonna go and do it in
cases of times when people sit through

165
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,980
meetings and they don't introduce each
other kind of the rights will

166
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,070
communications not been into kind of
situations where I'm gonna gonna come

167
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:56,430
say in meetings at one if I didn't have
to be there but this guy you know we can

168
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,120
come to you about this

169
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,160
you know people talk about this anymore
to be honest I never really liked it but

170
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,589
people processing technologies I think
that you know we will know which ones

171
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:19,000
the most important one of those right
but it's only one that really cool

172
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,330
actually matters is that one is always
down to the people always down to kind

173
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:34,920
of building the relationships so I
looked at politics and personalities

174
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,479
three people process and technology
novel there's something that's even more

175
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,760
critical than that it's personalities
politics and crossed because you don't

176
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,470
understand the kind of lay of the land
within your and you don't understand

177
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,290
economy into dynamics in the teams in
the cultural issues the rest of it

178
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,339
doesn't really matter cuz you're gonna
do not gonna be able to fit in your not

179
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,900
gonna be able to say right you know what
I talked to censor that links that might

180
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,540
not go off if i'm talking to a project
manager about building security in from

181
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,678
the beginning or I'm going to the techie
team to talk to change I need to build

182
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,839
those relationships in the beginning I
need to understand those three because

183
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:24,460
it's that's the key thing trust if
you've got a bill that up

184
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:35,430
I kind of slowly wind down a few
takeaways so over the years I've seen

185
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,770
kind of universal combat in physics and
then somewhere in the middle and people

186
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,940
have been contacting that brand info sit
apart but in my head over there for a

187
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,500
while I've been talking about it to a
few people over the last few years

188
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:56,640
because essentially you do need to get
out there and I would become your own

189
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,460
little startup think of it like that

190
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:07,650
think of it like you should be kind of
dynamic and actually build security out

191
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,330
and given a given name to create content
that well as they pull one took place

192
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,600
you're always kind of sending things to
people who are you should come to this

193
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,860
presentation you should kind of read
emails etc but if you flip it around and

194
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,379
create engaging content that's suitable
for everybody and has different messages

195
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,080
for different levels and put it out
there and then your branding yourself

196
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,620
properly people come and pull it and
actually look at themselves in view

197
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,939
themselves rather than using white dude
is doing is doing it this is security

198
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:43,120
a daily job to do they bring out the
personalities but this may work for some

199
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,300
places it might not work for others but
look at the people within your team and

200
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,020
actually kind of get them on the
internet do video kind of things and do

201
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,310
like little sound bites so that the
business knows who they are rather than

202
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,990
some person in InfoSec nobody knows and
then the first person that businesses

203
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,900
when they when they wouldn't be as an
interesting is that in physical and all

204
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,710
the women and they don't know that I
don't know who she is and they were seen

205
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:15,990
them

206
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:30,080
breeds you gotta go out there and kind
of sell yourself actually go to the

207
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,990
teams and actually kind of building
relationships will come out I just do

208
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,470
what about people who are not say she's
going to random counterparts hi I'm

209
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:46,510
looking for a sec and it builds up and
then slowly people begin to build that

210
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,429
respect

211
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:52,970
management has briefings and they kind
of stand up and they begin to talk about

212
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:58,610
objectives and kind of successes of the
last month I work somewhere and I that

213
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:07,689
used to happen every week they did it
when you have a little spot in there are

214
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,410
you kind of get an answer right you know
this is in first second these things

215
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,020
happen and this has been in the new
something that of the known people get

216
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:24,070
and share some data share some info you
know and people said well we've never

217
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,178
approached management to be there we
were you know nobody in the team wants

218
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,920
to do it you're trying to kind of cell
it's the business but you're not making

219
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,260
an effort to actually get up and do
anything and when you kind of got these

220
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,080
things going the last word is kind of
you know you gotta keep it going you

221
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,178
can't just say well this is a one-off
thing and we've done it now and because

222
00:20:48,179 --> 00:21:00,200
the life you want you couldn't pull rope
you need to keep going

223
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:09,460
we've got a bursting your bubble is kind
of you gotta go investigate the job done

224
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,789
it again of the same place where they
did that and it sometimes it works it

225
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,990
there's obviously places where it will
be a little bit more difficult but on

226
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,539
the whole people welcomed it when you
say hey listen come spend half a day

227
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,210
with Investec will show what we do and
how we do it and then a people

228
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,159
reciprocated so you can go and sit with
legal age are and any other department

229
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,419
within the coming so we'd like to see
what you doin within from doing that you

230
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,080
see what they go for on a daily basis
what their issues on you spot things

231
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,860
that actually does something coming up
in on it and one of the projects that

232
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,549
might help you to do things easier and
as secure as possible and it's it's

233
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:49,429
gonna be instigated by whoever leads it
needs to be able to write these are the

234
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:54,789
approaches that we need to take you to
be able to share information talk to the

235
00:21:54,789 --> 00:22:00,049
business about how many passwords we
said you had and how many incidents you

236
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:05,658
solved and build something where you
actually focus again with to sideload we

237
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:10,350
kind of do the things that nobody really
knows about it and we don't kind of the

238
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,129
word celebrate successes type thing but
you gotta share the information and that

239
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:22,220
all comes down to being open again we
all know that we we've been was it your

240
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,350
block her you know you always kind of
get in the way of us doing things well

241
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,080
if you're open and you know you share
information and instigate those who love

242
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,779
relationships people begin to understand
you better because you need to

243
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:39,990
understand the business in order to sell
yourself and actually market yourself

244
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,580
and brand the team and actually become
somebody who people can trust and people

245
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,899
can know you know i've seen someone come
you don't even know who to go to report

246
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:54,719
it to or something along those lines so
people actually build that relationship

247
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,149
you pop your bubble and that's that's
the kind of sort of take that I've taken

248
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:09,250
it over lost counting now so it's it's
actually being open

249
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:16,680
semifinals flight is done a bit
electronics in a time analog and digital

250
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,110
so as humans we're kind of unlock
reaches

251
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:26,610
continuously variable but we always
applying digital solutions to things and

252
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,560
as soon as we kind of understand that
it's all about people and actually

253
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,440
building the right relationships we will
begin to move forward and yes technical

254
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,260
solutions have their place but
ultimately it's about being open

255
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,060
doing the simple things and people begin
to actually read things will resonate

256
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,530
and actually begin to get the message
out a lot better than we have been so

257
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:58,160
thank you very much talk on

258
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,390
thank you very much thank you
