1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,490
hello

2
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:30,659
good morning I did originally was going
to bring to talks so I submitted through

3
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,330
the CFP to do talk on started testing
and they're getting scarcer environments

4
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:43,710
up and running and was in a smooth ass
on Oct 2 2010 actually that's one in the

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:58,430
same israeli everybody me so what I've
had today strong combined 22 in 2012

6
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,430
trying hits and keynote but also to
provide you with some information and

7
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,010
scarred her so I started see a thread
forming a little talk to you about

8
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,430
however there's also a third element in
this mixture and i'm looking at the

9
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,350
organizers of silicon for this bill
cannon known for wanting to do things a

10
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,140
little bit differently this is going to
be quite a difference talk they will do

11
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:30,600
normal things will go sideways shortly
commence Camry I'm technical director

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,329
encryption limited I was originally
founded the Tigers game certification

13
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:41,939
scheme back in 2007 I also who founded
the cycle scheme in 2013

14
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,189
hanging around in the information
security industry for over 17 years I

15
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:52,219
think eighteen years this year I think
about the offensive roles throughout all

16
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:57,259
of those seen a number of changes in the
developments in what we do what we

17
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:02,109
perceived to be information security and
how we go about helping our customers in

18
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:09,079
our role during during that time again
that houses talks is gonna be a few

19
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,140
minutes of some common sense normal talk
about common sense

20
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,569
followed by something which has been
dubbed blind slight not sure I think it

21
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,700
was John Carroll who came up with this
was basically gonna happen and I'm going

22
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,040
to track my flight out as long as
possible

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,769
yes I am like to turn the conference
talk on its head there are a number of

24
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,049
slides which have been crowdsourced
which will be sucked into this machine

25
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:52,269
at some point during this tour i think
im terrified apparently I'll be fine I

26
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,040
have been told the information given
isn't there are an equal number of

27
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,959
slides which contain Disney characters
to slides which contain images of

28
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,319
pregnant man

29
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:13,328
happens anyway so fine waiver testing
out something in this industry a long

30
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:18,590
time and I've seen trends come and go
over the years particularly driven by

31
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,230
the clients in particular

32
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,189
Manchester first and foremost and I
started out saying the government area

33
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,439
back in the mid to late 19th i've seen

34
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,069
contrasting what we dubbed fantastic
time going from an average of a

35
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,969
six-month engagement where we literally
given in town told nothing about it is

36
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:44,159
that right in between January and July
you'll find out everything he possibly

37
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,948
can you will get a job at a company you
will get in that you will find extract

38
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,530
all of their information in any way
possible

39
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,549
catalog document every single
exploration route that this organization

40
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,599
or company presently that was when there
were a lot of us in the industry around

41
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,198
industry specialists stuff we don't
really have a pair of NCAA with

42
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,439
interesting because I wasn't really
thinking what we found people like

43
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,519
myself moved out of that year in which
we work and consultancy became more

44
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,300
commercial we started attracting the
interest of all kinds of other companies

45
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,169
big and small thats the benefits of what
we did but they do have some kind of

46
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,710
budgets and drivers the introduction of
compliance sticking around government I

47
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,060
T health checks for the public services
network to all public bodies have to be

48
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,690
connected then including now from this
year the police sources to gain piercing

49
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,440
connection you have to kind of
protection thing that you've done that

50
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,090
and thanks in part to help end

51
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:55,198
regulated and mandated what we do now
and the way we based on price not own a

52
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:06,350
good you are

53
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,150
satisfactory regulatory compliance
around the people that are employing

54
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,830
these people at least have passed a test
within the industry people who got the

55
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,800
qualifications will have slightly
different approaches and pen testing

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,500
community has been largely constructed a
constrained and being dictated how we

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,970
actually doing things I got down to the
point where a pen test back in 30 2010

58
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,820
we were winning tests and work on the
basis that yet we continue our health

59
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,110
checking today's

60
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:45,770
how much value that I actually have
quickly realized that in having a

61
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,710
network that supports four thousand
employees being contested in two days to

62
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,349
pay for it cuz I have to have it done
now going on up there some way to

63
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,970
realizing that we need to spend more
time you need to let these people use

64
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,670
their imaginations let them explore get
that box standards mechanical pencils

65
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,920
down the way they're going through your
mind around what would you do if it was

66
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,840
an employee and company and I worked
there for years and I got to really know

67
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,590
systems IV expiration date or in
different ways that just simply wouldn't

68
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:27,280
be found on it but what are not so happy
about being street cred teeming with the

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,380
red thing now paralyzed whatever team
exercise is now is a fantastic and what

70
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,310
from what I've seen of the industry of
its social engineering team red teaming

71
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,360
is taking thermite through the door
hinges on the Rhino steel door burning

72
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,330
the damn thing down that hitting it
repeatedly with a sledgehammer to look

73
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:54,599
forward over that's right time I'm not a
big fan of the time being used in the

74
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,990
context that it is now but it does show
an upsurge in the sine wave of the

75
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,110
client's demands and clients
expectations of what we do and that

76
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,100
we're going back to Long reagents are
going back to open up the scope and

77
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,980
saying blankets go you find out what you
want to know about it we'll see if we

78
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,169
can detect your active

79
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:23,969
30 and work out what you got and that's
a healthy thing for the industry but its

80
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:32,229
maturing in a way and by that we are
really looking at is the requirement for

81
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,779
the number of princess when I started in
the industry as a people to really say

82
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,270
what they did nobody really knew you
were aware of pockets of people doing

83
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,198
stuff here and there but now it's a
career path you can go to university

84
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,969
degree in penetration testing and
ethical happy there are loads of course

85
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:56,469
is a qualified we've reached a level of
maturity now where the pen test is

86
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:01,909
having produced and push down into the
industry being created in very formulaic

87
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,539
way being given a very prescriptive
methodology and tool set to use whereas

88
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,639
the appetite for the industry is going
up for three more inventive as I'm gonna

89
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,800
hit by some very near future

90
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
skills gap in its own right now we have
people with the tail with the job title

91
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,740
Penn testers and difficult to prove that
they are without homes meet the

92
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,430
requirements getting into Penn testing
in the in the mid to late nineties

93
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:37,969
nobody knew about it you just kind of
ended up in that role as a typical grip

94
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,740
are now it's a conscious choice that
people have decided when going to

95
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,399
university or when picking their
employers but that is something I want

96
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,370
to do that's why wouldn't that be
something completely different mindset

97
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,670
people into the industry that has
matured but there are always

98
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,079
opportunities to learn not just from
happens to think I'm Pentastar

99
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:07,739
I can do the job if you think that then
we need to look at your job title is

100
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,290
absolutely fantastic fantastic have
imagination creativity that's the

101
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:19,099
defining role from each other and from
every engagement which we undertake we

102
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,699
should be learned something you should
be seeing something that benefits

103
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:25,699
before I think I've been doing this a
long time going still learn something

104
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:34,368
new every week since he would like to
see people is notion that we had an

105
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:39,660
encryption particularly hard to do with
the tsongas King station program to

106
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,929
start a Cyber Academy now that these
plans are well progressed on the way to

107
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:51,199
recovery is intended to work with
government apprenticeship scheme to

108
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:57,040
provide an alternative routes to working
information security industry now most

109
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,988
of certification schemes that are
available to focus on penetration

110
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:04,869
testing forensics however information
security when we talk about the skills

111
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:09,639
gap we're really ignoring areas we have
to ask ourselves why are they gonna

112
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,959
bilities and systems number ones there
are very very few good quality courses

113
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:22,258
and education part that people can
become developers creating robust coach

114
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,660
is really as far as I'm aware and
correct me if I'm wrong

115
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,939
a university course we can go and learn
to count see shop

116
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:36,199
securing the role of the developers to
produce CO on deadline on budget ship it

117
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:39,179
to deal with the bugs later and that's
something that really needs to change

118
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:44,899
with nobody out there addressing that
policies and documentation I'm not a fan

119
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:50,730
of paperwork but there is that wrong
people need to be defining policies

120
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,049
applying and running standards like I
think we have until I want another or

121
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,970
cause you can do to become a lead
auditor

122
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,459
verifying somebody else has done it
right where the court is to put people

123
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,579
in positions in corporate organizations
where they can start to manage and

124
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:14,238
maintain the 27th of July 1 I think that
completely absent the Cyber Academy is

125
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:19,749
intended to take people from the age of
16 and a two-year course working with

126
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,910
industry sponsorship to provide key
skills such as secure coding

127
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:32,339
CCNA CCNP deciding the STM industry
placements during those two years

128
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,490
pay them a wage while they do that and
spit them out the end well-rounded well

129
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:44,780
experienced and ahead of the curve in
terms of their skills and I can bring to

130
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,089
the industry and those people coming
through the Academy will have the

131
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,100
opportunity to specialise in defensive
policy that I'm pen testing being

132
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,940
forensics and choose the path from one
of the skills options of any doubt that

133
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:06,400
the marketplace with level of maturity
which at the moment I believed to be

134
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,550
absent that's something that would like
to watch the press this we should be

135
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,329
making some announcements later in the
year at the moment we still do numbers

136
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,590
and juggling government grants and
contracts and finding venues and the

137
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,730
first year we should be putting 25 26
people three in the first year but

138
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,700
wanted to spread the Academy's to be
available in different cities around the

139
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:39,020
UK as well as a very firm and very
definite alternative to taking

140
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:45,810
University 390 20 universities they work
for some people for everyone but the

141
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,869
option for many people who want to enter
deeply technical field going forward in

142
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,340
their career is to go to university and
leave with frankly crippling debt

143
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:00,050
whereas the alternative is there you can
sure this process and to earlier if you

144
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,870
want to sustain yourself on a living
wage throughout and leave with him very

145
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,350
very good job prospects having already
made contacts in the industry having

146
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,770
shadow professionals having spent time
in placements in information security

147
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:20,329
and industry companies finds out I have
high hopes for it it will be a lot of

148
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,070
talk about the Garda

149
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:32,270
and that was the one you promised a
highly technical talk

150
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,829
well we're not gonna get too technical
but thinking about this over the last

151
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:43,040
few days it did throw up an interesting
rounds what we do in the industry have

152
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,680
different approaches and different
attitudes people have little pen testing

153
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:55,900
tools technology in general is its Garza
sada and the reason I bring this up is

154
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,459
really funny conversation will never
forget this conversation in many years

155
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,340
ago when into a financial means to do
for a prepayment SKP exercise had a chat

156
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,850
with the tech guys find out what they've
got with her about what do they want to

157
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,810
get out of the activity and one of the
most with a question about the platform

158
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,949
the CEO's what kind of technology are
gonna be bringing in on your laptop to

159
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,500
say well we are the government job it
might be mandated school windows 7 beta

160
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,370
blocker but by and large we like to use
a Linux operating system and more tools

161
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,390
you can lock up strips quickly if we see
something we want to test now I'm sorry

162
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:45,319
its operating system that has a slightly
different architecture to win over you

163
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:57,270
mean line and this is something I find
quite often is the numbering around

164
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:04,090
round our technical approaches about our
little fortress of knowledge we like how

165
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:10,120
we do things in a particular way and
that is the only way should be done

166
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,160
everybody else is wrong and that's
something that is crippling our industry

167
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,780
many many ways and skills people are
coming out into the industry and I am I

168
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:24,630
alone people I can save you a lot of
people who fortunately gradually turn up

169
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:30,770
made it through which are made it
through commercials somehow managed to

170
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:38,260
sit in front of me for for face-to-face
interview we get that you go through and

171
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,170
the people who are you human and quickly
as possible never speak again are the

172
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:49,930
ones who I say this is you look into
that gateway what do you do if they

173
00:15:49,930 --> 00:16:00,800
flatten answer first look at a map of
the normal run this is like that of the

174
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,620
being a musical comfortable zone of
understanding what it is you want to do

175
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,510
and how you want to do it in every given
situation is not dependent on the

176
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:23,250
reasons to class Garda is because carter
also because the gaza testing industry

177
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,180
exactly that they have almost built a
fortress around what they will today

178
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,770
they put out the message that now we
know about this nobody should touch it

179
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:43,590
really shouldn't matter experts always
trying to build a fortress is around

180
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,270
themselves and treat everything has been
very very precious so I'm going to spell

181
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,900
for you today is one of those with room
for Garda technologies technology I

182
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,449
spoke about methodologies along one of
things I will firmly laid the challenge

183
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,430
to anybody who's bringing me something

184
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,849
I will paint tested regardless of what
we've looked at whether we seen it

185
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,480
before it could be a car system we can
sometimes lead pencil heating systems

186
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,140
for it really doesn't matter you don't
need to be a heating engineer to be able

187
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,329
to reverse-engineer heating system and
look for vulnerabilities so she started

188
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,889
on the counter and reflect light on this
one of the reasons I wanted this to be

189
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,730
brief reprieve actually how simple it is
what I think you might hear that

190
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,540
industrial control system not like magic
its industrial control system controls

191
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:39,870
industrial systems is probably
windows-based it's probably an awful lot

192
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,110
more familiar to you than you might
imagine but just because it's outside of

193
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,178
your fear of knowledge and outside of
your comfort zone doesn't mean that you

194
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,900
should be afraid of me at all feel that
you require mister industry experience

195
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,990
or stipulation system troops to
industrial control systems affecting the

196
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:06,320
nation from it you can't rule out
industrial control systems and scarred

197
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,939
the S&P standard office network is
basically doing the same thing you have

198
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,770
a national P trap which is not very
different systems

199
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:27,070
looking for information about the
intestines Carter infrastructure does

200
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:36,100
differ little bit different to different
to below-normal are you fired up

201
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,100
nice n Easy Street although he may not
have just hangin are still get around

202
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,409
this kind of stuff everything else is
pretty standard believe the slide to be

203
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,240
available so don't worry about these two
not a lot of the solution fairly

204
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,100
familiar to most people know my secret

205
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,620
databases which housing data this is
just a sample of technology there's

206
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:07,250
nothing really just a blip language on
the front end for replicating and I see

207
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,240
a system

208
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:17,350
tengo working as these are typically
repose I mean if everybody was talking

209
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:22,649
about with ICF daniel is just being
proposed we did you try the case either

210
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:32,820
positively and install the time that
providing the 22

211
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:43,730
follow these steps you have a completely
customizable portable ICS system there's

212
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,140
no black magic about this it is simply
technology its system employs

213
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,850
information and you are looking at ways
of communication with a system as I know

214
00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:03,020
once you find out your card controller
will do everything I just said in the

215
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,929
last 20 minutes or so but there is no
next step is whatever you want to do

216
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:15,700
this is where you can test it by
examining following a rigid methodology

217
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,190
but following a scientific methodology
to observe collect that information

218
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:28,179
hypothesize what could happen if you
press that button their proper count on

219
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:34,289
that and then test the hypotheses
observe the result for those just

220
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,250
reading cycle over and over again to
some of the tools you can use tanks and

221
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:47,669
if you were probably gonna system
fingerprinting program for services to

222
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:53,390
get some information you can refer you
look manly looking vulnerable see

223
00:20:53,390 --> 00:21:00,400
configurations look probably just
connections and systems as passwords if

224
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,250
they're in place

225
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:10,800
there is no how to do now that there is
no real how to do a penetration test and

226
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,889
surety the industry now is such that
that is what we're telling people I'm

227
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,630
pushing people out into the industry and
this is how fantastic is very good thing

228
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,910
I can tell you how I like to test that
theory how concerned should be done

229
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:36,780
anything is take the precious away from
ivory towers which people are building

230
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,780
the mint with if we're going to satisfy
client needs and the ongoing requirement

231
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,860
for information security skills in the
industry globally going forwards we

232
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,909
can't remain containerized we can't
believe that the skills that we learn in

233
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,250
one set of courses is going to have a
cool enough to push us toward an

234
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,020
actually replicate the activity of the
malicious attacker in the driver of

235
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,940
having security testing done
availability that could be found by

236
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:09,620
militias which are plentiful UK is under
attack every country under attack on

237
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,830
iraq press like to make

238
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,720
lot of figures out how much money we
lose to cybercrime and cyber attacks

239
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,820
every year we're different 21 industry

240
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:33,629
criminals

241
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:41,269
legal constraints will they do I was
thinking legal constraints and they have

242
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:46,630
the time they can spend six months 12
months however long it takes to examine

243
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:52,769
systems 22 probity different plans to
take as many imaginative routes to

244
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:56,809
getting that data that they want to
actually play and we as an industry

245
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:10,300
leader without a thought it was thinking
when I love box

246
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,870
disrespectful people particularly scar
experts are not so good experience and I

247
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,479
mess around 120 tests there are people
in a moonlighting and that's fine but

248
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,660
trying to keep all my way we should be
doing is in my mind's not the right

249
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,100
track community taking we do need to be
respectful respect of which we need to

250
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:40,149
learn from everybody and I said no right
or wrong way and that's a very brief

251
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,750
talk
