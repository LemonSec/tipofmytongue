1
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,700
so

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:23,580
yeah so we can talk about not setting
fire to Reuters I or breaking to

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,320
embedded devices

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,270
i'm sarah Martin go by influx in the
twitters 10th St Ives research and

5
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,050
forensic student over GMIT back in
armored spend half my time

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,620
yea or as Graham Cluley says immoral
unethical to it

7
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,360
we may have had disagreements about
things in the past so today I'm going to

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,390
give it gentle interruptions the
wonderful world of breaking to embedded

9
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,390
devices like Sophie probably have in
your living room so we all have like

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,720
everyone has got an internet connection
probably as a router switch you probably

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,960
got like one them play xbox some kind of
Nasser you know some little black box

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,380
which does internet which does some kind
of thing which you find useful be at

13
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,970
like one them stupid dumb as a box the
you talk to and it tells you things or

14
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,590
you know a box that gives your Netflix
or the little magical box of Internet

15
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,590
traffic go through so have a look at the
hardware and software side of it

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,850
firstly hardware and then later on
Softworks kinda go hand in hand the

17
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,630
gentle introduction designed for you
know if you've never played in the bed

18
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,240
device for this give you some ideas you
can go and take your fucking rotor

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,960
apparently came from Virgin Media which
is fully remote root phones so you can

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,270
have a lot of fun and also we're gonna
look at people actually breaking these

21
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,069
things in the wild and what people are
doing for post exploitation and how we

22
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:58,900
can have a lot of fun with that

23
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:05,050
we talked about like they've gotten bad
devices right and they've got firmware

24
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,789
on them and stuff and firm worries like
the software runs on the hard work to do

25
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,650
the magic stuff which the box does we're
going to talk about where the hell do we

26
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,550
get from where we're going to talk about
how to interface with one of the various

27
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,390
interface you can use to play with these
things which is you are which is

28
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,510
hardware interface like over serial to
USB type thing you know it's a serial

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,709
interface we can use to get a debugging
facing the devices were gonna have a

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,280
look at how to extract firmware we're
gonna do it I've got a case study in

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,380
finding a shitload of Honor beliefs
gonna talk about exploit development a

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:50,100
bit and going to win she bit about rapid
seven Metasploit amongst other things

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:57,910
have a look at a malware in the wild
which pops these things and then we're

34
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,770
gonna look at post exploitation and then
we're gonna look at some future ideas of

35
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,050
darkness and how we can have a lot of
fun and hopefully is no more walls of

36
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,820
text after this but I can't promise cuz
I put all my slides and slashed him and

37
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,079
then it rebooted my box to rewrite the
blue things so some screenshots missing

38
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,880
here in there so there is a couple more
walls attacks but none that bat vs

39
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,829
firmware I swear to god this exactly
reformer looks like you a bunch of

40
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,260
microchips 90210 or something like that
most ridiculous image at get what

41
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,720
firmware is software which basically
runs and hardware so it's the software

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,330
drives and also you've got like your
operating system allowed above it and

43
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,200
then you've got firmware which is
microchip level stuff so if you're not

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,609
familiar with firmware it's Steve got a
piece of hardware and then you've got

45
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,690
stuff on it which does stuff like
software and that's your firmware it's

46
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:02,450
it's hard to actually conceptualize and
explain if you don't know what it is you

47
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,609
can probably get the general idea
software drugs and hardware that's

48
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,700
firmware right so where do we get the
firmware for you know all these magical

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,810
embedded device for gonna be breaking
you know they all have firmware which

50
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,160
runs in the hardware we should go get it
so we can either download from the

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,050
Internet cuz some vendors are great they
run open download sites where you can

52
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,210
just pull it down and have a crack at it
or you can ask people on the internet

53
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,810
some people you know will be friendly
and provide to you so random internet

54
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,130
people or you can rip it straight off
the device or the other methods which I

55
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:44,230
won't talk about for legal reasons so
here we have dealings FTP server which

56
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,100
been submitted to the archive team it's
magical rites you've got this dealing in

57
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,760
this open activities are with firmware
for every single one their device pretty

58
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,520
much on if you run W get married they
get really upset you can get firmer

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,630
foothold advice and get all the user
mind

60
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,810
the whole lot of there so I strongly
advise have a look as we look for Rhoda

61
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,840
0 sometime later next week probably go
there you've got everything you need

62
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,570
stupid Support Center which
unfortunately isn't as easy tumors and

63
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,290
open FTP you've clicked through a bunch
of bullshit to get to it but you've got

64
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,640
user guides you go

65
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,870
firmwares you've got the whole lot you
just search by product version and you

66
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,280
can pull down there so that's really
easy to get us know some other vendors

67
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,390
aren't as nice so I thrown into the
Google machine because you'll get

68
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,620
results

69
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,580
somebody somewhere probably dump the
thing out to somewhere and then its kind

70
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,409
where we goin do stuff so we've got
extracting a divisive got the black box

71
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,690
nobody's been friendly in a provided the
vendors not providing it because the

72
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,080
vendors being a vendor you need to go
get the damn thing off the device and

73
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,539
we're gonna talk about you are here know
basically get some kind of shell on the

74
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,790
device will explain a bit more into it a
bit but and then you get the stuff you

75
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,690
care about which is normally the root
filesystem off the device that's because

76
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,630
most important expression ignore the
stock which doesn't run Linux because

77
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,590
quite frankly couldn't be bothered
writing payloads for that probably the

78
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:28,460
rest he won't do it is massive pain and
then you have a look at us so two main

79
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:36,030
ways and play with this and so you are
is universal asynchronous receiver /

80
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,030
transmitter which I did not know that
mental yesterday because it was just

81
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,849
them for pins on a device that I played
with basically a serial port though so

82
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,330
you just have a serial port and that's
quite frankly all I care about you don't

83
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,020
care about specification of it because
it's irrelevant it's only got four pins

84
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,120
sometimes see five in the pan out we
only care about 30 the rest can go you

85
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,860
know we've got received transmitted VC
which we don't care about we've got

86
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,030
ground so we can just ignore vc vc has
called me massive pains before with

87
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,590
burning out chips that like burning up
with serial

88
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,789
inverter smelting silicone you've done
something wrong I need to request your

89
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,270
life choices so that's what you are

90
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:31,130
pins look like on one device is taking
procured a sieve got four pins by Penner

91
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:38,460
header you've got just one two three
four the one that missing I actually

92
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,919
don't know what the hell it does never
bothered finding out to be quite honest

93
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:50,720
that when you take apart your router you
find something like that game on and

94
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,310
sometimes you get vendors like tp-link
who are really fucking annoying because

95
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:04,070
they remove the pins they leave you with
ads on the board which like where the

96
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,920
pins were and you can see the soldered
you know the holes they basically remove

97
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,580
the pain the soldered over the holes so
looking on you go right we've 4 pins and

98
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,300
sequence here and use D solder them
which for me was getting solar Marion

99
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,210
just stopping it repeatedly until the
holes were open again because as a bit

100
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,719
hungover and has really pissed off
because I thought to be four pins and

101
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,570
then use chicken for jumper cables sold
in place and boom you got a serial piano

102
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,200
that Roeder by the way has really take
me off that particular ones tp-link box

103
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,170
because I mixed a veces teeing ground no
ground has nothing going through

104
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,699
normally ground is just ground and maybe
an idiot i crossed over the VC ground

105
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,500
pins and VCR's 3.3 gone through it while
serial to USB adapter didn't really

106
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,360
expect 3.3 gone through ground and
proceeded to melt don't do that

107
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,490
check with a multimeter freakin act on
things otherwise been a really bad day

108
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:19,959
so talk to you our pin to talk to you if
you could buy a bus part 15 quit

109
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:27,089
interface don t want it's really slow
under the massive pain to get used to

110
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:32,160
because the documentation is absolutely
rubbish and inland based on news of

111
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,630
Figaro which ones which are you get a to
create USB to TTL converter of eBay

112
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,920
because if set fire to those it doesn't
cost much and don't kick yourself as

113
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,860
much later on they're less pretty but
the job what we're doing today there to

114
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,950
create I'd advise buying one when you're
really drunk because that way when you

115
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,700
focus up the next day can just go grab
on a spare you know live in two days

116
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:04,570
which is one of them habits you might
get into this is the red one is fried

117
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:10,529
the blue ones ok the red one died the
tp-link I've got a bunch more dead ones

118
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:15,779
that don't work anymore because again
makes up ground in VCC and you're

119
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,270
basically screwed so don't do that these
are really useful because it turns out

120
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:28,050
they can unlock Samsung phones of them
so but you've got four pins which one

121
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,569
goes we're now somebody else explains it
way better than I do so I'm not really

122
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,990
gonna get into that because they've
written this lengthy exhaustive blog

123
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,450
post on it which explains that far more
detail than I ever could be some not so

124
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,180
great words and stuff but when it comes
this kind of thing but get a multimeter

125
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,800
or preferably an oscilloscope no
multimeter because the oscilloscope I

126
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,949
solder myself together last week when
parents get china didn't want to spend a

127
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,390
lot of money buying one and I don't know
if it actually works so easy in the

128
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,339
multimeter thing is getting don't get
like a five quick Marlins won because

129
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,380
otherwise you're shopping yourself in
the long run

130
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,279
spend the money get a decent 1 I've been
using really ship model of one and it

131
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,790
does not have a proper continuity
checker so it's been a massive pain to

132
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,959
work with never going to get a good
multimeter I'll do that tomorrow and I

133
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,150
never have to just get a good one to
start out with CNN ground pin

134
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:30,670
if you get no good place look is the
Ethernet socket your device if you tap

135
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,560
one of the things if you hold onto the
internet software which is the nice

136
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,150
grounded shielding thing and then if you
probe the ground pin you'll get a

137
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:45,840
continuity tester true so basically
ground ground shielding on various

138
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,310
things you know them stupid kind of
metal cages they put over stuff that's

139
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,729
also good test on this is just gonna be
when you boot up the device it's gonna

140
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,000
be tight hi 3.3 or five depending on who
the hell implemented it will just go get

141
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,730
your three votes you've got three votes

142
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,650
3.3 or five community you and its
continuous it doesn't fluctuate it just

143
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,010
stays high

144
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,840
transmitted goes consoling kind of high
low high low and you can tell that

145
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,200
really easy with an oscilloscope or to
sit there was a multimeter in kind of

146
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,990
again questioned life choice for a while
you see that a kind of fluctuates you've

147
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,700
got like it goes up 3.3 and then down it
goes up and down because it's

148
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,820
transmitting and that's it sending
basically bits and as for identifying

149
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,860
the received in I don't have a clue
nobody does because they all bloody

150
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,680
behave differently some of them will go
high someone go low someone will do

151
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,750
weird shit some of them fluctuate
somewhat behave exactly like BCC or TX

152
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,870
pin because they're weird but if you
owned entity or expand its the one left

153
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,620
over so we found the pins

154
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,910
now we need to interact that now the
only thing we need to enact just find

155
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,810
out what portrayed the serial device
speaking on so he could do this by hand

156
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,589
I mean you could brute force through all
the potential board rates or US-run this

157
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,620
wonderful script from a guy who knows
way more than I've ever forgotten about

158
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,760
cereal and stuff and that automatically
goes through all the Padres defines one

159
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,170
that's probably the right one might be
the wrong one

160
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:24,130
usually the right one and then instead
of using many calm now a lot of people

161
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,530
say use many Compaq Mini comes a massive
pain cuz it just drops sessions and

162
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,069
generally acts like a massive various
instead use the built-in screen thing

163
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,529
which if you're unlucky be familiar with
screen it's where my IRC sessions live

164
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,680
and just do screened every 20 and then
the ball dress or whatever your serial

165
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,388
interfaces in my case I was gonna be
dead ttyl use be 0 and then you've got

166
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:49,829
whatever the hell the rotor on stalks
your cereal about you've got an

167
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:56,138
interface with it and here we have its
rotor manufactured by billion that a

168
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:02,339
co-worker made mistake leaving on my
desk it's no longer one piece of the

169
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,379
hooked up to my machine along with a
stock of other bits and taking part in

170
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:11,920
the background but that one all those
gives you a bootloader debug output if

171
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,410
you connected over you are and there was
a lot of fun because sometimes when you

172
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,540
can act up you've got a straight you get
this wonderful has prompted you go

173
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,599
got rid already and then you can have a
lot of fun sometimes get this really

174
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,860
funky u-boot shell and sometimes in that
case you just get this debug output of

175
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,029
rubbish about what colonel is doing at
that time

176
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:41,189
yeah that guy's rotors never gonna work
done by the way if you view but she'll

177
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:45,879
know they'll behave a little bit
differently to each other you can often

178
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,360
just does some debug commands in there
that you can run and jump by what's

179
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,199
effectively firmware image but it's not
quite and then you can just transfer

180
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,809
authority of TPC hook up over year

181
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:03,759
your USB to serial thing can you hook it
up over Ethernet cable just transferred

182
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,220
the entire root filesystem at yourself
over to FTP or just gives you a root

183
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,199
shell well you've got a rude shows he
just copy all the files over boom done

184
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,670
so you have to appear across Eastern FTP
server on slashing just pull the entire

185
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,479
thing down and then you've got the files
got the file structure you've got all

186
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,290
the stuff you need to have a lot of fun

187
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,420
gonna go through this bit basically I'm
gonna go through a case study that was

188
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,479
the end result of research on FB site on
over earlier this year

189
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,589
basically when extracting firmware on
scale get firmer across all devices for

190
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:52,179
certain thing and to really good example
of how shit embedded devices are this is

191
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:58,929
an example in really bad patch
management by vendor yeah we wind up we

192
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:02,550
start off with one move box firmware we
get the whole lot from their FTP server

193
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,740
mean to push it lower route else so
because I'd about a hundred and eight in

194
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,189
a minute wanna sit there running been
walking all day cuz I get RSI shell

195
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:17,469
script that wrapped around been walk and
run it there you've got Ben Walker

196
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,019
repeatedly outputting what defines which
the crime versatile system now if you

197
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,259
run then walk with the extract argument
it'll automatically extract whatever the

198
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,699
root causes missus ticket over there is
then you can deal with it later

199
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:35,029
strongly advise if you end up
downloading all of dealings FTP server

200
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,569
which are strongly advised do you want
to have some fun just run that over and

201
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:43,620
you'll end up with lots of fun for weeks
and probably question your own sanity

202
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:50,689
for a while but yet so just goes alright
we've got a filesystem let's take the

203
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:54,740
bus system output over here so we can
play with it later on and really Hyundai

204
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,829
can do a lot more useful things in that
but that's too simple and easy way to

205
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:58,378
use it

206
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:03,790
CNX top when we've got an absolute shit
load of stuff

207
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,379
script on crime offense because these
road now been walking tell you what kind

208
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,730
of fascist me dealing with here is the
most horrible piece of pipe and cold in

209
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,510
the world it does stop with just calls
the firmware mod conversion on crime if

210
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:24,629
s just jumps out all the Crown Office
file systems into a file called law it's

211
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,429
disgusting I do not advise runs and
production because it's horrible you

212
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:35,409
should probably not called system ever
but it does the thing and it don't doubt

213
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:39,360
read our faces and I was able to sit
there and go through piles of stuff into

214
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,559
differing and if you get a whole bunch
of different versions something you

215
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,559
difficult and you'd if the differences
across the Persian you're gonna find

216
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,550
loads of bugs

217
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:54,060
impacts you find all your one day you
find your ten years ago day you find all

218
00:17:54,060 --> 00:18:01,220
the fun stuff so when you find a
vulnerability in these things take a

219
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,280
fairly blind approach some people like
the guy from guys attack network

220
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,170
solutions they break out and they go
right let's have a crack at this and

221
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,420
it's way easier if you just kind of go
right where the low-hanging fruit cuz

222
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,480
low-hanging fruit is awesome

223
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,610
used kind of great for stuff even just
have a low-key can open up new debugger

224
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,639
in your disassembler later but it's when
you start off if you just kind of great

225
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,400
for things he's kinda have a look at
most the time you find a remote root

226
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,810
within about 10 minutes because these
things are really really awful

227
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:40,490
there's no security see you have a look
at the web interface with exposed you

228
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,520
know you have a crack at that first know
why does this look interesting how we

229
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:54,260
stupidly name bug this year which we can
see the Ben si links to bash the index

230
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:02,310
CGI called mash and then in the conflict
with us stuff like testified that the

231
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,600
user is root and that there's no chroot
this is normal

232
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,060
you'll find this you've got all these
wonderful options and all the wrongs in

233
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,169
these things which could be secure like
you could run is user nobody and in a

234
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,510
chroot but they're like no we don't do
chroot we want to run as root all the

235
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,590
time and execute commands and stuff so
stuff like that which ends up with

236
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,899
something like this where you write a
really awful piece of pie think some

237
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:36,510
really shitty Bosh and I'm alright a
poison to test every single version that

238
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,210
firmware for shell shocked and I was
kind of thinking this isn't gonna be

239
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,880
shell shocked you know no way

240
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,850
surely they've sort of their shit out by
now but this is vendors who kind of

241
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,570
ignore posture and you know they're
going to ship vulnerable shit for years

242
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,100
so

243
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:07,730
that's the script and that's what
happened when I ran us we've got ya got

244
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:14,240
all the all the morning the CGI script
and all them running their web server's

245
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,990
root which you know every kind of
figured out by now is really bad idea so

246
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:27,150
the results of that it resulted in a
firmware me just the results were all

247
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:34,870
under my phone bill shock all 108 the
really horrible CGI scripts 106 million

248
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:42,070
this one not load type layer of micro
during that should be running yet they

249
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,990
Thu running as root and to run late age
but they also specified runners route

250
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,110
because hey we've got a thing here which
should do proves that we've told it to

251
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,889
not do that so some engineer somewhere
has deliberately folks with the default

252
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,549
confidence software is using to make it
run in securely he SAT there and he's

253
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,350
gone my stuff won't work unless a really
break the security model of the ship

254
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:11,699
let's ship it anyway because that's what
you get a better land and this was the

255
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:18,370
end result bling bling you get remote
root everywhere so next time you're

256
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:24,270
sitting on the bus and your bit bored or
if the wifi Zach nope it's probably run

257
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:31,299
the move box you get room half second
I'm not condoning that activity by the

258
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,590
way I'm just saying

259
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:50,279
all the different versions want to see
if they didn't indifferent across each

260
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:56,590
one found for unique across the law and
there there somebody please crack them

261
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,879
has been doing my not a few people
wanted to them over here or he'll be

262
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,840
here later today have thrown GPUs of
these and I strongly suspect the

263
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,039
randomly generated because nothing is
cracked even a single one of these so if

264
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,158
you got a nice cluster buying these and
have a crack at them because I failed

265
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,820
friends when the failed crack them
thrown best 64 massive word lists let it

266
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:30,918
run for a moment so those are just tell
me this another one this gonna you're

267
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,899
going to find this here looking embedded
device along advice cuz they booed up

268
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,939
with no end because our real-time
operating system is what runs and

269
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,409
basically you're going to find the
vendors hardcode like the SSH host DSA

270
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:48,399
case and in the case of move marks also
like some random privately with no

271
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:54,799
password dump somewhere which was in EC
/ SSH key so when you look at these

272
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,480
kinda like well the device starts a new
entries are conscious regenerate the

273
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,710
keys every time of booths the end up
with hardcoded vendor specified route

274
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,440
keys left there which are never change
on reboot they've they could be but it's

275
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,980
a case of not enough and repeat region
because it starts off with the same zero

276
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,390
entry pool so you just create
predictable keys anyway so they had

277
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:27,720
called them the rubbish but you can use
these to fingerprint so the CSH key when

278
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,870
I scan using showdown have a look see
what box out there lived with that host

279
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,809
key I found two random box in Germany
which you could hypothetically login

280
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,710
without SSH key but I don't advise doing
that a published the SHPE by the way

281
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,780
it's open get help

282
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,160
don't know who these box belong to their
run them boxes that there's a sh private

283
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,540
key for for someone to music go figure
it out that lives on every single move

284
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,680
engine box ca you can just buying stuff
in the shoulder results that are bloody

285
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,890
hilarious and then as for the other sht
zones which are hard coded and advice if

286
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,960
you get fingerprinted those and you
stick him into show done you'll often

287
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,120
find that every other device made by the
same vendor as a key or every other that

288
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,120
specific device you'll find every
instance of it and the internet if you

289
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,189
scan forests ages ago or something so we
had a number with about yeah I was in

290
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,920
her so you know Boston showdown that you
know where this same box and the same

291
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:39,380
SHK that you could get into various from
over two things one of which is shown in

292
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:45,010
a few slides go see all those reportedly
uses fingerprint and you can use these

293
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,440
to identify so if you're if you find a
full moon one thing you take the SHTF

294
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,840
that box comfort you find all the albums
really honey way you know unreleased

295
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:03,260
gunner something one way fingerprinted
this the duplicate keys can everywhere

296
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:10,900
if I scroll down to just keep going he
was kind terrifying

297
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:18,050
all the things and they all the same key
I mean sh kids both piano unique per

298
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:23,919
device you know per user but this like I
was in the mood exactly the same because

299
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,200
we had coached them sleep couldn't be
bothered doing it differently she knows

300
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,760
I'd go let's find a cell provocations by
the way the device in question here did

301
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,040
SL interception I used to have a great
slide with the lovely and it's a diagram

302
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,050
bestseller

303
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:48,680
moved here but it got lost / time but
yeah it all these things they intercept

304
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:54,980
us they fire stuff off over VPNs they've
got private and public is all over the

305
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,930
shop and they're all the same across
device that's 25 someone DSL keys but

306
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,290
you'll find these things they've got all
these hardcoded certain credits and

307
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,550
stuff which are reused across the world
and our beautiful if you wanna play with

308
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,800
things and if you want inside people's
traffic you just use those and basically

309
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,460
renders all the while security by
development BPN OpenSSL absolutely

310
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,140
useless as for SL keys they were various
that sell private case located across

311
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,000
Andhra Nate firmware images there are
six but they were all on each device

312
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,600
identical and they weren't protected by
me pass phrase or credentials round then

313
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,770
you said straight-up privately so we
found out these things are vulnerable as

314
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:47,470
hell right now this where it got a bit
of a great film right next place for

315
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,780
these things so we found bugs you know
we can go find bugs finding bugs pits

316
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,910
easy anyone can do it you probably get a
three-year-old they'd find your remote

317
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,470
root in half an hour I mean when should
hire me a three year olds and a 20 day

318
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,460
in the world if they just targeting
embedded devices does he look at them

319
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,760
and they break I mean if you want to
find if you've got a router at home

320
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,200
unplug from the internet for a start for
you do this and make sure its spare one

321
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,750
because somebody something summers gonna
break horribly when you do this but if

322
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:27,770
you login you spent a perk you log into
your router through bar and this is a

323
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,460
really lazy way of finding yet another
02 in these things and then use Rundberg

324
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:41,130
scanner ago prob you come back and you
probably got like 10 command directions

325
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,840
lots of fun you know I mean peak in an
idiot could find these books and these

326
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,100
guys have no clue where anything which
is why these bugs and opium production

327
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,709
it's almost as if they're back toward
them for somebody or somebody somewhere

328
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,120
people in or something but then we going
to conspiracy line but you get route

329
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,560
ninety these things their rubbish and
nobody make secure ones if you if you go

330
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,790
where can I get a Secure Router well you
can't you're basically fucked because

331
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,790
none of these people can give it down

332
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,370
security doesn't get money shipping the
latest thing with the fastest hardware

333
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,729
does over gonna bang the same shitty
software on a sock here goes this stock

334
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:23,650
is like complex reno kilohertz whatever
shit I as he's buyin million of shipment

335
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:34,100
customers and that ISPs basically a
botnet in the fucking waiting i mean

336
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,240
this
