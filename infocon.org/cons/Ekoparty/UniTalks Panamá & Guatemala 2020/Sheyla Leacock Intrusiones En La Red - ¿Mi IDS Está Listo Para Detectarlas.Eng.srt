1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:09,670
hello everyone it is a pleasure for me to be here at ekoparty university talk

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,010
 sharing with you on the topic of web intrusions videos is ready

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,940
 to detect them

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,979
 I want to start by telling you a little about myself, I currently work as

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,840
 security test engineer in a bank I am one of the leaders

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,668
 from govern gift identifies title of panama

7
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,069
 I am an ambassador of the community foundation of both are communities that seek

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,320
 empower and train professionals in security fields

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,329
 I have had the opportunity to participate as a speaker in conferences both

10
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:54,550
 national and international level and I write security articles for

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,660
 bart the academy

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,790
 then it is part of the content that we are going to see today is

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,300
 introduction to intrusion detection systems forget for its acronym in

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,750
 english how we can deploy unidese at the web level we will see an introduction to

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,420
 pittburgh framework and finally how can we test unidese to be able

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,850
 determine if this and that is going to be ready to tempt the threats that are

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,630
 introduce him

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,189
 as an introduction to the ejido, these systems are tools of

19
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:38,398
 security that we can use to monitor, detect and prevent threats

20
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,100
 both systems and reverse

21
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,649
 these systems have a detection mechanism

22
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,140
 one of them is the rule-based one that we can make a comparison with

23
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,380
 signature of the above, that is, I will have a database of signatures of

24
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,710
 different threats that are going to contain those characteristics that

25
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,799
 behavior that in the end will allow me to identify if I am facing a

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,150
 threat determined or not then for that matter rigidities I can

27
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,220
 have a whole database of rules with those characteristics of the

28
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,220
 threats that I can use to compare each file or

29
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,270
 every packet you are getting and see if it matches some of those

30
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,650
 characteristics that I have the rules and thus I will be able to determine if

31
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,270
 is it really a threat or there is no other detection mechanism that

32
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:50,460
 It is the one based on anomalies or profile as it is usually also known

33
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,250
 what is a schema in which the system is in a learning mode

34
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:02,410
 First of all, that is, I can install this system and that on my machine.

35
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,780
 and I can put a learning mode on him, that is, he will be monitoring everything

36
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,210
 what they have done on my computer to detect all those activities and

37
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,080
 will be classifying them as normal activities

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,370
 You can detect then that I always go to YouTube, I suddenly go to some networks

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,430
 social networks that I use google to find information that uses certain

40
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,420
 programs generally and all that because it is going to be included within a profile

41
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,030
 the profile is normal from jane activities to the icon

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,730
 by the time this learning period has passed and my idea is

43
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:53,269
 is trading whenever it finds a pattern with a different activity than what

44
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,760
 that he already knew as normal for him is going to be an anomaly or a threat as

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,500
 such if he is going to classify it as a threat

46
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,050
 This is useful on many occasions, for example when we have threats of the type

47
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,700
 0 of for which we do not already have a rule

48
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,269
 identified, that is, we do not know very well its characteristics or how

49
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,400
 penalties this threat what is the behavior in these cases these

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,070
 systems of ideas based on anomalies can be very useful to detect

51
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,969
 for those different behaviors not for example a remote connection from

52
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,520
 my team at 2 in the morning where, according to my profile, I don't connect

53
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,950
 at that time and new connections to remote servers then I can have

54
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:52,250
 since this alert not that something different is happening and proceed

55
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,070
 then to analyze and we can have a hybrid scheme in

56
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,930
 This scheme is going to get the best out of both detection modes, the one based on

57
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,880
 rules and anomaly-based

58
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,430
 These judges are also classified and based on the environment, that is, if I am going to

59
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,770
 be in any environment of a wireless network if I am going to install it in a

60
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,469
 environment in the cloud if I am not going to be suddenly in my host I will be in the

61
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,150
 web level or virtualized machines are to mention some

62
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,039
 This classification arises mainly because the hidden ses must have in

63
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,380
 It has certain characteristics of its environment certain considerations because

64
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,810
 in order to be installed properly and properly monitor the

65
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,920
 different traffic we have in these environments

66
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,139
 we have implementation modes in the images you see there are based more

67
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,540
 that everything in web-level implementations

68
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,720
 in which I can have a passive implementation with what we know as such

69
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,130
 with the name of and of that instruction detection systems, that is, it will only

70
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:20,400
 be detecting it will not prevent or be any action other than that of

71
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,060
 detection and in this case we can see that we have an attacker who tries

72
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,220
 stop at the same time pass all the firewall barriers and finally reach the network

73
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,620
 internal my idea is going to be positioned here

74
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,900
 at this point and what will happen because vines is

75
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,320
 you will simply receive a copy of the traffic that passed through this medium until the

76
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,360
 campus or even the internal network then with that copy you will be able then

77
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,139
 carry out the analysis and depending on how we do not have configured, it will be able to

78
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:08,910
 send alerts generate logs not of what it found of the anomalies or threats that

79
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:16,129
 found when we have a deployment of a ps a

80
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:22,849
 intrusion prevention system that is to say that it will be in an active mode that is, it will

81
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:27,919
 be positioned within the asset as another barrier here we see that we have

82
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:36,750
 the firewall here comes the threat and my pc will also analyze in that

83
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,310
 At the moment the packet that has been arriving without analyzing it will verify if there is

84
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,990
 threats or not and there will already be some different actions that is to say can I

85
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,150
 alert obviously you can leave me the insurance we have configured but

86
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,120
 You can also eliminate the threat if we configure it, you can block it no

87
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,659
 then they have additional functions that allow you to stop or brake

88
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:10,190
 a threat before campus or our internal base arrived

89
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,590
 components of uni of s we have first the pre

90
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,190
 processors processors are plugins of the detection systems of

91
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,219
 intruders who are going to be in charge of complementing or helping the detection

92
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,089
 is done in the most appropriate way that is to say that I can have processors to

93
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,219
 when you receive fragmented packets to be able to join them fix them and

94
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,250
 send them to the detection engine there are many brainstorming techniques that

95
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,610
 may be your own that you are thinking about any other technique that is

96
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,890
 using and the processors will help us to try to support the leader

97
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,569
 in all this configuration in all this arrangement of the packets to arrive

98
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,139
 properly and if they help well from a threat then

99
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,730
 and say it can detect correctly

100
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,050
 As you see here, we have the detection engine that is the one that does well

101
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:23,219
 it's all comparison identification work feeding off the foundations

102
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,600
 of data of rules that we already have defined or the profiles that we have

103
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,620
 defined then do all the comparison if we have unit the

104
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,510
 software when all the packages that are arriving from all the information

105
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:43,019
 will compare against that database to identify threats later

106
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,060
 we have the decision engine this decision engine is the one that is going to be commissioned

107
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,739
 Well, I already have a threat detected that I do with it, those are the

108
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,730
 configurations that we have told you for example simply send you

109
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,329
 an alert just leave me the file of what

110
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:06,689
 in a database or leave it to me on the ovh server whatever that package loves not

111
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,060
 let you input remove it from the system completely all that is

112
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,099
 within the decision engine and later we have the modules of

113
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,370
 exit that are the ones who are going to be in charge of fixing that whole block

114
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,800
 all that information and send them accordingly, that is, I can be good

115
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,359
 that this information go to a database to well what parameters I sent

116
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,459
 salsa information database want to perceive who sent to the entity

117
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,059
 well, what do you want it to contain?

118
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:45,019
 so you can quickly identify all these settings

119
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,479
 we have them in the output module

120
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:57,000
 Well then, how can we display a dozen sea level?

121
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,980
 There are many ways and I'm going to start talking about snow, what is he and then what

122
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,840
 I am going to be showing you in this case it is not a bidet that you already have

123
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,120
 many many years he is one of the pioneers

124
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,620
 of the English as such is used as a basis in many others which

125
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,110
 have come out and thus allow us to carry out analyzes of different protocols

126
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,029
 detections of port scans and our primary things since it is a

127
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,610
 sniffer is to say that it will be monitoring the water in all traffic

128
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,470
 it can also be used as a package instead that is to say that it stores all

129
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,810
 that information or all those blogs and also as a detection system and

130
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,849
 prevention of intrusion in the network the acronym of iu of ps

131
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,830
 one of the simplest ways we can implement is nor in this

132
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,779
 case is through snow uterus is a script that allows us to automate the

133
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:05,320
 installation of several properly additional bare components that we

134
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,520
 allows to install components as a collector which is a component that suits me

135
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,050
 to help with all the updating of the rules yes that is to say I can

136
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,530
 configure these rules to automatically update every

137
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:26,290
 days to a certain time of night because they are updated weekly I can tell you

138
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,610
 also good just update these rule packages which are the ones that I

139
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,920
 I need for my environment the others omit the does not update them I can tell you

140
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,120
 even well we remove these rules because I will not use them

141
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,370
 I can automate all that process by power x

142
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:52,210
 go two is a converter a file interpreter yes then all

143
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,810
 the output it sends us is north, it can be interpreted and converted to

144
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,839
 several formats after this information is good

145
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,640
 I want you to convert it to me canon text arrivals or I want you to send it to me

146
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:14,380
 a mysql database all that management and all that touch interpretation of the

147
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,640
 data and the shipment I can do it also accompany 2

148
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,189
 at the end you can bathe what you are looking for to remove that weight from the and want to do

149
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,890
 all the work of converting and sending information because it is processing

150
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,020
 as such that it can impact when it has to detect certain

151
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,840
 threats and then let's say that in this case we can say let's leave this

152
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,060
 information conversion file conversion job directly

153
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,089
 advanced and watts nor it is a graphical interface

154
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:58,579
 that will allow us to read all these files or blogs that it generates is no

155
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:02,969
 in a graphical interface with all the corresponding information

156
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,379
 then with the north, let's say that by using this script we will be able to

157
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:13,490
 decide what we want to install from these four options

158
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:19,890
 let's see then here quickly a small demo

159
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,500
 from the execution of is north here I am executing the script I am telling you

160
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,900
 on which interface I want to run it and he starts first to check

161
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:39,050
 to do the download to see if we have all the necessary components to

162
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,400
 proceed with installation

163
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,500
 to move forward a little here has reached a point because it allows us to get to this

164
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,260
 snow configuration file where we can tell you well what is going to be

165
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,030
 internal state that we want to monitor that you should consider as a

166
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,500
 external network there are not all the settings as such for the ide

167
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,430
 run correctly

168
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:17,329
 then we have the options to install commands to install

169
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,610
 over here full sport and they present it to me the rules, what rules do you want to use?

170
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:31,030
 I want to download them and if you want to install Nordic webs once, let's finish with this

171
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:36,959
 and we do the reboot, we are going to have our snow or ours and that

172
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
 working

173
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,400
 let's see a little bit now the introduction to the pitbull framework

174
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,670
 when I speak of pitbull well I do not mean those who see here

175
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,920
 they put us in a python framework that will allow us to test the

176
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:07,880
 capacities and the configuration of any and of that today s

177
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,230
 what can we do with people can we simulate everything around the list of

178
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,790
 our intrusion detection systems can detect and text

179
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,890
 all those capabilities that they will have to block threats to

180
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:27,830
 detect them to alert we will be able to validate and compare the modifications

181
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,630
 that we have done in the configurations, that is, to suddenly identify that

182
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,820
 it is affecting us that the parameter affected me to some configuration that perhaps

183
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,470
 It no longer detects an important threat to me and we can compare the

184
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:50,160
 operation several times then let's see how we can test

185
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,660
 and of that as such with pitbull in this case because there are many other

186
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,579
 techniques and many other tools that we could use the pitbull already

187
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:05,039
 has 11 test modules has more than 300 test cases within those

188
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,408
 modules they took out makes it much easier what is the tests not perhaps with

189
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:14,250
 our tools spend a little more tedious have to use several

190
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,510
 tools at the same time to perform the tests but with piper because I already have a

191
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,260
 fan of

192
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,559
 already configured to put the vines to test

193
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,879
 what are those modules evasion techniques modules

194
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:34,850
 brute force denial of service modules

195
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,850
 of bad traffic, as we say, that is, the traffic of packets that do not comply

196
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,219
 with the standard that must also be met for fragmented packets at what

197
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,539
 It happens if I send all these types of packages to me, that will be if it

198
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:55,640
 will detect what happens that when this information is in how it is

199
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,560
 behaves we can also see attacks of the

200
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,950
 side of the client and we can therefore verify the subject of knowledge of the

201
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,000
 computing the ip not those that are good and those that are

202
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,880
 therefore considered as ips with a bad reputation

203
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,409
 They dispute the final offers you two types of architecture pitbull net has a

204
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,090
 client server architecture and it tells us well there is a two way

205
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,418
 ways they can implement books based on what

206
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:37,740
 want to try in this case how do you see I have a pitbull client

207
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,490
 and a pitbull server that connects or has malicious files and passes them to him

208
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,999
 customer service we have the connection between both

209
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:55,950
 and we have our and that positioned in the middle of those connections

210
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:02,250
 this allows us to test the capabilities of an intrusion prevention system

211
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,779
 because in the end I'm going to have two interfaces connected the information goes

212
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:13,710
 to pass between s ips and that way we can detect if I

213
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,509
 I can block a threat as configured and finish crashed

214
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:23,220
 totally or not or ignore it or if I tell you to remove this threat

215
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:30,179
 they block this connection, it will be that the ipc or ips will be, we can pay it then

216
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,850
 it's like an architecture in this way

217
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,750
 we have a second architecture which is what we can already consider as

218
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,540
 detection systems and that properly internally that is to say I will

219
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,928
 to have my client pittsburgh in the same way

220
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:53,059
 my pitbull server will receive malicious files on the whole server

221
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:58,389
 the rest but the connection will pass through these interfaces

222
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,669
 quietly and we are going to have the video

223
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:08,279
 corner as who would say monitoring will not receive a copy of the packages

224
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,649
 that passes between client and server pitbull will analyze that copy of the

225
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:19,349
 package and we will therefore identify if it is an ornament threat is that

226
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:25,369
 we test more than all grapevine detection capabilities

227
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,480
 finally let's see then how we can execute

228
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,480
 tests to test this ability leader with pitbull on the right side

229
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,470
 i am running snow on a fedora server

230
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,720
 get ahead of me a little here until I start executing there is receiving

231
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,370
 the packages of the transfers I am raising the instance to the server

232
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,969
 table tennis

233
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,158
 and here I have a pitbull on the client side which is where I'm going to launch then

234
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,210
 the different tests he makes me the identification of the three that I have

235
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,500
 active and non-active and start executing each of those three

236
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,260
 then let's continue here we can see that the idea is beginning to

237
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,210
 detect any of the classifications according to the rules they have configured

238
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:32,409
 of the traffic because what is happening in the network

239
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:41,170
 Well, it is going to put 323 and so we can try each of the three

240
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:48,240
 which are configured and additional once we finish

241
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,490
 but it generates some sports in which we can see graphically

242
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,440
 what was the status of those tests will not tell us

243
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,289
 whether the ide was actually detected or whether it performed a full or full detection

244
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:10,269
 We are going to see the distribution of the modules that I currently had in

245
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:15,580
 pittburgh and we will see the status of what was identified by each mode and

246
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,049
 We can see good ones that are measured if I am identifying the force attacks

247
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:25,120
 brute but not evasion techniques then we will be able to have this

248
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,309
 report with the information

249
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:39,300
 in this way using snow and pitbull we can start testing all those

250
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,460
 characteristics and all those capabilities until we realize then if our idea

251
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,680
 is fully prepared good the advantages of pittsburgh that I leave them

252
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,140
 here also as experience is that it allows us to create tests we can

253
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,700
 add if then depending on the environment we have we can use

254
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,010
 those that already live configured and we can add our own tests according to

255
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,060
 what we want to try

256
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,800
 and well that was what I wanted to share with you

257
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:20,379
 Thank you very much, you can contact me here are some social networks are

258
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,030
 my email and you can also follow me at vartan academy dotcom

259
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,760
 where you can see the articles that I am publishing, thank you all and

260
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,660
 It has been a pleasure
