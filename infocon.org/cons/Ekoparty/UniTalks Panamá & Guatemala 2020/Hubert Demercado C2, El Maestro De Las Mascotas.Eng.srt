1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:06,820
good afternoon thanks to the echo to the university and avishai for the invitation

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,740
 My name is that of the market and today I have to talk to you about command and control

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,959
 he calls it the master of pets

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,029
 without further ado I will proceed with the agenda that I have for you today

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,890
 5 things command and control does malware have in command and control because

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,899
 command and control the command and control channels and some control commands

7
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,140
 progressed for the next 30 minutes like the ones you see on this slide

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,410
 let's talk about and implants

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:51,910
 and as the communication in the implant and a command and control server we will

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,400
 starting from the most basic, the most essential, how does this begin?

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,879
 command and control the first thing one takes into account when talking about

12
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,119
 command and control is the following and I am going to mark here I am going to take advantage of this

13
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,130
 feather that is here to mark and is that an attacker a regime the reptile

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:16,030
 an offensive attacker gets in and tries to test the defenses of a

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,910
 organization sends a document that can be via mail

16
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:28,210
 this could be via a link download it by script theme whatever you want but

17
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:34,169
 that allows interaction with the final victim machine

18
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,720
 send a piece of code that we are going to refer to here as implant is implant

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,300
 nowadays it has several capabilities to put first of all the code that

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,130
 is contained in it does not include malware but using has that is called

21
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,630
 head to the beach or go down in phases which means go down in phases europe

22
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,690
 means you first sent a chunk of reduced code whose sole purpose

23
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,720
 is to communicate with a server that will be responsible for downloading new pieces of

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:17,180
 code that are the ones that begin to have more interference within the process than

25
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,530
 means to have more interference I want to be able to start executing commands and I

26
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,280
 I will be able to start sending commands and this is a process of effect of

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,300
 infection is used by malware and lately they are using it to

28
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,740
 build bots

29
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,000
 that we are going to move this a little so that it does not get in the way and we are going to talk a little

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,160
 about architectures how

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,070
 an architecture is seen there are two ways of seeing from the team's point of view

32
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,650
 robert stevens who attacks or who defends himself

33
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,240
 after rita the red team you want to go unnoticed from the point

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,440
 20 team blue team you want to have capabilities to be able to

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,900
 detect these types of threats

36
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,750
 over simplifying this architecture four components

37
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,690
 attackers the first command and control server

38
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,240
 a channel that can be anything could pass it as long as you

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,180
 allow to pass data hide certainly use it as a channel or a repository

40
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,390
 Well, the youtube twitter dropbox the levels and they placed you after

41
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,069
 store and where what is known the fourth implant point can

42
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:41,679
 interact this the most basic and call an end-to-end communication

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,689
 extreme travel here and ends here is easy to stop

44
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,988
 for a blue team because what you would be looking for in a communication

45
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,870
 between this machine that is directly infected and the steven computer or the

46
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,060
 attacker and that's what I would be looking for but the concept is quite simple

47
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,410
 four things think attacker who control to the server where are the

48
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,180
 pieces of code to which the implant is going to be communicating and a channel that

49
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,329
 in which you will use as a way to hide certainly

50
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,819
 now what happens later one can

51
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:26,840
 improve structure as improvement in this infrastructure

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,799
 least attacker

53
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:33,299
 the same server

54
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:41,000
 channel being equal you have a new element now that they are networks of

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,900
 content distribution can be web or it can be any other type of

56
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,628
 protocol that allows a distribution network is content including

57
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:52,669
 grove videos you are a good member of a content distribution network the

58
00:04:52,669 --> 00:05:01,008
 natural is behind closer is that you have a server replicated through

59
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:08,300
 a we would call inverse in various latitudes and a domain that we call

60
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,710
 useful domain that a useful domain is a domain that will serve as a front for

61
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,729
 communication with the implant the simplest way to do this is through

62
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:23,300
 of the genes if it were http one sends commands to these domains and all this is

63
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,000
 will communicate and replicate until I imagine from the point of view of the

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,010
 last the blue team it is more difficult to find me because I am not revealing my

65
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,920
 real address a tool you use later

66
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,890
 the red teams the attackers is called domain counter that makes dominant by

67
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,120
 example you grab a domain like ebay.com and the towns and he will see

68
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,130
 which domain are free similar to ebay.com that could be for example ebay

69
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,980
 white point and beige point tica or similar, that is, you can buy this domain

70
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,630
 then it makes one's job as a blues timer much more difficult at the time of

71
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:16,190
 try to register who else is there to know persistence and care

72
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,800
 as far as legal one in this circumstance what he is doing is

73
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,640
 compromising a machine remotely managing it must have permissions to

74
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,320
 do this at a more elementary level that you want to make it last on the computer

75
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,960
 it took a lot to infect this machine to keep doing an exercise

76
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,330
 analysis you do with these analysis exercises first

77
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:47,590
 you have to decide if the inputs and inputs are

78
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,320
 the elements that allow you to make reverse connections will be in the

79
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,740
 operating system registry but they will be through a scheduled task

80
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,510
 which will be in a home directory of the machine

81
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,950
 where they are going to locate it, what they are looking for is that the

82
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:10,340
 machine continue to have control and the issue of the concept of issues arises

83
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,039
 in this it is used a lot in a command and control called 8 command and control

84
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,430
 and it is quite simple, one as you want lasts to last inside the machine

85
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,230
 uses the machine as a proxy, which means that an implant can be

86
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,710
 through another implant this implant can come out through

87
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,359
 this implant and this implant could come out through this other implant

88
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,550
 which makes detecting and killing the robot network a bit more difficult than

89
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,180
 they are internally assembling the curious thing about the case that this same technique is

90
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,430
 also used by attackers to be able to persist for a long time between

91
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,580
 net

92
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,580
 it defends itself and is a technique used by persistent threats

93
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,760
 advanced

94
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:07,820
 architecture of 11-2 and now split into three points server regime of two

95
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:14,770
 implants that need first everything to be shipped should be encrypted

96
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,719
 even if it goes through https because it wants to make all this

97
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,379
 encryption even if it goes through https or if there are ssl protocol terminations so that

98
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,529
 it is not possible to perceive that commands are being passed inside b

99
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:37,719
 is where the channel that one decides to select us then command and control

100
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,578
 Jennifer items basically slow down

101
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:48,250
 requests for these implants so that it is not so predictable if they do not put

102
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,029
 implant that communicates for example every three seconds when more than one

103
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:57,910
 traffic analysis is going to notice and be good for the attacker for the blue

104
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:06,390
 timer that looks like a call home one looks for it by probabilities

105
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:12,220
 basically where you say this call home every three seconds and it can

106
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,880
 start an investigation about that that in the world I want to be her magister to

107
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,730
 one can make a variation to look more like real traffic in fact what

108
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,660
 framework that today is being released for two make this type of

109
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,870
 variation which makes the life of the attacker a little more difficult and in the

110
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,610
 famous bitcoin implant that is the call home you call home and

111
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,480
 ask the computer what to do ask for homework sleep right

112
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,160
 time and every so often it activates you again even in some frameworks

113
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,810
 you can make the implant disappear with a birthday date

114
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:57,969
 one will say how I do this and well I wanted to tell you the following

115
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,410
 about a year ago we built exactly a robot that

116
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:09,469
 used implant mechanisms and we used two things one to build

117
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:17,490
 this robot was based on slack and was in charge of performing implants already

118
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,390
 rightly artificial intelligence and is out of the two things that

119
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,260
 we use first

120
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,940
 We customized the frameworks so that they were not detected by the anti

121
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,630
 antivirus and we use as a search engine called ebulá the search engine called

122
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,339
 Ebola is so good that it allowed us to go unnoticed by

123
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:48,220
 many antivirus one could say at this stage my antivirus should save me from

124
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,939
 this in fact could be tested by testing to improve and that is quite

125
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:55,949
 efficient in what it does

126
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,819
 and this what we call calm sure they saw me and ps etc. you see it when

127
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:05,969
 we go through antivirus solutions the same account that nobody saw it

128
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:13,180
 only an actor who obviously when he makes commercial propaganda we close and

129
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,689
 It is based on artificial intelligence but it was very very very effective for

130
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:23,730
 command and control missions

131
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,550
 said everything that happened previously about command and control is where I

132
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,829
 enlisto learning about that 25 minutes I had some more tour

133
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,220
 we have been working on the needs with which we saw ourselves

134
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,640
 body have we always spend doing this in detection and attack

135
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,580
 and let me tell you about the best repository that we found just like the

136
00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:01,129
 you have seen my 3 there is the matrix 0 there is also a matrix for command

137
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:05,400
 in control and we are going to enter here I want important of this from me

138
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,400
 first change here to move to this matrix that is about to load

139
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,819
 around here using the matrix I want well what happens with this command topic

140
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:24,120
 and control here first there are three things that I want you to see in this in this matrix

141
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,300
 a one has an interface followed in which one can say

142
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,130
 How do you want to be command and control? It will tell you what software it has

143
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,490
 available but you want it to be for multiple users that is, these are

144
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,870
 those that are for multiple users want it to operate over http you want

145
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,490
 operate on ftp that is, which ones can operate

146
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,510
 taking into account according to what you select then you want it to operate

147
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,270
 so that the operating system is say what they are i see what you want i can

148
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:02,460
 do you want to have proxy capability you want the miter to have the

149
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,680
 associated miter matrix

150
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,239
 and it will allow you to select which phrase lens you want it to be like

151
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,970
 online you want it to be web what do you want to do with this more

152
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,009
 and what are the types of supports and I would like a similar website and say this is

153
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,189
 your

154
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,480
 a framework that you could use depending on what you want to do

155
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:35,600
 also in the documentation aspect there is

156
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,160
 the following first if you want to practice this is the best place to

157
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,250
 practicing sanz has something called slingshot is a virtual machine that

158
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:53,060
 you have all these control commands already pre-installed and that you could practice and

159
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,680
 The best or beautiful thing about this site is that for each of the resources you

160
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,719
 It says how or how to make a display of the people for each operating system

161
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,770
 that has a virus or windows or similar so I leave this to you so that you can

162
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:15,230
 keep watching it later and they also have

163
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,990
 developed the issue of the particular matrix sine of the matrix is ​​a step

164
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,100
 basically that they have taken the time to fill with each other's capabilities

165
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,680
 of these commands and controls what is it for that I leave them so that you can

166
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,920
 play around with them and let's move on to what this was like from the back point

167
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,620
 because it's not rocket science of me doing a

168
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,740
 a little demo on how this works first is how to create a drop

169
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,610
 box that one has access to what one is really going to be fine no

170
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,560
 dropbox that can have access to move around here I have my mix transports

171
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,040
 perfect here I have it the first thing one does when they are

172
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,569
 playing with dropbox is to create an application in which you will give access

173
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:14,300
 create some folders in this case we are going to use a power shell to pay

174
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:21,260
 play with this that is here and stop measuring me to dropbox around here me first

175
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,100
 get back my mouse that's hanging around here

176
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,310
 safe and here it is and let's play with the bots a bit

177
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,930
 I should have around here

178
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,140
 and let's go to this folder, this one that is here and I created it especially for him

179
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,750
 theme of the echo and say they really do not know how to count

180
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,860
 with this with the payment I would find three folders of this type this folder

181
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,270
 I have here are the results of the command execution in this link and

182
00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:00,029
 the tasks and the idea is to implant read these tasks from thaksin folders

183
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,439
 who is here and what would I tell him what to do and the spain is

184
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,560
 when you are going to communicate with me what type of implant I have and what is

185
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,069
 waiting

186
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:19,400
 and here the results obviously then you can do in how many

187
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,540
 and everything that can serve as a repository one can do it now

188
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,709
 let me open my console today they want how this operates and before opening the console

189
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:39,050
 the only thing one needs around here is this one that is here that will generate a token

190
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:45,199
 that will allow me to communicate it, we will from then on

191
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,730
 with dropbox

192
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,640
 and it is how you execute a command and control

193
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,840
 from work that we are to calculate well I already have some people here but

194
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,569
 let's start from let's go to main

195
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,168
 first what I am using is a command and control in the cloud using

196
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:17,319
 empire to pure covers the running inside and one the first thing that one executes

197
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:22,539
 but I'm going to go through it here, then quite simple is what

198
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:28,230
 next first a lemon what is it against that I want or that I want it to be

199
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,990
 listening can tell my machine to listen via dropbox

200
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,900
 and used the trunk dv listener which must be

201
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:49,559
 I already have it active if I run list it should have

202
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,889
 I don't have it around here, enlist this, I must have a transport running

203
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:02,850
 what is waiting for me to send command now what follows after that and then what

204
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,059
 I have practically entered that is to say this that is here

205
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,370
 although it is whistle that the one that generated above by the way the eyes change already

206
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:20,090
 let's change and he ran it to keep listening after that I'm there

207
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,500
 used something called exterior which is what they saw above and I will do

208
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:31,220
 a working workshop thought of dropbox once I do this

209
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,720
 who say the remove here I only put xx

210
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,309
 that is x they give me a little that this I can build it like anyone but

211
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:48,770
 who wants franklin who is my assistant is going to execute this power set and you

212
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:55,010
 They must see an agent in which I have here who are listeners, we are going to go and that

213
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,500
 what I have here where I see that it is running

214
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,760
 in these machines how to interact and interact with this integral machine and

215
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,230
 let's put this text

216
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:17,419
 copy and we are going to paste this here and it should be on the machine that

217
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:22,250
 franklin executed when he executes it I'm going to find this that is here

218
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,740
 a domain administrator and what is important about this franklin when he does

219
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,360
 a similar status he will see that his machine is communicating with dropbox

220
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,449
 It will not see that it is communicating with a linux that I have mounted inside and

221
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,309
 all this through other posts of those three folders that are there that are

222
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:49,460
 results that also have the theme of the packs and the sprat that is in that

223
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,270
 these are the machines with action I have a commitment and one can expand this

224
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,370
 this can get quite quite exciting and one can expand a lot

225
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:04,309
 is attack potential then from the point of view of the red team it is

226
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,720
 They are hiding from the point of view team in blue team should start

227
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,400
 to assess or inspect also this type of expected communications

228
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,320
 mainly if one uses a lot of cloud platforms

229
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,000
 let's jump to another example is the one of the sea if I have it around here

230
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,920
 an implant through whatsapp dm see if I can open my whatsapp here what

231
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:38,559
 I have it closed for sure on my machine and let me open it

232
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:45,830
 discard my annotations and I will open my whatsapp web so that they can see what

233
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,230
 I mean let's go there

234
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:57,300
 and we are going to see an implant through whatsapp

235
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,100
 once they load and whatsapp here we have a friend that we use

236
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,030
 the other robot called pink and wait for it to load we want it to load

237
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:12,730
 It is a bit slow I imagine thanks and charge although perfect I have calls and

238
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,270
 everyone everyone tried to talk to me and let's see if around here

239
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:24,850
 baby baby yoga appears, which is the one that our friend does not

240
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,219
 we have it this man who is here that is an implant this is a small script

241
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,119
 also that works as an implant that in compromised servers we can

242
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,559
 make you talk to us through passing this we develop it certainly

243
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,899
 in the offering but it is so that they see the potential behind this and if they do not

244
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:51,529
 I am wrong to ask our friend for help a gel for waiting and should return

245
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,409
 months more syntax for example already when I have this

246
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:59,269
 I have a compromised server and I could ask him to do things for him.

247
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:02,800
 command previously clear commands built by one

248
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,300
 I can ask you to start finding sentences and everyone would see that the

249
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,129
 traffic goes out to whatsapp or using in certain ways we are using

250
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,020
 judgments behind this and it is the second example I wanted to give you

251
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,580
 to this it has a very very very very great potential

252
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,049
 let's go back to the presentation to tell a little about

253
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,810
 some other things we've been doing

254
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:35,280
 and certainly we were to stop by here we stayed here exactly puts me to

255
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,700
 play from slide is over here

256
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,350
 and get where we are

257
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:54,389
 this here here here is that we are working the part of

258
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:57,959
 whatsapp and apart from similar transport we are now working on it

259
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,950
 that we call the command in control to be green so that we work it

260
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,909
 mainly when we have machines that are very difficult and we want to

261
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:13,110
 example make command command and desktop control to virtual we are

262
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:18,469
 trying to do command and control will do using word excell and the like and in

263
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:26,070
 services of the type server days and grab a black point grab

264
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,720
 an amazon and have a function in which we communicate through this

265
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,460
 document and we have command and control and what we are also trying is

266
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,620
 detect them as we detect this type of situation to incorporate them into

267
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,179
 our systems every time we see this type of technique apart from replicating

268
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,430
 there are and for the red team we try to see how the blue team is capable of

269
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,309
 spot this and this is pretty straightforward years ago

270
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:01,769
 ward treated documents twice as

271
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:06,710
 Costing punto de vélez as they were his and one can inject code

272
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,590
 malicious than being right now

273
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:19,120
 then there is also the issue of deep implantation of what we call

274
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,799
 imparts the deep first a malicious mail or similar to what

275
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,690
 previously saw to download a user who is here and let me

276
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,840
 explain why I am important because we call it deep implant

277
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:43,040
 the same scenario you saw in the first slide where you send a file

278
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:49,170
 to download and run the second user's machine in this phase that

279
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:55,110
 is here and operates in it at the user level in the world exploitation exists

280
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,429
 what is called scan action of privileges a scale privileges have

281
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:05,540
 being taking advantage of a breach of the kernel and from the operating system

282
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:12,780
 this is where most people go then one can go back to

283
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,790
 escalate privileges but when privileges escalate it is to get

284
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:22,950
 here to the firmware to the wifi what does this mean that one can compromise a

285
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,890
 machine almost permanently those who are updating is the foot the bios of

286
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,130
 the machine we are working on this experiment also from the point of view

287
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,040
 how to detect it because they are very very

288
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,820
 and the idea is to be able to detect once there is a rock and demi is flash that

289
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,730
 is here you can detect those outputs and in that what we have been working on and

290
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,540
 this has always been from the attacker's point of view now as

291
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:59,200
 from all this I come back again and we go there to put an escape here and

292
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,310
 let's see how I protect myself from these things or detecting the enemy

293
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:09,409
 we return to the womb again and I am going to leave it open later for

294
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:16,100
 Let's see a little about these topics well again the matrix as it detected it

295
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:23,969
 here is basic to do the following we will not make it load detect

296
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,210
 connections

297
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:32,820
 It takes a long time to detect the peaks that are called and detecting within the

298
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,559
 tlc if I am using it to patterns that allow me

299

 that something is happening inside me from my team

300
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,110
 for example if you have a machine that is

301
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:56,559
 calling every 30 seconds every minute 1 area paying attention and that can

302
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,610
 do with a network analysis or the like to detect a command in control is not

303
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,129
 simple, however it is possible and one has to also execute attack of

304
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:13,799
 simulation who do I recommend I recommend

305
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,610
 Visiting the matrix in fact a frank jr instructor acquires the

306
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,918
 very good matrix creator and that they begin to practice how to attack and how it is

307
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,500
 defend yourself because it is obviously a new or new three children from my last

308
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,039
 slide and I will be open to questions thank you very much
