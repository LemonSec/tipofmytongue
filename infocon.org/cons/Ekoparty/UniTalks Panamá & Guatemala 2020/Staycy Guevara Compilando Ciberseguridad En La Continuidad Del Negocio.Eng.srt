00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello, how are you today? I'm going to talk to you about the topic that I title compiling.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,830
 cybersecurity in business continuity a little about my passion

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,260
 for cybersecurity I have already studied computer networks computer security and

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,280
 Also here are my networks where you can contact me and the communities to which

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,199
 that belong as an agenda we are going to touch on issues of resilience continuity

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,699
 business and cybersecurity bsp cybersecurity perspectives in the

7
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,559
 company connecting with senior management strategy proposal benefits

8
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,899
 return on investment and soft skills I want to start

9
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,350
 providing with the resilience sector which is the ability to anticipate

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,789
 prepare to respond and adapt to changes in order to recover and

11
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,469
 recover from an adversity or contingency in order to survive and

12
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,620
 to flourish

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,660
 in the same way we have business continuity is the ability to continue

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,959
 providing a service at the pre-defined acceptable levels, sections the

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,770
 incidents that cause an interruption of the organization's activity a

16
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,420
 bsp in the tool that guides us and helps us make this path the least

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,090
 traumatic possible cybersecurity is the

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,200
 practice defending internet networks that information, applications and

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,960
 Malicious attack data is also known as security technology

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,169
 information or electronic information security what you are looking for

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,159
 is to guarantee the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the

22
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,320
 information cybersecurity has a business-wide scope by

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,309
 which is an important pillar for business continuity managing the

24
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,659
 Business continuity is key to ensuring the digital future of a

25
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,800
 company before possible incidents of different natures

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,470
 the business continuity plan or sp we must start by visiting the

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,610
 risks such as its probability per impact how likely it is to occur

28
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,869
 we must use probability estimation methods for example data

29
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,740
 historical data of what has happened between the organization as well as opinion of

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,630
 experts within it we must make an identification and management of

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,220
 risk based on impact and occurrence making identification of the

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,780
 main threats and vulnerabilities what are the consequences evaluate the

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,410
 value context assets threat models consequence analysis

34
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,970
 direct, very direct, we must also carry out an impact analysis on the

35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,290
 business so we can find out what the risk appetite is

36
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,989
 what is which is the risk appetite with which the company is

37
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:53,349
 can withstand an incident of any nature also be able to identify

38
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,879
 costs critical processes the pathway is another element used to estimate

39
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,899
 the impact that an organization could suffer as a result of the

40
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,739
 occurrence of an incident or a disaster identifying which part of the

41
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,430
 company are the most critical for it to survive

42
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,760
 After we have the risks we already have our impact analysis at the

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,090
 business we must raise what is our response and recovery plan

44
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,569
 that we call the erp that the rpp is to define the strategies, procedures and

45
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,958
 controls to define the recovery of operations until the occurrence

46
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,420
 of an incident or interruption within the added values ​​that we can

47
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,958
 obtain from a rpp find that we can strengthen the ability of

48
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,980
 recovery of the organization allows to show the critical processes and to know

49
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,918
 its impact on continuity and improve the critical criteria of the processes

50
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,060
 critical issues and knowing the impact on business continuity improves

51
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,750
 cybersecurity controls both the competitive advantage over our

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,459
 competitors that will be less resilient not an image of trust before third parties

53
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,019
 and regulators provides us with cost reduction by reducing the impact of

54
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,459
 possible incidents and interruptions and helps to generate more coordination

55
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,049
 between the different teams of the organization

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,650
 that we have to make a test plan as well, we already have our rivers that

57
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,500
 we have your analysis and business impact we already have our plan of

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,370
 disaster recovery and now we need to test that

59
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,590
 this plan is effectively working properly and we must do this

60
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,489
 do at least once a year with exercises step-by-step analysis or

61
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,820
 simulations this allows us to find faults and account for changes

62
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,880
 corporations over time but also caused a good

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,090
 impression before the general management the cybersecurity perspective in the

64
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,979
 company is that we must focus that cybersecurity is a risk of all

65
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,750
 the business but not only a technological risk cyber risk is not a

66
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,440
 Information technology problem is a business matter and is a

67
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,940
 strategic operational there then we must associate our risks with

68
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,450
 digital innovation and then found a balance between the need to

69
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,120
 be able to protect the organization from assigning threats and the need

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,520
 good businesses and new strategies that capitalize on technology and that

71
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,330
 next on the foundations for future success what are the goals of the

72
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,409
 organization so that I can define my scope of I will have them very clear

73
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,150
 If I know where the business is pointing, I will be able to have all the

74
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,099
 critical business processes that I will need to preserve what is its

75
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,419
 confidentiality, integrity and availability then we must perform

76
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:48,030
 what is a cybersecurity risk assessment using the best

77
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,388
 practices to identify the main risks of civil lord and

78
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:55,229
 those who are aware of our organization that this could

79
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,699
 affect business continuity such as assets threats measures

80
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,330
 that we are going to take estimating the impact and risk that isr your investment what

81
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,260
 can only what can pass the risk analysis what has us

82
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,099
 provided the information to decide on the allocation of resources

83
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,530
 whether they are technical to another type in order to protect the organization to determine

84
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,888
 the significant risk that we can determine the assets relevant to

85
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:25,199
 the organization and its interest and its value in the sense of what cost

86
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,309
 would have the degradation of that service or that asset, we must also determine

87
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:36,449
 what threats are exposed to those assets determine how

88
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:42,479
 We are effective against risk, estimate the impact, we must also estimate the

89
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,610
 risk defined with the impact weighted with the rate of occurrence or expectation

90
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:54,110
 materialization of the threat to be able to connect with the high

91
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,520
 management we must know the business and have an attitude of knowing about the

92
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,889
 business what are the organization's goals

93
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:07,099
 so that I can define it reaches me if I know where it attaches the

94
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:12,229
 business strategy I will also be able to associate with what I am going to

95
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:19,130
 preserving or I will care for the organization's critical assets is also

96
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,229
 It is important to know who your audience is to understand the questions that they

97
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:29,030
 they can have how they think or what they can think and it is also

98
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,359
 important that we can help you indicate how we reduce risk

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,300
 IT of the organization and be able to optimize the security budget

100
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,009
 IT if there is something critical to business continuity and any

101
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,949
 executive is looking for cost control and channel enablement

102
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:56,330
 virtual machines to maintain continuity that allow us

103
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:03,258
 see show them how we suppose how we are going to be able to how we are going to be able to give the

104
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,210
 face to face some regulation in a way of strategic approach based on

105
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,080
 risk management establish security as a business enabler

106
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,500
 in the same way, we must have a meeting with the various business units

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,960
 under a purpose of trust since every digital strategy must include the

108
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,419
 safety as a priority objective

109
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,829
 We must also demonstrate in what are statistics reports of how they are

110
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,320
 currently what is cybersecurity at the global level at the country level already

111
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,970
 regional level here I present for example it is important that we can

112
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,370
 show how the risk level is at a global level as here in the case of the

113
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,950
 risk report of the very large economic forum this year where it is within the

114
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,320
 main risks of cyberattacks in the same way also here it is with the

115
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,050
 invoice of what are the attacks at the country level we have to that of the map

116
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,180
 of kaspersky at that time when I took the capture appeared two attacks a

117
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,079
 attack in two or three attacks in Panama which is

118
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,070
 doing at this time likewise it is also important that

119
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,840
 we can tell you how the industry is where we are by

120
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,480
 Here we also have an example of the survey carried out by w a c in this in

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:40,370
 this year 2020 where the main reasons for fraud issues for companies

122
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,400
 organizations is cybercrime as they can visualize it this way it is very

123
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,689
 important that we can also show you news of what is happening

124
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,330
 currently depending on the area where we are, for example here we have the

125
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,210
 when leaf I want the database of the chain of 100 course that inclusive

126
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,380
 they printed on the printers of the invoices in the rescue that were

127
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,950
 also requesting when garmin lost it was for during

128
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,930
 about five days out and administered the seizure as well

129
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,899
 when mapfre overcame the cyberattack he left behind

130
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:27,920
 without working without being able to work 90% of your employees how much this is quantified

131
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,498
 of the loss approximately 3 points although 6 million dollars lost more

132
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:38,089
 In that freer moment, he also executed his contingency plan

133
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:41,480
 the cyber attack that is part of the business continuity plan

134
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,750
 to avoid that the operations of the insurer will be stopped

135
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,970
 Likewise, we also tell you to bring a news story where there were hackers who

136
00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:00,410
 they were selling at the entrances to the ATMs of medical banks

137
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:06,150
 likewise also some statistics that he thinks that of those critical times they see

138
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,689
 tours where cybersecurity spending will exceed one million dollars in 2021

139
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:19,110
 in goose damage costs grow more than 57 times by 2021

140
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,730
 Cybercrime damage costs will reach 6 trillion annually by the

141
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:31,040
 2021 8 billion is the cost of the global economy in 2022 in cases of

142
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,469
 cyber crime and 3 points 9 million global control romeo for attack

143
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,070
 in the same way I wanted to show you this image where it says how we are before

144
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,250
 have an incident and how are we spec and if the budget is also found

145
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:57,100
 we can can I show you is a page from a kaspersky calculator here

146
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,630
 in what gives us the information of how is the security budget

147
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,890
 computing in others in other companies that has helped us to do as common

148
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,030
 comparative and therefore also show how much they are investing and

149
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,699
 when we are investing we, for example, here we can seek to reveal that

150
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,180
 we can search for all industries of a company that have at least

151
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,120
 1500 employees and has a budget of m

152
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:32,210
 of 44 million 454 thousand dollars

153
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,520
 and that we can make the calculation for each a comparison of how of how

154
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,350
 we are then that our company does not have the trades invests the

155
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,170
 enough in computer security since the average is much higher

156
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,250
 then it is important when when we are going to present this what we can do

157
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,050
 this type of comparison then left you there in the link so that they can

158
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,240
 use it if you haven't used it before

159
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:07,229
 and we continue here with the presentation we can also

160
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,949
 show you graphically how we are going to present the commands

161
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:15,870
 current acceptance graphically with a percentage of 2 senior executives

162
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,250
 like the percentage and graphically how the organization is shown and we can

163
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,449
 show a proposed situation is to say if we make the investment that we are

164
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:30,660
 proposing for example that we have in what is the effectiveness with a 75

165
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,800
 percent but if we enable this solution of

166
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,290
 security can then increase it to 82 percent and there is a big change in

167
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,920
 that and that budget that we are requesting can and can be sustained

168
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,810
 In the same way, we must base ourselves on proposed strategies with frameworks of

169
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,310
 reference for example we have the anise we have the iso 27001 we have the

170
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,888
 controls systems also the cobisa here we also have water

171
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,970
 web applications which can help us to be able to be able to us the power

172
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,380
 turn off leverage in these frames of reference as organizationally we

173
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,730
 We also find it important to demonstrate the profitability of the

174
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,980
 investment in security what that return will be in a more tangible way for

175
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,540
 to justify investments in security is to classify them in three levels as in

176
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,260
 the effectiveness of safety such as risk reduction and

177
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,250
 profitability for the company where the effectiveness that is the protection of

178
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,149
 people and assets and be able to demonstrate the value of safety effectiveness

179
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:43,339
 since companies do not when they end with certainty simply if they have

180
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:47,000
 an incident occurred or if the security solution prevented such

181
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,620
 border incidents can also reduce the investment of

182
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,440
 capital and operating expenses that may be later applied by the

183
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,790
 risk reduction that is aligned with the goals of the executive management of

184
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,599
 how the organization would benefit financially by protecting itself

185
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,950
 against these risks what is the profitability when safety

186
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,670
 contributes vitally to the success to the profitability of the opportunity of

187
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,140
 business in organization is achieved by determining the way in which the

188
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,670
 security technology can add value by making basic processes

189
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,689
 of the company are more efficient as well as our profitability of the

190
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,940
 investing in security it is important that you have a strategic approach with

191
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,140
 objectives of the organization understanding the mission

192
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,439
 and ensuring that all activities are planned and

193
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,560
 executed to satisfy those objectives of the organization as well

194
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,989
 know what are the different laws and regulations that govern the organization

195
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,640
 to be able to have a have a reputation from the framework of the

196
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,930
 organization according to regulatory needs the management of the reputation of

197
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,400
 the organization and the expectations of the users, being informed of the

198
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,030
 consequences for the organization's activity and proposing the measures

199
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,510
 opportune to adapt to the new regulatory framework that is being given according to the

200
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:22,390
 long the area where they are and all in a way of an approach

201
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,010
 strategy based on risk management in the same way also without doing

202
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,689
 the adjustments in the solutions according to the changes that are being

203
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,420
 making the organization to present a moment with a lot of

204
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,969
 organization are carrying out the digital transformation of I go to the

205
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,730
 current situation also in the profitability that is going to be

206
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:51,079
 a capex that is the investment expenses is exactly when a

207
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,040
 business invests in the purchase of a fixed asset or to add value to a

208
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,980
 asset that is already within the organization and extends beyond the

209
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,839
 year available then they are used more than all that is capex for

210
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,270
 purchase or upgrade them antirust such as equipment include an account of

211
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,879
 asset that is made which is called capitalization and what it does is that it gives

212
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,970
 an increase in the base value of the asset in the cost value of that asset that

213
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:29,330
 fair for tax reasons to be able to give it as an investment within the

214
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,158
 see it as an investment within the organization we can also

215
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:40,190
 talk about opex which is the opposite of capex in what

216
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,910
 what is operating expense the day-to-day expenses of the organization

217
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,810
 what is the sum of all the operating expenses of the same for a

218
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:56,889
 period of time such as a month or a year and that it really is not the same to invest

219
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:05,270
 in some printers for example the role that would be an ex than in a printer in

220
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,710
 3-d to deliver some production chain within the organization that

221
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,010
 in this case it will be a capex, it is also important that we can develop what

222
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,530
 which are soft skills since we need

223
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,020
 develop skills in depth human capacities and in the same way

224
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,260
 professionals since the role within cybersecurity is a highly

225
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,830
 strategic this is important that we can have what

226
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:44,510
 what is strategic planning adaptation negotiation skills

227
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:51,290
 of innovation leadership to focus on financial acumen risks not

228
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,850
 we are financiers but it is important that we know the basics

229
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,830
 that they will be able to help us to raise our budgets of average

230
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:06,050
 in the short medium and long term within the organization I hope to be able to

231
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,770
 see what are the projections also also have an intelligence

232
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,420
 emotional and ease to be able to communicate between the different areas

233
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,430
 since they will be the strategic allies to be able to carry out the

234
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,570
 what is our investment in the cybersecurity of the organization

235
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:32,220
 and now the prop is right now if you have any questions

236
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,220
 Thank you
