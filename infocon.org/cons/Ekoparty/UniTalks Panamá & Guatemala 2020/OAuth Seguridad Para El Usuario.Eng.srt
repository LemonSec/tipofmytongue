1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,260
good afternoon to everyone present at this cupping event and first of all

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,030
 I appreciate the opportunity given to us to put this research project that

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,480
 we have made our presentation at the university on web security

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,130
 It is about why you, which is a mechanism that helps us protect ourselves

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,769
 everyone as a user in any web application

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,430
 as following the point we have to be in covering different topics

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,760
 as are some introductory concepts that we must keep in mind

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,230
 account at the time of treating how out we will talk about the operation of this

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,339
 mechanism through graphic definitions to be able to understand the

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,129
 yourself also about the benefits it offers us and why it is so important

11
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,640
 use them as a web application developer and finally we will be

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,160
 exposing some vulnerabilities to which it can be subjected and how

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,300
 we could improve it

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,409
 The three of us are students from Panama at the technological university

15
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,750
 We are a software engineering student in the fourth year of the degree and a student

16
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,119
 of the subject of web application security

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,800
 good headline in news like these are the ones that are currently presented in

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,670
 the media to panama there is no time when pages are not reported

19
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,530
 fraudulent web servers mobile devices hacked

20
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,830
 or those who suffer cybercrime in Panama, many are the victims who day by day

21
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,360
 day they are increasing with this type of cases because there are no no

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,310
 laws that regulate these crimes or we do not have those laws because the

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,600
 web security are the measures applied to protect a web page and

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,289
 ensure that these data do not exist are not exposed to cybercriminals an

25
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,119
 of the tools to combat this and developed by specialists in the

26
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,460
 security area has been the lockout security measure that regulates the

27
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,920
 login in both software and online banking or web applications

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,049
 social networks and among others

29
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,470
 in the next slide what you see what we see are three different scenarios

30
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,800
 where the first where you are granted permissions to publish or access photo in

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,180
 your value in the second would be the online banking of our country and in the third

32
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,460
 we see the mail application what these three scenarios have in common is

33
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,320
 that go through two similar processes that is authentication and authorization

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,649
 now some introductory concepts in the first we see what is being

35
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:08,670
 authentication that the process of verifying an identity in the second is

36
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,440
 authorization, which is the process of verifying what a user

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,109
 You can make and in the third party the consent that your permission gives

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,459
 to the app to do something

39
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,269
 Now in the next slide we see what the example that has been

40
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:33,150
 is a remote computing device that communicates with a network to which it is

41
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,040
 connected to the authorization equipment we see that it has used for the

42
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,980
 interaction with users when they have to identify themselves in the application

43
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,840
 and the tokien empoli is used only by the machine without interaction with the

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,730
 user as the next point we have the scouts

45
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,319
 which are permissions to do something within a protected resource on behalf of

46
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,170
 user these may vary depending on the

47
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,230
 environment that is, they are not the same in all cases

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,140
 in this slide we see two examples of two web applications on the left

49
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,349
 we see that we are being authentic two and in the second we go through a

50
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,229
 consent is now missing what the authorization is and in which part it is

51
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:29,409
 We can see well the authorization would enter what is being out or

52
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,139
 out began in November 2006 when blake developed the implementation of

53
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:42,240
 security for twitter then we will see what its out and how it works

54
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,729
 Well as my partner said that I play auto waters a framework that defines the

55
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,290
 rules in which a web application can access data on a server

56
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,410
 This regulates the way in which the client application can receive the

57
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,120
 data as long as the user gives him permission to do so

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,180
 Following we have now how it works wow

59
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,960
 now we must highlight important terms has two versions

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,870
 We will deal with the 2.0 below and we will know four terms that are what

61
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,470
 more important, first we have the owner of the resources that we are

62
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,790
 second, the client, which is the web application that wants to access this data under

63
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,320
 your name following the authorization server that is the one who manages the

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,480
 authorization requests and finally the server of protected resources in the

65
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,310
 which is where we have our data saved and through an app and

66
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,530
 we access from an api

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,969
 the first step on this slide is for the owner

68
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:56,308
 from resources log into the application followed by this the application

69
00:05:56,309 --> 00:06:01,480
 client will ask for a token from the authorization server

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,160
 now what the authorization server will do is ask the

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,210
 quarters if you gave it permission to the app what the user will tell

72
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,808
 yes the web server the server

73
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:19,489
 authorization will give the application token which you can use as

74
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:23,950
 a key to access the user's data on the resource server

75
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,090
 continuing with the other slide we have the application gives you the

76
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,880
 token for the resource server to validate

77
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,270
 then once the touch is validated on the resource server, proceed to deliver

78
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:47,930
 the data requested by the application and this would be the flow of the out process

79
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,480
 as the next point we have that here we can see 11 of the

80
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,919
 processes through this summary graph where the customer requested a

81
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,210
 token as the first period followed by the authorization server asks the

82
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,448
 owner whether to grant the third touch or not the owner authorizes the delivery of the

83
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:15,960
 touch the fourth the authorization server delivers the touch the fifth

84
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,719
 the client requests the data from the resource server continuing with the

85
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,280
 sixth which is the server of the resource validate the touch and finally then the

86
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,020
 resource server delivers the data

87
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,770
 Following below we have the benefits of wow

88
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,599
 the first is that it shares data anonymously the second is that it exists

89
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,849
 many tools that allow their use for third-party developers is that

90
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,800
 you have token with limited time and finally it is that it is an encrypted protocol and

91
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,490
 insurance

92
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,979
 well then we will see the other demonstrative theory that has been

93
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,279
 previously executed but we will be applying through the captures of

94
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,240
 screen obtained

95
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,710
 the requirements to carry out these laboratories are to have a machine with

96
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:20,530
 ubuntu clone repository install word suite install npm install mont

97
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,950
 we will be working on a photo portal from a hip hop repository

98
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,400
 once we have had it installed from the website that we see on the screen

99
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,520
 We will proceed to find the vulnerabilities that have the

100
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,590
 implementation of out and this application

101
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,769
 as the first vulnerability found we will see the reuse of tokens

102
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,270
 as we are the user we will log in through the home portal

103
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,250
 we enter the data and we will enter

104
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:05,040
 once inside we will see the screen to grant permissions we will give you to allow

105
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,370
 we see that on the board if we get an answer

106
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,609
 has been able to revive the application portal

107
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,360
 having the answer in the board suite what we will do is send the answer

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,510
 to the bus repeater and we'll see what they threw at us

109
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,079
 with all this we see that using the token that had been generated the first

110
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,730
 time we have been able to access again using the suite which shows

111
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,790
 this first vulnerability of this web application

112
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,760
 as a second vulnerability found we will see how to access a token does not go

113
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,150
 bound

114
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,440
 We access the portal from the beginning of the application

115
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,490
 we see in port suite that it gets a response from the lines that s photo prime

116
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,890
 we change it because that key

117
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,890
 once this screen is up, we will allow you

118
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,819
 We see that the attacker's page alters us in this we will change the url in

119
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,750
 the browser for the code they are giving us we copy as we see the

120
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,140
 password

121
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,720
 and we see that we have been able to access the application without even having a token

122
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,950
 that has been validated

123
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:58,600
 then we are going to see the improvements that can be applied to wow

124
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,660
 among the characteristics among the shortcomings excuse us we obtain that

125
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,180
 this itself is only an authorization framework followed by which it is not capable

126
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,219
 to identify users

127
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,510
 as a next point a solution the ethical man is thought for the

128
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,730
 authentication unlike world for authorization this one adds the

129
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,160
 following functionalities that complements water much more as they are

130
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,270
 touches in haiti that lets us know who the user is

131
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,050
 a new point and use info that allows us to retrieve more information from the

132
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,420
 same user a set of standard scope a set of klein that we

133
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,479
 allows to have data of the subject in this application we do not understand each other due to

134
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,380
 which would be very long but it is important to note that today it can be improved

135
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:06,420
 As a last point to conclude, wow, it is one of the 30 important that we

136
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,180
 as software engineers we have to know and apply since without

137
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,160
 we would be making the task easier for cybercriminals who are

138
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,620
 around the world as we said web security is the

139
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,330
 necessary measures to provide a page and ensure that the data does not

140
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:33,900
 fall into the wrong hands and through the application of uaw security is a

141
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,400
 as you can help us regulate this attack and protect us from

142
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,459
 cybercriminals and finally we give you we give

143
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,128
 Thank you very much to all of you for your attention

144
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,489
 Thank you so much
