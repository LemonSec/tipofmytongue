1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:09,129
hello good afternoon thank you very much for having us here today we are going to share with

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,320
 you guys talk include security poster uex and low cost tools and

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,840
 awareness this is to improve your security posture with sis tools of low

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,779
 cost and awareness I have introduced myself my name is sheila pérez I am

5
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,609
 Engineer in telematics systems graduated from it and has a

6
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:37,000
 master's degree in systems management with computer security and

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,090
 I currently work as a senior systems analyst in one of the ports

8
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:50,140
 of the country I am an ambassador member of the community foundation I give

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,670
 and member of human security charter panama

10
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,080
 that we will talk today good to improve the defense and security posture as

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,980
 we achieve this as we evaluate our current defense scheme and how we use

12
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:15,910
 controls as frameworks to evaluate our defense system and how we are doing

13
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,789
 to introduce what low-cost opensource tools are to what is

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,450
 our

15
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,820
 our group of tools to implement for our

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,850
 our improvement in the defense scheme well let's talk a little about what is the

17
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,860
 defensive security remember that defensive security is this set of

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,850
 essential and vital activities within an organization for what is the

19
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,720
 defense of the data truth the team that is in charge of doing these tasks is

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,860
 calls him blue team that leads the blue team that is in charge of the tasks

21
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,190
 inventory monitoring management vulnerability management what is

22
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,889
 patching data protection limiting accesses among other tasks

23
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:17,850
 what day by day they perform is this team true then when we speak

24
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:25,019
 To strengthen that defense, we once looked for a computer security project

25
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,810
 however every time we think of a project

26
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,370
 come to mind because we immediately have a budget

27
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,440
 budgets assigned for these security tasks sometimes we do not have it

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,209
 organizations not always despite the fact that they already have a conscience and have

29
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:51,510
 become very aware that events and every day there are more attacks

30
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,269
 and they want to invest in cybersecurity because there are not yet others that are made

31
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:04,870
 blind-eyed to this situation and the budget always on one issue but

32
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,319
 what happens that even though we do not have an assigned budget it is always

33
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:19,018
 and it does not exempt us from the responsibility to protect the information then here is

34
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,499
 where are you these schemes of

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,770
 of support and maintenance in open-source tools that come out a lot

36
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,470
 cheaper than paying for a commercial tool

37
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,730
 stronger licensing and maintenance that would go a long way

38
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,859
 more expensive then let's see for those who are not familiar with

39
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,260
 cis the center for internet security is the center for

40
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,569
 internet security this is a non-profit entity

41
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:01,450
 whose mission is to identify, develop, validate and promote what

42
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:07,268
 are best practice solutions for cyber defense based on the

43
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,870
 experience they are based on the experience of

44
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,250
 professional cybersecurity and ICT teams from corporate governments and

45
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,530
 organizations and educational entities of the academic area so that for the

46
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,859
 development of standards and best practices

47
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:35,770
 This is where controls and controls are born and have have

48
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,969
 go back to its beginning have its beginning for her by the year 2008 when stands

49
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,949
 institutes creates them as a project and this project aimed to create

50
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:55,930
 a security framework but already focused on the computer field then they create the

51
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,680
 Cinemas project with only this best practices security framework

52
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:10,680
 It also has 20 controls, there are 20 controls that are

53
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,250
 they are in charge of giving us the best

54
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:24,760
 practices when it comes to defending against attacks and threats

55
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,550
 known base a lot what they contain and how they make the

56
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:37,840
 prioritization of risk and threat mitigation in what is

57
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,869
 a compendium of current attacks and all the security measures that are taken

58
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,759
 to remedy them are in the public domain and can be

59
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,860
 downloaded from the link I'm sharing in a spray so the

60
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,710
 I invite you to go to the legal site and download them

61
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,580
 they are basically divided into three groups the basic group the group

62
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:10,440
 fundamental and the organizational group the basics comprise the actions

63
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,570
 elementary that an organization must have implemented would include

64
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,760
 from inventory management to vulnerability and configuration management

65
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,980
 safe in hardware and software equipment

66
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,820
 among others, there is also the monitoring of what the audit logs are

67
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,690
 passing then to the fundamentals which are the following 10 controls that

68
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,130
 They go a step further and recommend what the implementation is

69
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:45,760
 of perimeter defense of defense against malware and tools already

70
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,640
 attack prevention account monitoring data recovery and

71
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,219
 support of the information and finally the organizational ones that are the last

72
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,240
 Four controls out of the 20 already include actions at the organizational level that

73
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,360
 involve the work of interdisciplinary teams that are in charge of

74
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,590
 create awareness plans and strategies or response plans

75
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:24,599
 in the event of incidents and even the implementation of penetration tests

76
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,550
 The is control uses the 80/20 principle which is the distribution that

77
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,210
 found Wilfredo Pareto at the beginning of the 20th century in which he saw that in his country

78
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,219
 Italy 80 percent of the wealth was only 20% of the

79
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,900
 population realized that this distribution was seen along other

80
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,859
 from other other life situations and you can turn it over to cyber defense now

81
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,580
 the other 5 about 80% of the risks can be mitigated if

82
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,460
 we implement 20 percent of the controls let's see

83
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,270
 as first control and most important good back on both sides control

84
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:19,820
 united that inventory has been, invites us to invent devices and

85
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,290
 authorized and unauthorized software so that to have visibility of what

86
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,600
 what we have within the network if we do not see what we have we do not know what we are going

87
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,940
 to detach therefore it is very important to have the visibility of the teams

88
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,620
 hardware over all our assets within connected within the network and

89
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,450
 for that we bring these three examples of software that support this control

90
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:50,660
 space works in one of these software that is free is free software

91
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,140
 fast installed is downloaded, it is installed and what it does is scan

92
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,090
 immediately your network and find any device that has an ip within the

93
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:07,430
 network there begins to invent what is the hardware that has these two

94
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,290
 cpu disk memory characteristics for example in case of a

95
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:20,290
 This computer will find printers and offer you the life of

96
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,310
 the view of how it is in the printer cartridges

97
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,529
 if it lacks if it lacks ink for example of me

98
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,870
 quicker mind show them

99
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:44,810
 so for example we can see if how are the ink cartridges not

100
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,900
 can display operating systems or 40 sides

101
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:59,740
 shared network general information of the equipment then we also have

102
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,710
 the aitor and manageengine act explorer ay top tool is based on the

103
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:13,400
 best practices from you is already much more advanced and is open source can be

104
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:20,300
 installed and is an excellent tool for what is inventory and management

105
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,819
 of the management of it and act explorer of manageengine if it is paid it is commercial

106
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:35,410
 and comes in manas engine core stock suite of a type and solution

107
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,949
 unified in point management for the administration of servers teams

108
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:48,819
 laptops smartphones and tablets among others true

109
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:54,160
 These are for the first control that I wanted to mention to you, the one that follows comes

110
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,868
 being what continuous vulnerability management is, this is very important

111
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:04,250
 because because having already inventoried seeing this

112
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:11,580
 raised the inventory of software equipment of your hardware

113
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,290
 and then proceed to look for those possible failures or breaches in security

114
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,150
 that could be exploited by threats

115
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:26,240
 continuous vulnerability management helps you to do that and invites you to install what

116
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,890
 which is a vulnerability scanner that is continuously in charge of being

117
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,230
 reviewing the possible actions of your assets is this then it will help us

118
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:42,350
 to lead the entire asset prioritization discovery cycle of the

119
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,880
 evaluation of what we are going to remedy from the risk report that we are

120
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,280
 running from remediation and immediate verification of what we have

121
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,160
 applied remember that this cycle must be constant that if we apply

122
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,850
 a remediation today and tomorrow that team is not in me within what

123
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:11,160
 In this control, the patch cycle is also included because a

124
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,980
 vulnerability may come to a higher degree that an update is needed

125
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,480
 then the patching cycle also starts with the inventory that's why it is so

126
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,730
 important start with the inventory after this see if there is availability

127
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,550
 of updates for that software looks like hardware if it is not there anymore

128
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,150
 supported because if it is not supported then we have to take an action

129
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,470
 about the truth after that then also validate

130
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:47,840
 validate that those patches are applicable to

131
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,900
 Not all of our teams are going to apply, so we start to evaluate

132
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,720
 which of them are the ones that can be applied then we are going to create an area of

133
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,980
 test that we are going to test those updates before putting the

134
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,370
 production always test updates before putting it in

135
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,410
 production once we have verified that we that although the

136
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,000
 implementation has no adverse situation

137
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,770
 then we deploy in production that is why these two cycles are so important and

138
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,150
 for this we did then bring the tool of its essences and open bass

139
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,250
 for the part of the vulnerability scan that is one of the

140
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,710
 tools that invites us to install the control without number 3 which is the

141
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,970
 continuous vulnerability management mehsud essentials is as it says there

142
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:48,560
 essentials we can and scan up to 16 ips and open base yes

143
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,579
 It is open source and we can scan in quantity of equipment with all the robustness

144
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:03,350
 that has the software from the feeds and daily update that both have

145
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,000
 tools give us a report without saying what is the risk we run, how

146
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,650
 we can mitigate and the criticality of the vulnerability

147
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:19,689
 found as to what patching we started quickly and

148
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,950
 mitigating what are the risks in microsoft software updates

149
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:31,460
 as easy as installing or enabling the role of w sus within a windows server

150
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,560
 to start downloading and centralizing all the updates that microsoft

151
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,589
 releases every Tuesday every second Tuesday of the month

152
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,690
 additional to this we brought then as an example also pacman yesterday plus

153
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,590
 patchman yesterday plus is from manna changing also comes within the from stop

154
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,440
 central suite or comes for major stand alone installation from patch manager

155
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,610
 has an online demo has an online demo or quickie I'll show you this de

156
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,780
 one line allows you to see the full capacity of

157
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,970
 of scan and visibility that could have of

158
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,010
 all of all assets all software in systems

159
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:30,040
 operations of your organization and can

160
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:36,100
 We will prioritize allows you to prioritize since you are going to install which are

161
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,649
 highly vulnerable which are healthy which ones you need to work

162
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:47,980
 because they are vulnerable etc. but it helps us prioritize gives you the

163
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,720
 visibility of what are the patches in the balance of the operating system that

164
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,170
 you have installed which are the light [Music]

165
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:04,699
 the latest vulnerabilities that have come out that we need to mitigate

166
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:17,090
 here for example here is a scope of 10 teams six of them are green gp

167
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,670
 and four highly vulnerable of the highly vulnerable we can see by

168
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:31,939
 example here we can enter here that says it needs 33 third party patches

169
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,220
 he needs he is going to list what are the third-party patches that he does for

170
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:43,209
 this tool is very very good the following control and quickie to

171
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:48,469
 continue is the one of secure hardware and software configurations

172
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:54,770
 In this we use two tools one of the six benchmarks that are the

173
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,279
 baselines offered by sis

174
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,119
 are consumption documents in which they indicate the

175
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,958
 best security practices to have a good team or good software

176
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:19,809
 tuned in equal security issues and I share the link

177
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,928
 what is

178
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,789
 I already show you

179
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:33,039
 there is a list

180
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,168
 20 months

181
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:43,820
 for all for amazon for linux surf for apache configuration

182
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,720
 for windows in all versions and open cup which is the other one we have in

183
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,730
 open exhaust screen

184
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:01,309
 This is a compliance tool, it scans a computer and compares it with

185
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:07,040
 some baselines and tells you look inside the best practices that I have to

186
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,379
 you need this this and this and then it helps you to

187
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:22,060
 compliance with that best practice within the asset that you are and evaluating

188
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:29,019
 the next control that we are going to see and go from defenses against malware well

189
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:34,000
 remembering that malware is software that is designed to harm or

190
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,269
 intentionally interrupt access to a

191
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:42,999
 the computer system will not gain unauthorized access to a computer system

192
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,690
 good control

193
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:53,080
 the control of defenses against malware that 8

194
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,178
 invites us to do the installation or instructs us to implement tools and

195
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,740
 automated to control the installation propagation and execution of

196
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,530
 malicious software or code then our organization

197
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:15,370
 recommends us you can use anti malware tools that collect now

198
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:20,040
 the reputation information of files to install tools

199
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,030
 automated to continuously monitor in our teams of

200
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,160
 work mobile device servers

201
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:36,168
 for this control that we did bring in what are the ideals that omidyar is a

202
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:43,630
 determination of take a response how to tell the evolution of viruses

203
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,620
 because this no longer only detects and warns but proactively analyzes

204
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:57,129
 any behavior and allow you to act before any

205
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,600
 infection then as examples we brought here to

206
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,250
 its use and and test or sec or I know it is a software

207
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,910
 free open source defender that comes with a

208
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,730
 host and that children ips that are instruction

209
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,560
 detection system text instruction protection system what it does is

210
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,110
 analyze logs and monitor everything that is windows logs in

211
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,770
 real time

212
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,679
 which is very important on the subject of the characteristics of the videos because you

213
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:45,399
 immediately alert to an abnormal situation performs analysis and verification

214
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:52,899
 file integrity log monitoring detect rootkits too

215
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:58,110
 can alert you for an active response in real time

216
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,820
 works now with linux open open operating systems

217
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,980
 and in windows [Music]

218
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,309
 in May it is also aimed mainly at companies the

219
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:19,980
 large companies that already need training detection systems in

220
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,409
 your servers and the other tool we have here

221
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:30,639
 is open and diaz open and day a couple of weeks ago with comfortable mode

222
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:35,639
 I release how it thought to happen

223
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:42,520
 and they are they took him with all the ability to implement rules of

224
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,668
 Personalization level detection

225
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:54,429
 and all that it entails

226
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:01,460
 the review and the one and the analysis of indicators of compromise

227
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:08,020
 they monitor in real time the existence of a computer detects threats

228
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:14,690
 and with an engine that it already has, it leads to recommend you and warns you about the

229
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,780
 steps you should take to mitigate something you are encountering

230
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,178
 within the network then here I share the links so you can go

231
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:30,370
 to see them and they can download and test them

232
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:36,549
 for this for this control we also have two there are two more software that

233
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:42,950
 they do this function one is or blue and the other is the high project

234
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,430
 The next control is the response to this incident in the response to

235
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,830
 incidents because, added to the other controls, it helps us protect not

236
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,639
 only the data of the organization but its reputation here we the cis us

237
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,100
 invites you to develop and implement an infrastructure

238
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,090
 incident response so that we can detect

239
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,090
 quickly

240
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:18,990
 not rather detect my reactions quickly to an incident then when

241
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:24,259
 to do this we need dis to do this we need a plan

242
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:28,730
 develop a plan that contains

243
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,860
 that contains the roles of the people at the time of an incident that

244
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,928
 is what each of us is going to do then we must create

245
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,280
 well-written well-detailed incident response procedures

246
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,960
 that include this definition of roles, constant tests must be carried out

247
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:59,200
 practices of the same scenario until it is already internalized because each time

248
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,690
 we will do faster then the faster one responds to an incident

249
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:11,559
 faster the organization recovers and returns to its operation then this

250
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:17,830
 control what it does is this protects us in addition to the information the reputation

251
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,230
 of the company because it does not leave it out before responding until an incident

252
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,049
 leaves out and interrupts service for too much

253
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:38,360
 time here you work with a playbook with templates although this is not always

254
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,900
 as the last thing you are going to have the playbooks help each other however there are

255
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,220
 tools that can also support incident responses and here

256
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,890
 Well, we brought two and one that they have on the list d

257
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,610
 or did he think that I

258
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:08,619
 what is for blue teams this is the velociraptor but if for a while what it is and i know

259
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:12,549
 It consists of such a tool for responding to incidents but also

260
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:15,990
 includes digital florence

261
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:23,580
 he actually creates and collects information from the end teams and creates what is

262
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,540
 they call artifacts what each thing is that it detects for then later

263
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:34,700
 do an analysis and leave project that you leave project has been

264
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,530
 and it works a lot like a flow in which you collaborate after having detected

265
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:46,580
 something then several departments can work together

266
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,000
 to be able to respond to a situation

267
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,590
 The next and last control that I am going to share with you is the evaluation of

268
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,340
 security skills and adequate training, the entity control invites us

269
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,840
 practically identify knowledge skills and weaknesses

270
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,699
 of our fellow collaborators within the company why

271
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,470
 we must develop these specific skills to protect

272
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:28,419
 data and therefore we must also create a system

273
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:35,540
 a training plan for each of the roles within the organization how

274
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:41,480
 is achieved, we need to carry out an analysis of what the gaps are to

275
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,049
 see what skills we need to reinforce in our employees and to

276
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:50,440
 implement

277
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:57,929
 what type to implement other controls for example we need

278
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,490
 analyze behaviors

279
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,320
 that are not adequate and that we are seeing that our employees are

280
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:12,570
 making them give them safety capsule awareness programs

281
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,990
 always be showing them information to turn on LEDs

282
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,910
 the chip that I need to always be aware that I can not be

283
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:29,970
 using for example few robust keys that I can't be

284
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,440
 handing over my key to another that I shouldn't be clicking on any

285
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:41,840
 link that I get that kind of program d must be constant and

286
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,870
 To be carried out now, this is a little more preparation and for this

287
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:53,120
 tools there are tools to test for example phishing

288
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,820
 there are tools where scenarios are created

289
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,550
 and they are put to the test then and ss

290
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,810
 that maliciousness of the user if they really open or open an email but for this

291
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:13,879
 we brought us was 2 in kits and templates that he offers us in the

292
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,110
 national institute of standards and technology and the sas institute that we

293
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,429
 then offers a security awareness planning kit which is a series of

294
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:29,280
 step documents to create your program

295
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,700
 training pardon and anise also offers us a document quite

296
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,679
 complete in which we can support and adjust it to our needs to

297
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,870
 start from less to more and then this being the last the

298
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,668
 last control that I am going to present you, we are going to close

299
00:28:52,669 --> 00:29:00,240
 definitely defending the organization is crucial and fundamental

300
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,720
 that if it is one of the very good and recommended base tools to start

301
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,610
 and even and strengthening through its three groups

302
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,689
 the defense scheme that we have

303
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,610
 as we saw there are many tools that we can use to be able to reach and

304
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:28,049
 achieve the implementation and strengthen the security scheme without spending much

305
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:33,539
 money then I invite you to look for these tools that we have here that

306
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:37,350
 we have presented that I share with you in this slide too

307
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,780
 links that have thank you very much for your time on the day of
