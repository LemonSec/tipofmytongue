00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:12,000
hello friends how are you health amilcar de leon guatemala thanks for being

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,500
 present and this talk in the framework of the ekoparty criticizes Guatemala and

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,980
 Panama, good for me, it was a total pleasure and an honor to be part of this

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,090
 activity and well today I come to talk a little about what it is

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,890
 social engineering and more consistency and that I particularly find very

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,490
 interesting and what I want to share with you

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,020
 very briefly because I am a cybersecurity consultant for the entire

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,000
 group and well I'm also out there involved in some

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,550
 communities and mainly everything that are websites and some other little things out there

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,430
 but good to what we come to, which is good social engineering and generate

11
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,780
 social various concepts that can define it to me I particularly like

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,979
 much this concept that says that social engineering is the art of deception

13
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,740
 the human and because I really like this good concept at the end of the day

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,740
 social engineering like everything in this life can be learned if it can be a

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,619
 science too, but in reality art, let's say we turn to artists to

16
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,750
 to be able to do this type of activity on high that if we want to call them

17
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,280
 somehow with practice like mistake with a lot of effort with a lot of passion

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,460
 also when we talk about social engineering because there are many concepts that

19
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,880
 this of this topic that many think that social engineering is simply deceiving

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,449
 or just improvise actually improvisation plays an important role

21
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,659
 but there we will see in the parents likes how an attack can be more effective if

22
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,630
 we have a lot of information about our victim versus solar only to arrive and

23
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,399
 do a simple improvisation of course improvisation is part

24
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,590
 of the show there are also other concepts also very attached to my beginnings

25
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,600
 social such as pretext or persuasion and robbery, deception and fraud and

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,060
 if I watch smishing well a lot of things out there what I want to tell you

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,739
 With these schematics there are many concepts out there involved with and turn your

28
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,010
 brain but there is a methodology also behind spears a little what

29
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,679
 I want to share with you today but also when we talk about the

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,840
 social engineering we must know that aspects of

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,800
 psychological manipulation why or for what for victims to execute

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,900
 improper actions or in the particular case of companies disclose

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,790
 potentially sensitive and attractive information for attackers yes then

34
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,840
 let's say from the perspective of an ethics from here for example where

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,040
 we as consultants decide security we are hired by companies

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,980
 to violate systems in this case we must violate people yes and what is

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,119
 the target of such an attack when we do exercises of this kind

38
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,770
 organizations specifically the objective is to be able to evaluate the

39
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,810
 people's behavior before this type

40
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,430
 attacks yes because because organizations today well know

41
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,230
 that there is a lot of technology that helps to identify prevent and block this

42
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,720
 type and other types of attacks such as malware etc. but it is not 100%

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,960
 infallible if it is not 100% safe we ​​must sensitize our

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,420
 users and the best way to evaluate if what we are doing in

45
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,369
 terms of awareness is working is to do

46
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,260
 and well how do we do an attack of this type a social engineering attack in

47
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,370
 Let's actually see them that malicious actors probably don't know what

48
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,010
 There are methodologies, phases, etc., but in practice they do it and today I am going to

49
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,599
 make known how it should be the methodology for their kill that

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,710
 good of this and of various types plus what we see on the screen unknown as

51
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,180
 the pyramid of social engineering basically this tells us that we continue

52
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,350
 these passes to the letter our attack is going to be very successful it can come

53
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,460
 to be hits as this pyramid is interpreted basically it would be interpreted from

54
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,859
 top down then as the first point we have something

55
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,740
 her name is she wolf in shorts intelligence basically the five is the

56
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,850
 most important phase in reality of any test of instruction even not

57
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,380
 only the issue in terms of social engineering but this means

58
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,670
 being able to take advantage of open sources or basically everything that is so

59
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,170
 public on the internet, as an attacker I am going to collect the

60
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,190
 more information about my victim to know what his

61
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,680
 habits what are your tastes what are your places of preference what kind of

62
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,740
 soccer is going that she likes to eat where she works that her husband than her

63
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,730
 wife who in their children where their children study use a service

64
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,920
 from google all these kinds of questions then

65
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,790
 collecting information can take any amount of time

66
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,260
 It is not very complicated actually because today they know that there are many

67
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,400
 things published on the internet I really like to do there because the

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,270
 Real observation for the comment of what to do the synths

69
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,740
 like this that stopping people not stickers are good to do or

70
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,190
 sites then we see here we can compile any amount of

71
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,550
 information exists in fact a very good very good

72
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,810
 framework that helps us to do or if I am going to show you like this in a very

73
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,460
 brief one of these

74
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,150
 of these of these tools

75
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,560
 give me a second over here

76
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:32,020
 it is called framework basically the or without framework is an index true a site

77
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,128
 website that gives me a series of recommendations for sites or tools

78
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:41,740
 that you can use on the internet to identify specific information

79
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,360
 then it is cataloged by grouped by type of tools for example if

80
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,319
 I want to search for user names, I click on this option that

81
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,539
 displays a series of options if you want to do email identification

82
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:00,729
 electronic because there are messages there are a series of options information

83
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,539
 domains ips information etc. then basically it is a catalog of

84
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:09,009
 tools really suggested of course this is not and is something very

85
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,639
 important that I have noticed this type of tools for example

86
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,750
 is that many of these filters have a lot of information for example if

87
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,430
 We are looking for victims on the US side, for example, but suddenly the

88
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,990
 from Latin America or particularly from Central America to me what particularly

89
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,170
 that never fails me is the social networks 'facebook' linkin

90
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,410
 Above all and well of course some of the tools that are here

91
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,740
 So what I want to tell you with that is that there are already a series of tools

92
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,500
 that make it much easier for us to find information and this is not at all

93
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,840
 an illegal activity here what we are doing is searching the internet for all

94
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,940
 that information that is public on behalf of the organizations or

95
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,810
 people, for example, in my country, I came across many institutions

96
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,650
 that make available to the public tools of

97
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:06,349
 Petro consultation of cards of other things, true where with a couple of

98
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,550
 things that we know about the person we can make inquiries on the basis of

99
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,780
 data and get a lot of information and that is not illegal that is to say these

100
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,390
 organizations have made available to the citizens of the

101
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,659
 platforms to make inquiries and what we are doing is using these

102
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,860
 platforms to make inquiries because there is nothing illegal is nothing of the other

103
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,610
 world but the amount of training we can

104
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,039
 find on the internet even this linux distributions that bring

105
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,870
 tools for 05 but the topic is it's nothing to write home about it's nothing

106
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,400
 complex only takes time and of course for the current malicious

107
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,209
 for attackers motivation to want to do the damage

108
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:55,018
 then the next easy the development of the pretext basically the pretext is

109
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,800
 well, as the name says, give the pretext with the excuse or theme that

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,139
 we are going to choose from all that information that we collect in our open phase

111
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,009
 You are smart, we must choose the scenario that we are going to use to

112
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:13,019
 our pretext is to say of all the information that I obtained from a victim I

113
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,269
 I can choose, for example, to pretend to be the pizza delivery man, yes or to do

114
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:23,699
 replace with the person's bank or impersonate their boss or pretend

115
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:28,559
 go through a seller an insurance broker I do not know there we are going to have a

116
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,689
 lots of information to choose from, that's where I already tell you that it starts to be a

117
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:38,089
 narco because we can choose anything and you have to be true

118
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:44,879
 certain expertise certain tact to be able to discern between which is the

119
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,779
 adequate pretext with which we are going to make our victims fall into

120
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,880
 attack like a hoax

121
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,350
 then we have the plan of attack this is where we can mix

122
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,850
 what is the pretext of the attack scenario with technology for example by

123
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,390
 what because here I can say for example well let's do an attack of

124
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,870
 phising and I want for example then that we need to do this already

125
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,710
 we have all the information we already have the pretext but we need a

126
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,940
 technological tool that allows us to make difficult attacks and how

127
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,330
 we are going to do we are going to spoof we are going to buy a domain with an error

128
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,770
 typographic etcetera or in the mail that what is going to be to go for the objective of the

129
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,800
 mail we are going to make users click on a link we are going to

130
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,640
 steal credentials or we are going to attach a document with malware by

131
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,540
 example to be able to take control of the device is there since so

132
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,510
 inclusive how creative we want to be because it is already another 20 pesos later

133
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,860
 we have the execution of the attack this is already doing the thing as such and it can

134
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,410
 be as long or as short as a simple 30-second phone call

135
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,540
 and with 30 seconds he manages to steal the information

136
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,290
 But to be able to make those 30 second calls believe me we could have passed

137
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,699
 hours days weeks or even months collecting information from our

138
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,649
 victim in order to know with what tone we should speak what

139
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:17,600
 questions to ask when telling a joke ask about the news I don't know

140
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,310
 why those 30 seconds of phone call or face-to-face interaction

141
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,529
 be effective and we manage to extract the information we are looking for

142
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,939
 and last but not least the most tedious part for everyone who

143
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:35,959
 we do cybersecurity and for everyone in general I believe to make the reports

144
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,790
 the reports that our clients pay us at the end of the day because

145
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,248
 We have to present written results, evidences and indicators because

146
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:51,529
 even because it hires a company to an ethical one to do this type of

147
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,939
 issues because they want to identify true failures possible points of

148
00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:01,319
 vulnerability and obviously improve then we must document

149
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,670
 who invented this image well the author of this pyramid is Mr.

150
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,689
 christopher hanna gates the lord who is around here

151
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:15,099
 Christopher is a guru of all things social engineering, he is the author of several

152
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,029
 books like the one we see on the screen which is the second edition of the book that

153
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,589
 fact is called the science of human hacking the first edition is called the

154
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:29,410
 art of human here I recommend them and I'm not going to give you spoilers but if you read the

155
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,189
 books are going to know because the first book refers to the art of

156
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:37,959
 hacking people and the second book says it is not science that or

157
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,300
 people I invite you to read them my excellent and good book chris has more than 20

158
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,800
 years like this doing that kind of thing he's the one

159
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,319
 soul the new jack villette leader with

160
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,790
 true what we actually see on the screen as it is the ctf in action where they

161
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,500
 they basically make phone calls in real time with the goal of

162
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,720
 extract information and they do it because they like and are passionate about who is

163
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,959
 the bottom I do not know if they can distinguish it is

164
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,459
 Kevin and you are the most famous hacker in the world that I really like to do

165
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,609
 this is this note always because they see you minutes is a very technical person sakis

166
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,570
 they know their story they know that i'm wanting a farm i think of the phone system

167
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,820
 etcetera but he says look at companies spend a lot of money on technology

168
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,470
 but they neglect a very important part that is the weakest link that are the

169
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,570
 people yes and unfortunately for people there are no such as patches

170
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,200
 of software with which we can correct them so that they do not fall into

171
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,860
 hoaxes now is not like an update on

172
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,210
 actually this patch does exist and the patch is sensitization to

173
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,200
 users to teach them how to identify

174
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,510
 x different types of cakes

175
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,150
 Now at the level of the tools that we can use, I am not going to delve into

176
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,689
 a lot in our own reality of tools there is a lot of truth

177
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,070
 we can spend hours talking about various tools to make different types

178
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,340
 of things what I do want to tell you is that in reality there is no tool

179
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,360
 to do us everything we need if it depends a lot on which one is ours

180
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,890
 objective we want to achieve and we always have to evaluate the tools by

181
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,800
 example here on the screen we are seeing two tools that I personally

182
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,030
 I have used to do social engineering attacks specifically

183
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,040
 deficit led on the one hand we have a tool called kingfisher that

184
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,000
 it serves to make difficult campaigns, the attractiveness of it inflicts is that I

185
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,490
 It allows me to graph my campaigns and be able to make a [ __ ] of it

186
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,120
 Detect behavior rather of the interaction that have the

187
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,050
 users with the emails if I can bring statistics of how many

188
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,589
 users received the email how many users opened the email with your

189
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,550
 users clicked on the link true and other data such as

190
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,609
 geolocation then for massive corporate campaigns is very interesting

191
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,700
 very useful something important that it inflicts is the tool that manages me because

192
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,080
 all the sending of the campaigns all the configuration of the campaigns but the

193
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,300
 shipping as such is something independent of the platform I mean to be able to

194
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,400
 configure for example a mailing service an smtp or an open riley

195
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,660
 etc. that the tool does not do it by itself I have to configure

196
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,230
 this information and give it to the tools then that is something very

197
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,040
 important because then we have to do a proper configuration of

198
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,750
 our mail delivery service for later use in fisher

199
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,580
 which are little details that at the end of the day we have to know how to do many

200
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,270
 many tests is something very important there as data

201
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,790
 interesting I tell you that for each of the difficult attacks that I have

202
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,329
 made to give you an idea I have made a

203
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:11,890
 I do an average of 60 to 70 tests before I send the mail that is going to

204
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,240
 serve as an attack on my victims because because I only have one chance

205
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,580
 and that opportunity let's say I'm wrong and I do something wrong

206
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,720
 I probably will no longer have a second chance to attack front if he has

207
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,040
 to be perfect on the other hand we have a tool called zeta fisher

208
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,540
 and well of course the Saudi show on youtube which is the favorite tool

209
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,240
 of all the liniers I am already coming in cali linux and the whole question but

210
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,040
 because I put them here in contrast to what it means to actually do it

211
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,790
 because it is this fisher and social on youtube that with much more tools

212
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,230
 inclusive yes but for example bring your benefits by

213
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,950
 example is tradition brings a lot of predefined templates for gift show

214
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:03,230
 for forgiveness for playstation twitter facebook etc. in chips that still

215
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,449
 much as much shorter in this part yes but it is fiction for example no

216
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,949
 allows me to be able to graph my campaign and to be able to do this kings of a lot of

217
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,069
 email accounts simultaneously then if the objectives are realized

218
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,419
 are different you are light is more intrusive more like for an attack on a

219
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,380
 person but what to inflict serves me more like sending 500 emails

220
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,090
 electronic messages and to be able to generate a report of that was to enter the client texts like this

221
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,389
 realize they are different tools with different goals and

222
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,830
 again there is not one that nothing everything I have to somehow do the

223
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,189
 tunnel now well I want to tell you a little

224
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,789
 exercise a real example a real case of a social engineering attack on a

225
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:54,510
 organization that hired me to evaluate its users not then this

226
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,240
 organization was a financial institution where they requested you can do

227
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,740
 a targeted phishing campaign while also making calls

228
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,820
 What I want to tell you next is how the attack on

229
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,928
 phising directed then as the first point because the most important thing for them

230
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:19,260
 and seven elites thought this was a financial organization then within

231
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:25,230
 of its services that it provided because it was the subject of vehicle insurance

232
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:31,830
 and for other things then I decided to interact with this organization as

233
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:37,428
 a normal client through compact now my intention was that

234
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,480
 someone from the company will contact me back by then I can

235
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,950
 identify emails the name of a collaborator or

236
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,360
 contributor to email signatures etc. and who believes that

237
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,908
 it actually worked because I was wanting to request information about a

238
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:59,179
 safe and good the commercial area contacted me immediately because

239
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,900
 obviously they wanted to sell you one of these services, no then that's good dear

240
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,720
 Mr. Pedrito only use profiles

241
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:13,010
 false truth we enclose the price of your vehicle blah blah blah and well I already

242
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,520
 I had all this information that I tell you, no name etc. that I already had in look

243
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,929
 and feel to be able to use below I needed to find a

244
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:26,480
 profile to be able to impersonate because I decided almost always true we do something

245
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,789
 What is it like to use someone's profile within the same company because

246
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:36,320
 We could use, for example, the profile of a supplier of our client, yes

247
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,600
 but we are not really allowed to use this image where you are

248
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,110
 a two-edged sword when we do this type of service obviously from

249
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,799
 confidentiality agreements and all these kinds of issues then it is very

250
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,330
 delicate for example to impersonate the identity of a technician of a technician

251
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:59,269
 which is very functional true but to keep in a much more schematic

252
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:02,480
 controllable attack many times we decided to use the

253
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,470
 profile of someone within the organization then in my case I

254
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,049
 it works very good in this specific case it worked for me

255
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:14,168
 the link I really found a lot of information from the collaborators

256
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,899
 particularly a profile that caught my attention, which was the manager

257
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:23,899
 of human resources besides this I managed to find some

258
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,710
 news in digital media of this organization and I realized that

259
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,820
 recently this organization had been the recipient of the award at the

260
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,889
 international then within the notes as the high command had good

261
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,030
 no the board was building the prize etcetera and he called me the

262
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,670
 Attention that in all the photos was the human resources manager

263
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,740
 so this made me think that he is indeed a person of a lot of

264
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,850
 a lot of importance within the organization so I thought good if

265
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,050
 This person will send an email to all collaborators, sure the

266
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,290
 collaborators pay attention to him because I understand that he is someone

267
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,909
 importance then derived from that of the note that

268
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,220
 I found about the award decided to use the following pretext was to give

269
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,140
 continuity to this award and therefore in some way or some kind of benefit

270
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,990
 to the collaborators and the benefit was to offer them scholarships because

271
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,100
 higher and range from scholarships of 50 60 70 to a

272
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,300
 95% of financial support which was something that is quite juicy and this at the level of

273
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,980
 master's degrees and even doctorates so I said good the cem in

274
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,519
 that moment was for anyone, it may interest you, no

275
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:45,200
 Well, who better to send that message than the manager of human remains

276
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,059
 you will then basically see the email that it will send a bit like what

277
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:55,399
 that we see on the screen this is an example merely for reference the issue is that

278
00:21:55,399 --> 00:22:00,738
 an email body was known that invited collaborators to do

279
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:07,669
 make your application to be a beneficiary of the bee then inside

280
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,389
 of the same osh phase and also discover what technology was used

281
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,570
 this company specifically for email is used as

282
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,678
 office what I did was use a very old technique but still

283
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,479
 Today's functional was that it is the chubby malicious redirect

284
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:27,889
 and then they realize that I placed a vehicle that made reference to

285
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:32,729
 office.com yes but actually this was leading to a

286
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,300
 site that was under my control a server that was under my control

287
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,169
 then people clicked on the vehicle and clicking on the link

288
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:44,880
 that they will be directed to a false page of office 365 they will see I had to

289
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,650
 obviously find out what the url was because there are many companies that for

290
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,920
 example use an image that custom

291
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,580
 on his blog in the office 365 then if this had been the case and he had

292
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,230
 had to replace the image etc. but in this case it was an image

293
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,460
 default of the office 3 of 5 something important and I will explain why

294
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,830
 What about this if you realize that here is something that is very evident that many of

295
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:16,649
 you will know that if this is that way then that is a phishing if they occur

296
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,710
 account I am not using well I do not know if you can see but here I am

297
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,750
 marking at the top of the navigation bar there is no domain

298
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,290
 truth I was a bit cheeky they need this attack and they use the

299
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,980
 public ip address actually i did it because

300
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,450
 as part of the controlled exercise I am very interested in later

301
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,540
 demonstrate to users how they could tell or identify that this was a

302
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,580
 attack because if I do the attack in a perfect way like me then they

303
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,960
 I'm going to say look, you have to realize that he is a physicist, but if we do something

304
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,669
 as evident as this they imply and they will if it is true what I

305
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,809
 has been saying the cis or all this time he is right because it turns out that

306
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,970
 divine America and they are physical and I fell into the trap then well we did not have a

307
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:12,320
 domain we did not have a certificate etc these types of errors are made to

308
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,309
 purpose so that later within the report that we make in our time

309
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,379
 so you can take this information and take advantage of it in your campaigns

310
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,279
 sensitization then in this false page because it

311
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,870
 What it does is steal credentials if at this time the user enters

312
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,428
 your username and password with us we do not leave the credentials and we are not happy

313
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:42,470
 with that we made another redirect to

314
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,360
 a good office365 form because the company used office 365 and in

315
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,310
 this form of office 365 what we are doing is asking for more

316
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,100
 information name identity number date of birth cell phone number

317
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,449
 et cetera et cetera et cetera then and be mindful we were saying a robbery

318
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,520
 quite important of sensitive information not only the password of the

319
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,420
 email they think worked the attack doesn't work

320
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,500
 these are the real statistics of this attack below I will

321
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,810
 explain as the first point we have on the side

322
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:28,409
 right with light blue color 29 percent look at this this are the emails

323
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,140
 emails from users who took absolutely no action

324
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,230
 it can cause that they did not see the mail it can cause that the mail did not reach them or

325
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,700
 that the mail suddenly sofas for me we do not know but the truth is that it did not happen

326
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,830
 absolutely nothing then 13 percent of users opened the mail

327
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,850
 electronic this is not bad but as I tell you our tool must

328
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,560
 be able to collect all user behavior through

329
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,290
 then things are starting to get a little ugly

330
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:04,600
 21 percent of users clicked on the link and because this is a sign

331
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,490
 Good alert is a red flag because there are some attacks where

332
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,900
 users are only required to click on the link and in this way

333
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,700
 as the attackers manage to take control of the computer or the browser or

334
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,570
 ask other types of questions then this is no longer recommended

335
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,550
 then we have 11 percent of users who gave us their credentials

336
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,260
 access and incidentally are credentials that we validate for

337
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,090
 because we have come across victims many times that what they do is that they

338
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,929
 account of the phishing attack and they begin to swear

339
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:47,450
 in the password then if we do a validation of this

340
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:53,020
 and 26% of users, after doing the whole exercise, clicked on the link

341
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,400
 enter your credentials and

342
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,230
 gave us the information we were requesting is to formulate in three

343
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:09,900
 basically we can define or conclude the 37% of the users who were

344
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,270
 an important piece of information was violated, several of these victims belonged to the

345
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,730
 technology area and one of them particularly your email user

346
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,620
 electronic that automatically the domain user was domain

347
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:31,629
 you know what this means was then we basically managed to hack josh

348
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,140
 so we get very happy now when we did this then

349
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:41,280
 basically this was what we did using the methodology that I am telling you

350
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,160
 true and well it works now well this was an example from the perspective of

351
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,320
 a controlled genetic attack on hacking no and now I want to give you another

352
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,700
 perspective now we are going to see a real case also of attacks by

353
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,380
 social engineering but where I had the opportunity to participate not like the

354
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,530
 executor of the attack but it was a real attack that had worked because

355
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,780
 if a malicious actor and my participation there was from a forensic perspective yes

356
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,899
 It is an attack that happened that I had the opportunity to arrive and my task was

357
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,200
 investigate investigate and find digital evidence of what it was that

358
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,510
 It had happened then to this case and I call him catch me if you can, his case is

359
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,940
 third baseman camps I am going to tell you basically what it is about

360
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,800
 this happened in a huge multinational company true and I like

361
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,510
 a lot to tell this because it is actually the pub can happen anyone will see

362
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,470
 this we have seen many small and medium companies of hitch companies

363
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,390
 also and this tendency to do this type of attack has come a lot

364
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,350
 growth now we are going to know what this multinational company is about

365
00:28:53,350 --> 00:29:01,120
 has two companies under its multi-company umbrella, it turns out that within each

366
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,149
 one of those companies there are two users gloria and jose to put their name on

367
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:11,689
 the one that these two users interact every day easily exchange

368
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,630
 those of more than 200 emails and with paid topics, that is, josé le

369
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,880
 asks Gloria every day to make payments to him for the number of suppliers in

370
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,559
 any country is if you are basically the interaction of them what was what

371
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,840
 One glorious day happened well and he realizes from one of Jose's emails that he was a

372
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,559
 little strange for a particular data that came

373
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:43,399
 altered and it was the swift code of a glory bank it seemed strange to him this was

374
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:48,768
 about jose, he says, jose, look at this, this email, what's up with this, jose says

375
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:53,090
 Look, I never sent it, he's going to check his outbox, he can't find it.

376
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,750
 then they report it to their superiors the superiors report it at all

377
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,889
 technology has been a kind of review and they realize that email from

378
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:06,678
 Glory because I had been violated then at that moment they call me true

379
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,360
 and well basically the response to the incident

380
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,419
 basically it is doing a rough forensic analysis which is what I did

381
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:21,950
 in the first instance 3 hijack the devices of the two users

382
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,540
 involved but had a base story but actually at the time

383
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,580
 for me seeing it dispassionately these two people can be victims or

384
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,220
 can be part of the attackers yes then until it is not proven

385
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:44,960
 The opposite is that they are suspicious and well, basically, I had multiple sources of

386
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,890
 information this company used full microsoft technologies but had a

387
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:53,000
 kind of hybrid between local technologies and cloud technologies by

388
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,559
 mention some sources of information we had office365 we had

389
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,899
 microsoft exchange we had of course the domain controller unasur

390
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:08,000
 domains themselves were also subject to review because all this that had been

391
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
 given again the legitimate addresses of the

392
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,479
 users and of course the firewall blogs as well and basically good

393
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,129
 having this kind of information turns into looking for a needle in a

394
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:26,620
 haystack really something important when it occurs in this type of situation

395
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,100
 Normally those of us who are involved in the analysis are therefore the ones who

396
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,439
 we have the fun part because we love to do this but very tired

397
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,860
 also because we usually have very little time to be able to do these

398
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,090
 reviews we do not have weeks or months to be able to do something like the

399
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,649
 books we really have a couple of days and we must find what happened and

400
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:52,580
 well then I'm going to tell you a little more or less how the

401
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,649
 good thing I'm not from now and forgive there for the luxuries all with the diagram

402
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:02,418
 a bit basic but I will try to exemplify what happened then by

403
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:04,780
 this side we have glory who was the girl in charge

404
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,609
 to make the payments we have Jose who was the person who

405
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:14,829
 daily because he interacts with glory to be able to ask him to make the payments

406
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:19,329
 and on this right side as we have the way of example because the domains of

407
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:24,279
 the two companies that were involved site 1 dot com and 52

408
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:28,690
 dotcom knowing that glory because it belongs to a company said it

409
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,740
 belongs to another company both within the same corporation

410
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,110
 then 15 days through the incident it turns out that Gloria received an email

411
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:45,820
 electronic is malicious impersonated but neither boxing laws that came from a third

412
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,800
 person that for the purposes of the case we are going to put xyz steals site two

413
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,780
 contact points and Gloria could not be able to cite that it was an email from

414
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,970
 fishing and was apparently a contributor

415
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:06,799
 of the same corporation and that this site is deceived because they believe

416
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,779
 invited to go to microsoft one drive yes glory falls into deception at that time

417
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:18,399
 authenticates on the platform and from this moment on, your account is

418
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,080
 The attacker has been compromised because he manages to capture the credentials but something happens

419
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,399
 very interesting and it is that this happened fifteen days after the incident as they

420
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:32,678
 I comment and the attacker from having compromised the glory account does not

421
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,539
 take absolutely no malicious action but instead start to

422
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:42,009
 Know what Gloria's behavior is and with whom Gloria interacts

423
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:47,679
 in the day-to-day so that is where the attacker realizes that he is Jose

424
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,340
 who on a daily basis will send glory many requests to make payments to

425
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,428
 banks then this drew a lot of attention from the vacancies

426
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:04,659
 the attacker was doing this for 15 days learning the behavior of

427
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:09,760
 glory then the 15th day arrives which is when the incident happens and in

428
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,629
 that moment of the attacker because he already begins to act and what he does in the first

429
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:18,399
 instance is that you create email rules within the account of

430
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,949
 glory that what they do is divert all or rather forward all

431
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:29,399
 e-mails you receive away from e to a folder that the attacker created to

432
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,460
 this objective the attacker's intention is that and not

433
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,168
 receive your inbox inbox the emails of jose then during that day

434
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,739
 or those hours of that day all the emails that josé sent him

435
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:47,138
 because his glory had no visibility of being able to visualize them during that time

436
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,339
 it turns out that josé sent him an email let's say legitimate glory really that

437
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,090
 particularly draws the attention of the attacker

438
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,770
 in this mail derived from the rule as it will be stored in the folder that the

439
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,440
 attacker had created but the attacker does something next and it is that he copies

440
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,940
 all the body of the message all the look and feel of jose's email already

441
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,590
 then it impersonates josete's email account

442
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:19,600
 an email spoofing remember I know that the attacker does not have access to the account

443
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,600
 Jose only has access to Gloria's account

444
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,150
 So what happened to the attacker? I identify a bad practice in

445
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:34,660
 the domains of both companies basically so as not to get into very

446
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,308
 technicians were not properly configured what is called as

447
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:44,799
 sfdk ymy jean-marc in this way the attacker could make the email and drain

448
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:50,920
 of both email accounts then the attacker then creates

449
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,499
 a fake or spoofed email from Jose and obviously as an attacker he has access to

450
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:00,660
 Gloria's account if he manages to make this fake email fall

451
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,609
 find in glory inbox

452
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:07,808
 then glories receives this malicious email and then is when

453
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:11,200
 Gloria realizes the account number that came in has changed because the attacker

454
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,689
 direct and lazy did a copy-paste Jose's email is true but changed the

455
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,440
 swift code account from banks the intention was that I

456
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,970
 made the payment glory finally did not make the payment because he realized at the time

457
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:29,769
 but that they are on time, it is relative because in reality, although

458
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:34,589
 Gloria noticed the fraudulent email was not able to

459
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:39,029
 the first mail to become the front door attack vector

460
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:44,400
 main of the attacker and basically the attacker had already been fifteen days

461
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,680
 within the email account of my glory because they compromised

462
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,910
 We were able to identify the last trace of the attacker's IP address

463
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,140
 this came from jamaica i guess the attacker very calm

464
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,529
 Well, I was enjoying the benefits that mister robert left us

465
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,770
 nesta marley no but hey we all know that ip addresses are easily

466
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,509
 manipulable without leaving we can miss the then at the end of the day our

467
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,740
 work before the client ended in the opposite trace the digital evidence

468
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,529
 can demonstrate how this attack had been possible and also by another

469
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,859
 side because we are a company that also try to provide solutions

470
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:30,569
 so we made a series of recommendations there because there were many

471
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:36,058
 bad practices that we could visualize the truth for example the theme of the one here

472
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:41,089
 ym not having a double authentication factor that would have been prevented

473
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:46,319
 enormously that type of attack does not have certain certain configurations that

474
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:51,210
 allow to save logs etc this is the theme was also to give it true

475
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:57,319
 value to the exercise that the company can take actions

476
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,900
 Now I want to tell you a little bit about the other perspective, more of everything

477
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,590
 the social engineering issue we already saw a controlled attack we already saw an attack

478
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:11,480
 real from a forensic perspective now we are going to the also fun part that

479
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,430
 are the capture the flag true rehearsing in ginger capture free that

480
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:23,990
 He was born from echo 15 last year, I really had the opportunity to be a participant

481
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:29,209
 of this agent efe and of course of the echo that is to say to point a little in what

482
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,680
 This consisted for all those who could not be present to see there for

483
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,430
 who could do it because remember a little how it was this

484
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,930
 activity then and to give them a little context

485
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,069
 capture the most popular social engineering flash ever made

486
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,060
 traditionally in the United States specifically the disk of the hand of

487
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:55,269
 Christ 'forge the Lord that I showed them at the beginning

488
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:59,008
 but in reality in Latin America the first time is like this something like this

489
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:04,179
 will process by its precedents because it was a Spanish language not then it called

490
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:09,849
 much attention and what was the mechanics of capturing the true flag before the

491
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:16,029
 face-to-face eco party event because those of us who wanted to participate had to

492
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:21,729
 propose to, let's say, the jury to the organizers three victims of the three

493
00:39:21,729 --> 00:39:27,189
 companies that we would like to be able to attack from these three companies the

494
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:32,049
 organizers and they will select only one company and confirm us

495
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:36,189
 Well, with what company were we finally going to participate from those

496
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:39,969
 with figures of forgiveness that with confirmation we had two days to

497
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:44,979
 be able to perform the opel smart solos phase and produce a report that

498
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:48,308
 it was going to be evaluated by the organizers based on that there will be a

499
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:51,770
 sort of qualifying to the final like this

500
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,810
 say what they expect already during the activity of the deco part and

501
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,560
 eventually the classifieds are selected and well one day the event in

502
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,360
 the eco we had the opportunity for eight people to participate in the phase

503
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,480
 final and what was the final phase well this is to share day 1 the

504
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,560
 day 1 as it was totally distinguishable social but what we see on the screen of

505
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,850
 left side is a phone booth that is literally on stage

506
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:25,400
 then the final phase of the capture the flag was external inside the cabin

507
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,620
 telephone to the entire audience that was of more than 2,000 people and begin to

508
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,400
 make phone calls in order to extract information from

509
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,500
 our victims this is a little bit what it looks like in a few minutes before giving

510
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:46,280
 I start to capture flash and here I am, view of Guatemala, Uruguay and

511
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,660
 well the rest were Argentines so the other photo that we see on the screen is

512
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,850
 a photograph seen from behind the stage minutes before starting

513
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,770
 manages to have put the auditorium that is filling no then they ask me

514
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,870
 total adrenaline in these types of activities we were all super super

515
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,680
 super accelerated we had 20 minutes to power is each one to be able

516
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,080
 making calls anyway the blood ran through our veins

517
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,000
 Now, how was my participation in the CTF? Well, the three victims that I

518
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,940
 I proposed that something interesting is that within the bases it was not

519
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:31,650
 forced to choose only Argentine companies, he could already choose companies from

520
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,790
 my country or another country in my case then I decided to propose to the

521
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:43,500
 my country's social security institute not as a second option and I chose one

522
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,280
 multinational food and beverage company that is classified as the largest

523
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,820
 the largest in the world based in Switzerland and at the headquarters of the

524
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,220
 South America is in Argentina and as a third point because I chose a

525
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:05,509
 private energy supplier company in Argentina and well this almost less

526
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,520
 in less than two minutes he answered me and the organizers answered me and

527
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:17,210
 they chose the second option which was the multinational corporation is not said

528
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:21,560
 incidentally, I chose it because it caught my attention to be able to choose a company that

529
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:27,500
 will imply a fairly high challenge and I for this one at this point because I had already

530
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,720
 done some some ethics phone call testing

531
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,250
 the matter I thought you could opt for something more rigorous more difficult

532
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,730
 etc

533
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,780
 The flashes that we see on the screen were the ones that provided us with the

534
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:53,569
 you ask basically the flags so we had a defined universe

535
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:59,029
 of questions we could not ask what we wanted was something quite good

536
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:04,490
 controlled and as you can see because the questions are grouped more or less

537
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,709
 by type we do not have questions at the logistics level we have products levels of

538
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:16,040
 technology about the company technology used in the company question

539
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,230
 about the employee and of course because each question has a value if the

540
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,010
 questions that were more complex than steel more complex than getting a

541
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,640
 answer in which it had the most value not because they were the most attractive by

542
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,089
 For example, the one that has the most value here 5 points was a question where the

543
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:40,790
 phrase actually where we had to make the person we are with

544
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:47,779
 talking on the phone and type a url and you will visit it then from this url

545
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,690
 Well, what the pilots did was nothing more

546
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,980
 detect the true visit to confirm that this was the person who had visited

547
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,990
 correctly the site and had visited the site but imagine how complex

548
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:05,779
 which is to dictate to someone who is probably not technical a url and

549
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,550
 that on top of it give him enter and that on top of the constitution this not then that era of

550
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:13,180
 the most complicated

551
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,950
 we were not obliged to ask all the truth questions but

552
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:24,089
 we had to be able to choose those that according to how

553
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:27,720
 if it were giving the conversation with our victim then we could choose

554
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,009
 ask him for example at the level of technologies, there were questions since

555
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,930
 the operating system used up to which specific version of web browser you are

556
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,819
 using things like that

557
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:47,940
 also on the other hand there were rules that things that we were not allowed to

558
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,630
 do for example we could not use topics related to sexual matters

559
00:44:54,630 --> 00:45:00,119
 For example, we could not impersonate a high command and force

560
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,530
 people to clean information under threat of destination for example

561
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:09,900
 It is totally prohibited and we could not ask passwords either.

562
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,920
 charge that was totally

563
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:19,060
 prohibited then if there were a series of rules something important was also that

564
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,790
 this this art was organized

565
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:29,190
 and in some way supported or endorsed by various experts not only on issues of

566
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:34,770
 social engineering and psychology but also lawyers and crime experts

567
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:40,050
 cybernetic truths and they were the ones who were there also seeing that the

568
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:44,220
 live calls at some point that they saw that it was something that was out of

569
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,069
 control of these suggestive end calls calls were in

570
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:55,300
 reality in real attacks and for this reason it was not allowed

571
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,740
 record video, photos or audio while actually running them

572
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,609
 we are attacking real companies that had not been notified

573
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:07,990
 on the matter now then it is something quite delicate but well thanks to the

574
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:13,370
 good organization of the eco was something very very controlled

575
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:18,049
 well and how was the execution of my participation in my engineering attack

576
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:22,370
 social to start the work to make the call will be from 5 in the

577
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:27,109
 later this was not a coincidence it was not randomly selected because they believe it was

578
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:32,720
 I did this way simply because when we gave 5 the

579
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,810
 late departure time that what we want to do is leave immediately

580
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:40,549
 go home to rest then when we are emotionally affected

581
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,960
 our brain does not reason and that is the ideal time for an attacker to

582
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,450
 approach us and get us to get information in my particular case I my

583
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:54,439
 participation was around six in the afternoon then social - now it does

584
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,420
 the calls for my bad luck all the phone numbers that I got from

585
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,260
 the company did not work any something important was that during the phase of or

586
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,640
 If we were not authorized to advance the attacks, that is to say no

587
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,299
 we could call we could not interact with the victim of any

588
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,200
 way the actual interaction had to be during the event for it to have

589
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,160
 weight and sense then all the numbers

590
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,940
 phone numbers that I got none worked for me I only had a service to the

591
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:30,349
 customer 1 800 available and well I called I answered someone from service to

592
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:36,050
 client I decided to use the pretext may be a person from the area of

593
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:40,220
 audit and compliance who for audit and compliance reasons

594
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,540
 I needed to collect a series of information that I needed in that

595
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:48,410
 moment then i started collecting some flashes really just just

596
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:53,960
 I managed to get two the chs of the mark the computer dies or the computer and the

597
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,599
 person who attended me after the third question tells me look, I'm not here

598
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,990
 authorize that this information I will ask you to contact our

599
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:07,669
 security officer his name is x10 eta he can attend

600
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:11,599
 for any requirement I have then I was like wow this ever

601
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,600
 it had happened to me before I had never seen an awareness program

602
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:23,839
 so efficient that it will make the person reason and think about who was

603
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,040
 calling because I was seeing that and to follow the established protocol that

604
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,240
 was to report the incident to your security officer. I don't know if you had

605
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,229
 seen this before but in all the phone calls and attacks of

606
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,830
 social engineering that I have done at least in my country never of ever

607
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:44,750
 I had seen something like that then something very surprising for me very well for this

608
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:51,530
 company bad for me but excellent the experience not my time had not been

609
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,700
 I finished my phone calls that I kept I kept going and I managed to talk to

610
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,560
 a couple more people but that couple of people three told me that as

611
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,270
 his previous partner had told me they could not give me information and that the

612
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:09,920
 incident had already been reported so basically this is a case not

613
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,550
 so successful true but hey you don't always win so this is basically the

614
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,430
 last what scenario that I wanted to comment on

615
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:26,609
 so that we could take that part of eb in a controlled attack and a

616
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:34,900
 forensic investigation and well a ctf then tips that I give you maybe for

617
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,740
 to close the talk or things that he was learning along the way that

618
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,879
 Obviously, many books and tutorials say it too.

619
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,900
 there and the most important thing is that when we do a social engineering attack

620
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,900
 let's say under an ethics scheme here it is extremely important that we have

621
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,820
 fully defined and in writing the scope and objective of the activity yes

622
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,400
 why not dt because we should know that it is

623
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,030
 allow it is not allowed to do for example a physical instruction by

624
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,900
 example that is something that we do not talk about today but there are also that type

625
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:15,700
 of activities physically enter a physical facility if we are able to

626
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,390
 do that, what are we going to do with me inside?

627
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,740
 I can for example steal a computer but that is allowed

628
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:29,709
 within the scope of the activity if I am going to want to try to enter the center

629
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,460
 data for example but that is allowed within scope then

630
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:38,250
 when we are hired to do some of this, let's define the scope well

631
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:42,609
 usually clients will not know much about what they want too, but

632
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:45,940
 they say I think they do what almost everything but good if they do not know

633
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,720
 we have to try to explain how far it is going to go

634
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,980
 our service of our activity to

635
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:58,650
 unfortunate things happen the other big ticket I give you is that the project

636
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:04,710
 must be sponsored by senior management who is not necessarily part

637
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:09,000
 from the security technology area true a general manager a manager

638
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,920
 financial and from the hand of the ciso who hires us to do this because both

639
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,670
 They have to sign a document where they authorize us to do that type of

640
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:21,320
 evidence in case the police catch us inside what we have collapsed

641
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,070
 then these are a little bit of tips that

642
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:29,330
 I give a lot of trial and error a lot try error this requires a lot

643
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:34,400
 practice and well with that we are finishing my name is amílcar de lyon

644
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,290
 again there are my social networks I invite you to visit the page

645
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:44,690
 from facebook of the secret there we usually publish some news from

646
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:48,470
 security and well if there is still a little time out there there are consultations

647
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:54,230
 we can gladly address them then thank you for your time and I am

648
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:59,440
 here to listen to any queries you may have
