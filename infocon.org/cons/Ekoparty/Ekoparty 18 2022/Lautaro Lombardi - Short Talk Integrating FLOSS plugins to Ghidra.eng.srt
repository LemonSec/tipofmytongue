We welcome Lautaro Lombardi with a round of applause [Applause] Hello, how are you? Let's start with this presentation that I have titled Integrating free plans to guidra through the compatibility layers guide. From now on, to start with, my name is Lautaro Lombardi.  As you have just heard and I am a thesis student for a degree in computing from the National University of Córdoba I am doing an internship at eclipseum in which this project arises and I am studying at the Faculty of mathematics astronomy physics and computing and well if you have already noticed  my all nothing if I'm from Cordoba the slides will be on my github that they develop for the anxious and those who want to see links and others will be published there so well without going any further we start with the official one then a bit of the agenda that  we are going to be seeing we are going to see the motivation objectives and restrictions of Electricity we are going to see the architecture and the a  main file that is in charge of executing the logistics then some examples that I brought with a bit of code for us to review and finally they produce against future work and a bit of kion there if we arrive we have time left we can run something live too then from the motivation  Of the decisions I will mention that there are more than 100 free plugins in Aída alone and more than 100 free plans on tour in Enya and other platforms and in fact there have been similar projects whose objective was to integrate compatibility in two directions, for example  like daenerys between between between Aída and guidra but in both directions let's say want to do a little more ambitious than Jesse he intends and it's vanilla for example we have a plugin that is responsible for integrating The compayiler of the pillar of Gibraltar intro also then they exist  and projects whose objective is to catalyze interoperability between platforms. So I would tell you how to give them  company the objective is to allow plugins to run extensions of different reverse engineering platforms that are not from guidra to guidra so to do that the idea the restrictions not to alter the source code of the plugin and the procedure to use it is to add the plugin directory to  guidra and in that directory add part of the dcl and then run the plugin but it runs as a Script, that is, we are going to lose the plugin guidelines but we remain focused on the functionality of the plugin so well that is what we are going to try to do  Something I wanted to mention is that, for example, in screenshot number 2 we have the original plugin, the file that is boxed, and all the rest of the files are part of the dcl, so all the different Pay points from simswelve are part of the Gisela. So it's like a  entire framework whose objective is to be able to run without sulf on tour and any other plugin in general also then the architecture  The reading of the essentially Tomás any plugin in particular the ones that I am going to show are one way but any plugin in general tells them the expose and the app of Aida al Play So the plugin looks and interacts with that bpa and I told them he is in charge of Translating  and send guidra so that you want it to be in charge of executing each of those interactions and here a new component enters the equation that is paijaira and this is going to be a hydra plugin that will allow us to run Tyson 3 in guidra for those who  have used vibrants wants to allow python to run through Jackson which makes a binding between payson and Java but Jason's support is quite limited allows us to run up to Tyson 2.7 which is why the community began to find other alternatives to allow more current Tyson to be run  in guidra and one of those alternatives is paihaira So from paijaira we are going to launch guidra true and it will allow us to run python 3 in guidra is is the en  gine that allows us to run through Jake Pipe python 3 in guidra then paijaira launches guidra we run python 3 from the yeca the gcl instantiates an object of the plugin class and we are going to search in particular for the entry point of the plugin to be launched  from the tcl So all the plugins and in general all the platforms Have a Dedicated Entry Point for it to start running and its functionality from the moment one calls the entry Point of the plugin the rest is a Loop that goes from the plugin to guide and  from gibral plugin and in the middle gsl doing the translations of the Apps of each software and here the main file that Due to lack of creativity is called Main which basically has two functions I want to emphasize them in main the last line if you look closely  It is a slow call and Point of the plugin and that is all we want to do, calls in tripoint the rest of the lines are simply from 12 to 16 making a manual import can be done  You can do an import default in python if you can do it but there was a restriction in one of the examples that I am going to show you that made me make it a bit more generic and do a manual import of the plugin source code then through this  annual report we can call the entry point of the plugin without problems and then one of the Valentine's functions the other function is line number 11 which is to export the carven program object that for those who have used guidra or for those who have not used them fit programs  visible only to file Yes and then it goes out of scope of the rest of the hierarchies so to keep it we had to either pass it as an argument but the plan in the Source code of the plan and it doesn't wait for the carrer program doesn't know who the car is in program So we had to  find a way to bypass the source code and that way was this which is as simple as having a module to which this file only writes and the rest of the module  those of the Gisel read then Sipi is a module of the lacial guide whose only objective is to store the car in the program and all the rest of the modules will read the car in the program and take data from the addresses of the program base and  from the number of functions etcetera etcetera and we arrived at the first example that I was able to run in guidra this is an Aida plugin whose only function is to be able to search and to the rules in guidra the objective So it is through yarapaison note that this yarapyson is not a  module that is supported by guidra so there is a pro of using Pathfinder that allows us to use new modules that are not included by default in guidra and and to be able to add functionalities in fact until we can import Nampa and in guidra and do very crazy things But  well faincript is going to look for rules and now what for those who don't know what a rule is and now it's just some kind of reggaex on steroids as I said  my mentor has a bit of metadata But the idea is to look for that String in a program So I made a little program whose sole objective is to trigger that rule and now then you see it in C, it's a little arrangement that has the rule and now that I want to trigger  and well I compile the binary I add it in guidra and run fahrencript so before showing you the execution I show you some of the procedures that had to be done in guidra for example we have these imports that the plugin has, we have to define them as part of the electricity then  one has to define etcetera etcetera to make Walking of classes For example the Aida Shoes is something that does not interest us it is simply an Aida class that we need to mock to allow the plugin to run and finally the entry Pointe in the last two lines of the  plugin there is an entry Point which, as you can see, is just two lines and it is Call an object of the plugin class And that is what h  There was Main punto país in its last line, you also remember that it said electrical module and well, this is Call this place in the plugin And then the rest is to allow the Source code to run as well and here I put a screenshot in case we do not arrive with the  time this what it does is raise paijaira except that it is the guinea pig the Guy from hydra gives you all the rest are logs that Pay hydra prints until he raises the Wii from guidra all that info info is payjadera raising then the console remains on standby and  the rest is fainscript running there that says is that I give them some region of memory that could not obtain information then they see that it runs Search for rules now that is already the plugin running itself and finally it prints that it found this one and the rul that they  I showed previously and and the match was correct no so some of the translations this is the source code in green Source code of the plugin in orange the translation that I have to do this code  Neither more nor less than they look for the memory segments so one has to define the module I have gone to YouTube import CP as I told you before that I had the car in the program and Search inside the car in the program for the memory segments and return them to a guidra not with  the one with the type that has gone would also handle if you look for example there is a subtraction not in less late well those are integers they are not numbers so there it turns by default it returns you it returns you aggression and the type you open Does not support Does not support  subtraction then one has to transform integers and that is why this call is there I want it etc. this is a bit of pseudocode here it is not exactly the same as the decisions but in the idea is this is one more translation we can see them later we go to another plugin  Sims Wolf there is this plugin what it does is export the names of functions from a binary it also has the same logic it does not bring modules we have the modules there are A  BC, all of this must be defined and brought, those are already part of the and are the essentials that one would have to support to allow the plugin to run correctly, here I also put another capture of payjaira and something that this plugin had that caught my attention is that  there was a commented line that if one uncommented the rear plugin then what I did was to PR the plugin So if you are going to see it there is still the PR to solve that error and the Crash that it has is that it is simply called traceback without ever  having imported it before then there is a double Craft first because that line that is always commented out due to a type problem that is seen when it was ported to python 3 eh I don't know it was not taken into account and when it shuts down it is an exception this other one jumps  Except for the fact that tracer is not imported, so I also made a PR to solve this small problem, but the idea is simple if the plugin is fixed here and it runs as a  Script is not there I am passing the name of the binary in as the first argument I tell it Okay run This program and as the second argument I tell it from the main.pay in the main.pay obviously you have to put the name of the plugin that is going to be  Sims and a manual import of that file is going to be done and then Call the Sims entry point and Sims prints this vlog that you can see on the screen and saves the result in a country that you specify. All this also has to be done with translations  no the search for pads has to be compatible with the hydra packs as well so some translations Also here what I find interesting are several questions first note that the source code of the plugin in green on the left Search for segments that have that do not have the name  external or plt now when you go to guidra the external segment is called external so one has to be careful that when you go to translate external it returns external as  name to make a correct match between the names of the segments that the plan expects. So, as you can see in orange, if I found an external segment called external and return it like this. You just have to be careful in the jessical to maintain compatibilities between the different nomenclatures that each  one of the of the of the of the of the of the reverse engineering platforms contemplate not and another thing another issue with the same source code fix last we have these fansstar and Funk size and that is not part of the way that hydra functions works  so what I had to do is make non-function rappers so that they have that shape and the plugin can find these these these these members in a Funk class not in a function class So I use this get Funk rapper see what it says  fan rapper down there Well I rap what is called hydra function And also I add these members Start ea is effective art  address and the size of the function So it's like I have to give methods to a class that does not exist in guidra but that the plugin needs to see in order to run as is the Source code And finally WiFi and Riverside in tool  which is a planning that is in It is in the oven But this plugin is going to come out soon what is good about it And it is the one that leads us to do the manual import in guidra It is that this plugin has many, many modules below the definition of Google  definition of a bunch of offsets that manages WiFi then all that is if they are set as part of a directory called WiFi analyzer and at the same hierarchical level is the plugin that is called in the same way uefin alizer then to be able to run an amount  I'm going to say analyzer, the way it had to be done is to do that manual amount so nothing I put a screenshot lifting paijaira lifting stone from paijaira showing that the plugin is running  It's running, the only thing I need to finish doing is provide the WiFi structures to be able to make notes, but well, the plan is up and the good thing about this plugin is that it allows us to show that there is possible scalability in this project that we are not only going to  dealing with standard source code from a single file but also in larger frameworks it is also possible to achieve compatibility between both softwares so some translations that we can see later due to lack of time we are going to see Frozen no eh speed  development The good thing about this is that each plugin, each new plugin, allows us to take advantage of parts of what has already been translated before, then reuse, that is, if I already have a plan registered on other platforms, what better way to take advantage of them than to take them as they are, add the  modules and to get used to the functionality quickly and there is also a space to add  r compatibility with new platforms in particular now The bad thing about this prouch is that you have a version of two Apps that take into account each plugin on the one hand you will have the app and the reverse engineering platform to which the plugin intends  interact and on the other hand the Epi de guidra that will also have its modifications over time some plugins depending on their extension and and their functionality may have to be written from scratch and that does not make it does not make it too interesting no  because you have to write exactly what you wanted to take advantage of was to be able to write everything quickly and suddenly you have to write everything from scratch and you no longer have too much too much problem to do And finally the internal ones for guidra and Aida can be very complicated to translate  There are things values ​​to Doc and and functions that are sometimes not available in the documentation and and you have to adopt criteria  s more than bestford of the best possible approach future work can be extended and it is basically to incorporate new parts of the Epi improve the architecture and we can incorporate plugins with other languages ​​that would also be good and the repo is coming soon in a few weeks in my  github left space here go there And that's all thank you perfect if anyone has any questions regarding the talk you can raise your hand if you can't get closer to the microphone in the middle we open again Farewell to lautaro thank you and we prepare to give him  welcome to Salvador Mendoza
