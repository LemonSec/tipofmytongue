Well, welcome to you, Octavio With a loud round of applause [Applause] Good, how are you doing? It sounds so good. Welcome to exploring the hidden attack surface of routers. Today I am going to tell you about a vulnerability that we found with Faraday's team in the river in the  realtek sdk for an operating system called Ecos that occurs in routers and Access points and this vulnerability affects many devices of different brands we are going to start by talking a little about how we chose the initial target for this research as we did the first recognition of  device I am going to talk a little about the operation of this system that has certain particularities, the Ecos, later I am going to tell you how we analyze the firmware and how we find the vulnerability on which this talk is focused. Then we are going to discuss a little exploitation strategies and post  exploitation in this type of devices that have some peculiarities finally I am going to  to tell how we automate the firmware analysis to detect the presence of vulnerability in other devices from other brands and I am going to close with some but first a small presentation I am part of the Security research of the faraday team together with Javier Aguinaga Emilio Couto Octavio  good guy all these people contributed to the resorts that I am going to present today but Octavio and I the two eighths were the main researchers of this project We are students of computer science at the University of Buenos Aires here in Argentina we see I am a biologist but hey one  A little long story, they came out, are you interested, I'll chat later, and we really liked playing ctf with our team, Fernet Injection, there must be some around here, and we focused more or less a lot on reverse engineering and binary exploitation, and the interesting thing is that when we started this project  neither of them had done anything in hardware then  s our motivation for choosing a bayout-style device was precisely this reputation that they have for being insecure, we thought it was a good opportunity to test these skills that we already had a little developed in reverse engineering and exploitation, so we opened up a little about how  we chose the initial target for us it was evident that we had to choose a router because if you take control of a router you gain access to a local network and at the time of starting this work it was the pandemic and we saw that it could also be an opportunity to pivot  not in a business network We also decided to choose a popular Target To maximize the impact of the things we were going to find and we also chose a relatively cheap router because we thought that for a brand when designing a cheap router security is not a priority and then having everything  That in mind what we did was Search for the best-selling router in an eco  It is very popular here in Argentina and we decided on this router, the next nebula 300 Plus, which at that time was the best seller with almost 40,000 sales and well, as you can see, it has very good user reviews. It is a fairly basic 300 mbps router, but apparently  achiever is based on a realtech shock which is the rtl8196e that shock has a 32 bit mips processor but is also capable of running 16 bit code to reduce the size of programs And on this device it works Well then once we choose  the target we started with the first stage of recognition We did what everyone does we went to the manufacturer's page We downloaded the firmware and we ran gamework but this was not the classic router that has Linux and a file system but just there  there was a bootloader and a fairly large compressed binary and we wanted to start reverse engineering that binary but we couldn't guess the log  in address no And then we couldn't start the reverse engineering process So we got one of those routers we opened it and we wanted to Connect to Word but what we saw when we opened it was that it had hardly any duat and it didn't have any place to solder them luckily either  for these shocks the data sheets are liquefied And then there we could see that there are two Sun Pins that are intended to save at that time I was working from home and did not have many tools to leave the hacking So with what I had a  cork and some little legs of a resistor plus a logic analyzer that Javi had lent me, well I put together this little device that touched those Uber Pins and with that we got the first router blog And that helps us a lot because there we could see that among the  things that were printed were printed the address of the first function that is executed Inside this kernel And that did not work because the login address of C  armen is very close to that Knowing that we can finish guessing that address and start the reverse engineering process and when we loaded this image and started to analyze it the first thing that caught our attention is that it was a mixture of a lot of things between those  things a real-time operating system called Ecos an implementation of the ellipse a web server called Google and a bunch of custom code from the manufacturer and other sources all of that was stuffed into this huge binary Well let's talk a little bit about this system of things is  an open source system is a real time system is posix compatible that was good for us because we felt more comfortable with all the calls and it is designed to be lightweight and very very customizable The idea is that the developer when compiling this kernel can  choose which modules to put in and take out and then block all that with your code so that it remains this binary that is like very fair  or let's say for the application that the developer needs because they think that this runs on embedded systems that are limited and part of that philosophy of being very light makes this operating system have a single process. However, despite having a single process, it can do  concurrency because it can cause a lot of stress and a peculiarity is that they can access all the memory space of the device, it does not have virtual memory, there are no privileges, and every time one of these three crashes, the router restarts, so that's good. Anything you do  with the router messing something up the router reboots well once we had a little more idea of ​​what was in there and what these things were on a generic level we started to really reverse engineer and focus on a lot of the custom functionality  i had this router implemented on top of all these open source projects the first thing i tried to do is  apply function signatures to recognize all the functions that were in the binary and speed up the reverse engineering process taking advantage of a lot of these things will be open but the first problem we ran into is that there was no vendor Release of all that code then  we put together all these projects that we could And from some strings that we found in the binary we recognized which was the compiler and we hid all those projects in the most similar way that we could to the router however the signatures that we obtained were not useful to us later we found a touchhing  liquidated we repeated the process with that the signatures did not help us either so well we were a bit defeated but for this operating system there are people who have managed to do that and here I leave the link in case you are interested well we could not apply the signatures but we had all  those projects that are open so we could go back and look at the code  I say at the same time and there naming all the things and also for these for these more or less cheap embedded devices one finds a lot of firmware links in Javi that didn't help a lot well with that we started to revert the custom functionalities and some of the  The first thing we look at is a shell. If you connect to this router via WhatsApp, you get a shell that is not a Linux shell like the one you are used to. It has a lot of commands that allow you to change the configuration of the router if you have a lot of things and  that helped us a lot in the reversing process also because of course by pulling the names of these commands one begins to understand a lot of functionalities one of these commands is very good because it allowed us to read and write memory And again since there isn't much  memory control you can read and write what you want but well of course you can write what you want but if you write in a place that  it's not mapped whatever the router Crash arrives and restarts and as well as you can write whatever you want you can also write about the code and that's super useful and we're going to use it a lot well another thing we observed is that one could  enlist all three that were running on the device and of course as this operating system I did not test processes or it has a single process So to speak all the functionalities that have to run concurrently are implemented as a being but there is no distinction between kernel and use  nothing So that one has the 3 I don't know responsible for the networking stack like running next to, let's say in quotes, the web server for example another interesting feature is that to coordinate all those all those things that the router has to do these three communicate  each other passing messages that are simply a train ID and a String for example here we can see below when one holds the button apr  reset state a long time there is a set that is listening That button sends the other one wants to reset the router to the factory settings and well what we wanted to do the most after understanding all these functionalities is try to dance it but if it did not have Hardly to  playing less is going to have for shaper And in this in these liquefied documents about the processor functionalities we saw that there were some Pins that could be assigned to yacht but could also be assigned to input and general purpose opus and this route had them assigned like this  and they were being used to control the lights and to listen to them when the user presses the buttons Same we tried to enable J tag this is done by writing to a register that is memory mapped but the router was crashing because it was accessing those registers We tried to Disable the  Watch Dogs of those things but I don't pay attention every time we wanted to get up I died But good  no There we are a little more attention to what happened every time the router believed that it was this, a damp of the status of all the registers appeared, a Start trace and there was also a little bit of the beginning of the stack content that is not seen there but  well it also appeared below and actually if we think about it this looks a bit like what one does with a dyback no when one is changing something good choose a place in the code put a break point when the code you carry stops one sees all this  Internal state of the processor and memory and there, well, you can edit things, you can continue. In our case, we had that, that is, we could see the internal state.  address of the code when the execution reaches that part the router will grow it will restart and you will be able to see the status you will not be able to edit you will not be able to do a lot of things  as But hey It was the only thing we had and it was enough for us to do a lot of things and how one does all this editing of the code in RAM when the router restarts it works again as always good And once we had understood these particular functionalities of this router  and we already had identified more portions of the code through the reverse engineering process, we wanted to try to find a vulnerability for that, we wrote a hydra Script interacting with the API that it has to consult the intermediate representation of the disassembly and we used that to search for calls to the  vulnerable classic ellipse functions like String copy or men copy but the destination argument is on the stack because We Tried to Lookup this class and the source argument is not a stringer that gave us a list of a few places in the code to look at  but going through that list we found this little bit that is down there that was very interesting because  which grabs a line of characters And used stringer to look for a space if it found it it looked for a second space and if it found it what it did was copy from there all the direct content to the staxin check nothing this is a classic But hey before  to understand a little better what this code does in the context of the router We have to talk a little about voip zip and sdp which are two protocols each time one makes an IP voice call a session is first established using a protocol that  Call call the sdp protocol is used to negotiate how that multimedia exchange will be in the call no And these two protocols are from the application layer and they are texts they look like this they are quite similar to the http protocol But what we are most interested in  what is striking or what is striking to us is that despite that layer 7 they have P addresses and ports And this is super interesting Because when you have a phone that is in  a network that is internal behind a router that does Nat and that phone is going to use this protocol it only knows its local IP and in that packet it will put its local IP when the packet goes through the router the router has to rewrite it and change that  IP and Port for IP One of the router and an external port later when the external person answers the router has to do the reverse process so well here we have in the part in the headership there are two times there are two ips and ports and also in the part  sdp is the one that will interest us the most There it is, for example, in this case it will be exchanged in audio using rtp, for example, there where it says m audio and the router will change, for example This is an outgoing packet that will change all  the local addresses for the external addresses and an external port Well then now we return to the function but with a little more context what the code does is try to run this line m same audio which is the one that d  it writes the multimedia that is going to be exchanged and tries to extract the port that is going to be used because that port is the one that has to be replaced but then what follows rpp 0 is what protocol is going to be used to exchange that audio And what format And  You don't have to change that So the code that follows tries to find those two spaces to later copy that once you have changed the port but that's where it doesn't check anything and well one can score a goal So we have a function that rewrites the sdp data  in these zip-type packages that have a Buster overflow and in theory we should be able to grow the router by sending a small packet of these but that you have a lot of gas after the port and since the router rewrites both the packets that go out and those that enter this  it could also work with a package that comes from outside which is super interesting so well we put together a vp package with the content that you see there with a lot of ga  s after the port and we send it to a Random port on the router because when we reviewed the code we didn't see any check of that, we only saw that the source port was checked, which has to be 50-60 and we sent it to the external IP of the router.  router One when we looked in the Word logs we saw that the router believed with a lot of Haz in the stack And this is super interesting because we can trigger this vulnerability without any open port on the router and it works from IP One but even more  this is interesting because there is no part in the documentation of these routers that says that it has this functionality if for LG it is this functionality of the routers that rewrites the packets it does not appear in the documentation if one enters the web configuration interface of the router no  you can enable this functionality And if one connects to that console by Word or is also available by telnet if you activate it you can enable the functionality but not p  To persist that configuration is to say that when the router restarts it becomes vulnerable again, so it has a hidden attack surface that is not documented and that has a very high impact. Well, once we found this, then we wanted to try to exploit this functionality, how complex would it be?  an exploit on a Target like this The answer is Not much these routers don't have aslr they don't randomize memory addresses they don't have write and execute protections on the stack So one can do the classic ctf prouch of writing shell on the stack  and skip execute the only thing to watch out for is that the con shell can't have multiple nulls because String copy is the function it describes AND these processors have two separate lanes for Data instructions So if one wants to make a self-modifying shell  Well it's a bit more complicated but you can keep things simple and you can do a lot of exploit  easily if one deals with a lot of things that have to be fulfilled for the function to go well No, because if one does anything route than yesterday and Well, it is very important that it does not crash because we are going to lose everything we did because we are touching memory and  Also, because the user could realize it, then to exploit this vulnerability what we did is take a package very similar to the previous one, leave some padding handles and write there to call is the code to call now function that turns on the telnet service and then use  this functionality of messages to ask to ask the router to turn off the firewall after that we try then to rebuild everything so that the router returns without crashing this function a non-crashing return to the router does not reboot well there are some local variables that need to be set  also so that the function ends well and we point the ritual address to our buffer And then when that  function finished the router will execute our Jacob once that is the code we are going to have tele enabled and well another thing that this router had was a background on the internet so one can connect through there but for now we already have  code execution on the router So if you don't have that vactor you can still change all the settings do whatever you want Well let's talk a bit about the exploitation It then we enable telnet and there we get a shell on the device it's shell again it's not the  linux shell that we all know and it doesn't have this device doesn't have a fire system so we can't upload a binary but we have this function that allows us to write memory and then we can write our code the one we chose is telnet has these commands and these  commands have their handers and are in a network like the one seen on the left of the screen where the name of the Com is  ando and a pointer to the function that is responsible for sanding it And so what we did was write as a proof of concept a port scanner and inject it into a memory location using this Write Command then step on one of the commands and point them to  our recently uploaded code it is important to take into account that all the code that we use to upload is self-contained or we have to know the addresses of the functions that we want to use to be able to jump into the execution But hey This we have access to all the API of  this Ecos operating system And we have the functions of the ellipse So that helps us a lot to implement our scanners we wanted to make a scanner without But hey, we had to use the sockets And that was not implemented in this kernel in the end we made a tcp Connect scanner that is  a bit slower but we use this multiple lift thing to speed it up a bit it's still a bit slow but hey it's a test  eba of concept and the only thing to keep in mind is that when one builds this code that it is going to write directly to the memory of the router when compiling it, that code has to be aware of which address it is going to land in so that all the stops work  and you have to define the addresses of all the functions that you are going to use within the memory space of the binary no good we automate that with a Script that you can see in that repository and we write the binary using this Memory Write Command as another example  interesting voice exploitation there is a group that gains persistence in the firmware receiving the firmware is also very good to look at and well now a small demo of that so here I am connected to the router at the same time by Juan and porlan now I am entering through Lan to  I go to the administration panel there I can see then the IP One of the router And if I go to the administration part I can see that having is disabled  Or maybe we try to see that it doesn't work and we scan the router to see that the stop port is not open and well now we can send our exploit that you are going to start by compiling this code that will later inject and send this package to enable net  and once it does that then we can see that now the port is open and there we are already logged in and if we touch center what will happen is that all our Second stage is going to be written to memory And that takes a little bit but when that finishes  we are going to have a new command in the router that will be our port channel there If we list all the commands we have a new command and we can use it to scan the same router and see, for example, that now, in addition to the web configuration interface, it has  the TNT port open and good now as a proof of concept we scan another device that was in the local network at that time we see that it has some services and we are going to t  try to replicate that same same result but scanning it from the router we cut it a bit so we don't get bored But hey the results obtained are the same [Applause] Well then by now we had a functional exploit in this model of router But there were several  things that caught our attention and that made us think if we could use the same thing to exploit other devices. The first thing we saw is that these commands that appeared by having or by Whats had a subset called the store commands and store is another brand  different from next, which was the manufacturer of this of this router. In other words, in all that code that there was, in addition to having realtek code, open source code such as Ecos, there was also code from another manufacturer that potentially caught our attention And then we  We began to fix the How was the Hardware of Tenna devices and we saw that they were also based on this family  from Sox from realtek called rtl819x the one on the left is the one we were looking at and the one on the right is one called tenda 5 years ago that has the 8197 and we downloaded the firmware to that device and we see that it also ran Ecos as well  We looked at what the web interface of these routers was like. At that time, we had already found another brand between brass that is sold a lot in Brazil. As you can see, I hear several people laugh, they are the same except for the brand and also many of these devices are very similar.  physically so all this made us think that they were OEM devices out there made by one or two manufacturers and then branded we looked and the vulnerability was present in those firmwares and in many states And so before jumping to exploit all the routers what we did was good  contact someone what happened to us was good we have all these routers that have the vulnerable code they are from different brands and they work  purposes that is vulnerable is a functionality that is quite low level that is, it is in the network stock So it seemed unlikely that one of these brands has written that code and we decided to contact the chip manufacturer directly to realtech and realtek answered us super fast  and he told us that this vulnerability was in his sdk and what that means and meant at that time is that any vendor that built their routers with these chips AND used this realtek cdk if they didn't do it with reviews and doesn't realize that this  vulnerability was present so automatically your router was vulnerable and that was what motivated us to automate the firmware analysis to be able to catch any suspicious router take its firmware and automatically know if it was vulnerable or not for that we have to look again a little How is it  the vulnerable function if you remember has two screenshot calls that look for spaces and then copy the buffe  r with this copy but of course we had put all those names manually during the reverse engineering process and now if we grab a random signature we will not have them so what we did was again use this hydra API for the intermediate representation of de  compiled to try to make a kind of signature that matched this structure, what we do is first look for a function that has the Mapfre in the stock as its first destination and as its source the result of having called another function and in turn that will be  the result of having called the same function in turn we also check that the second argument of these two of this function that calls twice is the space that we saw not and well we can build code that tries to Search for this in a  binary And if it matches then we can have some confidence that the router has this vulnerable function this takes a long time then to speed it up  or what we did was run it only with functions that have strings related to this protocol but to do this we have a problem that we have to solve first if you remember we started looking at bingo and we didn't know in which position the kernel was loaded and we solved it by connecting by  Word, but if we want to do this in an automated way, we can't do it that way, so we went back to look at what the bootloader said and we realized that it had these messages, we reversed the bulldogger, we found the code that was responsible for printing those messages and among the messages there were  a function that we call kernel shopping because what it was doing was decompressing this kernel in the direction indicated by the first argument again here When we do Sorry, this function is surrounded by three calls to printef with those strings that we see and we know the  of these strings in the image But again  Before we are going to know the names of the functions when we do this in an automated way so again we have to try to follow a pattern where there are several calls to some addresses that are separated by some offsets that we know and between the first two there will be  a function whose first argument is this address that we are interested in, which is where the kernel is going to be loaded. So if we find a match of this pattern then we can extract from there the address where the kernel is loaded and then pass all that to hydra and  do the compile automatically but again we have to know where this bootloader is loaded if we want to solve it with tour or something more advanced But the bulldogger code is very simple And then it can be compiled sorry disassemble in a linear way and we can do  capston that although it is not as powerful as what we can do with hydra, it is not useful for this code that is simple  There are other ways in this operating system to get the kernel numbers there if you are interested you can see other ways But hey once we managed to get around that problem So we put together a Script that first started with capston disassembling the bootloader then the problem ends  kernel address passed that to ahidra and tried to find the vulnerable function and that code is uploaded from Javi you can look it up There is an example with how it works with the firmware of this router that the first one that we started to investigate and once we had This  So we went back to the marketplace and looked for all the brands that had routers that physically resembled each other and there were those of those brands. We downloaded all the firmware and ran this tool at that time we found 13 vulnerable models and in April 2022 in this marketplace throughout  Latin America there were more than 100,000 sales of these devices three months later in July those sales  they had increased to 130,000, which means that these devices were still being sold actively And this is only in Latin America So we believe that the number of vulnerable devices is much higher But also these were just sales and at that time thanks to Daniels and africa they came up with  a way to realize how to identify the panel of these routers if the person had decided to expose this panel, that is, to expose the configuration service to the internet, this is only a subset because it is not activated by default, but we still see a large number of  routers and what helped us a lot about this above all is that they are not only in Latin America and when we started looking at those panels we saw that there were a lot more brands all very similar and when we looked for what the routers were like they also looked a lot like each other then  With this we were able to identify 31 vulnerable devices from at least 19 brands, some of which are the ones from there.  And if you have doubts about whether the router you have at home is vulnerable, well, what you can do is go to the vendor's page, download the firmware and run it through the tool, or it's also very useful. These routers have an empoin to heving down.  flash you can download a dan of the entire flash and if they pass that to the tulle it will also tell you if your router is vulnerable or not Well then to close we started investigating the best-selling router here in Argentina and we found a vulnerability in a function  This was not documented, this was super interesting because it allows an attacker to have remote code execution through the One interface of the router and does not require user interaction and above all it cannot be disabled from the web interface, which is the recommendation that one gives  could give a user disable this this functionality can only be disabled by accessing this command line But hey that could access  r to an end user and although one of that recommendation when the router resets that is lost and because this is important well because this was a hidden attack surface that could only be discovered by reverse engineering it was difficult to detect and the fact that it is  in that altec decline ended up affecting many devices of different brands, this in turn shows that vendors do not review the code provided by the chip manufacturer because most of these devices that use this cdk are vulnerable there  some that don't have the function maybe realized or decided not to include it by chance but most of the devices that use this one here are vulnerable and well you may wonder These are relatively cheap routers but the more expensive routers have to be a bit  a little more landscaped more to be more resistant Well at least there are more of these brands the most expensive routes are  Also based on these chips And in this cdk and you get more functionalities, for example You can connect with your cell phone to Claudia and cover your router and do things like that but it still has the vulnerability and also You could ask well, business routers are more  low damaged not good for that I recommend you watch the latest flashback team talk where there is a Bass find a buffer overflow in the VPN functionality of an enterprise Cisco router and good This proves that buffer overflows can still be found in 2022 in the  devices connected to the internet and it leads us to the question of good Why did nobody see it before this is a relatively simple vulnerability Well from the point of view of the Chip manufacturer they do not have a security mainzer When we reported this vulnerability and altec thought that it was only  could reboot the router with this an attacker would be very difficult for an attacker to get executed  ion of code taking advantage of this, on the other hand, evidences what I said a little while ago that vendors do not review the code that comes to them from the point of view of the spring because this was not found before, we believe that it is going to be good engineering  Reversing this huge binary where it's hard to apply signatures makes the process a bit tedious and from the users point of view Well they don't even know that the devices have this functionality after we snipped this the vulnerability was assigned the cb that  you have there and realtek broke it pretty quickly on March 25th of this year but to date most benders haven't flashed their firmware with the patched sdk so most of these devices are still vulnerable even when vendors release that  signed patch on many of these devices the update is not automatic and users would have to manually update them  So this vulnerability is going to be around a long time to close So these internet connected devices may have vulnerabilities in functions that are not documented And that makes them difficult to audit and also code that is introduced early in the supply chain can  reach the end user without ever being reviewed. Also, if these devices are produced by manufacturers, they are OEM devices, it will be that several brands share code and share vulnerabilities for an attacker. This is an ideal scenario because you can find a high-impact Back without much knowledge.  previous Remember that when we started this research we had never done a Hardware hacking project Well if you are interested in the subject and there are a lot of references on these topics that I was touching on and I hope you liked the presentation and I thank you for having Well yes  someone has a question can  move to the middle or if I don't approach with the microphone as you prefer, raise your hand Hello, how long have you been called from the stomach since day 1 since they decided to investigate vulnerabilities in routers until they want? Well, let's call realtek, they helped us for a long time  What took us the longest was this process of doing manual reverse engineering, not being able to speed it up with any strategy like that. I think we must have spent a month naming functions and trying to understand how the router worked, after that I don't know a week to do the Script and find the  vulnerability out there one more week for a few days for the Crash but a little more to achieve an exploit and then a little more to have a more interesting proof of concept so good a couple of months or so Congratulations from a question on behalf of  Back Wanted Argentina I want to make you I imagine that a company as big as realtek will have offered a good v  agon and for this, for this end, I already imagined where the question came from Well, what happened was this, not when we started the process. They thought that the vulnerability was not so critical and that an attacker would not be able to use it to execute when the  The process progressed at one point and it became evident that they thought that and I told them no for this if it is critical and I had to send tests we had them Sorry this investigation was for the entire group and well then the guys say ok The critical vulnerability there is a  backgrounty program A few weeks later we received a notification that we could claim our payment and I entered the link And it said that it was 1000 ntd and ntd well I went to look for it because I did not know what it was, the newtagonist dollar and when to convert that to United States dollars  They were more or less 35 dollars. So you can imagine that charging that does not make any sense, it is not even enough to cover the expenses of the Resort and Well, we kindly told you now that  No, we weren't going to charge it. Congratulations Octavio, thinking of making those 35 dollars profitable and since you mentioned the sip thing that was exposed in the One interface, I wanted to ask you if you had found some kind of credential that was in memory and that protected the  It's time to make calls from the router, maybe calls could be made that will help make those 35 dollars profitable, obviously they would be from the subscriber.  I decided this I had never seen anything about telephony over IP So we focused much more on the exploitation and I don't know if that can be done but if you want to make it profitable later some other question how about I wanted to know if in all these routes you found the vulnerability  the field on which you put all the as or put the code for the overflow as long as it is with the same protocol  or for everyone no no the function I there in the example said that I was leaving audio but in reality it is this field called Miriam scription Field of rpp but what follows can be audio video any type of media if you have to respect this  format of the media type the port and everything that follows will go directly here and with anything from rpp grab that those who have the vulnerability do not have to say rp anything that is, it just has to be one of the media types of  multimedia and a port and then copy if no one else has a question Ah ok I didn't see it well no congratulations The question is if in the analysis they did they detected computers that had already been compromised no I mean one knows that all this type of issues of  service generation attacks etc. goes through this type of device if they were able to detect that some computers were already compromised if we do not focus on detecting the exploitation let's say in the Wild  e of the vulnerability And it would be very interesting to track that, the reality is that to exploit each device you don't have to make an appropriate shell code for that firmware image that will have things in other directions So if you use this vulnerability And that  I didn't hack the router, so I don't know the only way to detect if it was there or not, basically it's to crash a router And that's a bit invasive, it's not something one can do on a large scale, let's say thank you very good talk very good research question  They verified the patch that Real wanted you And any plans to continue doing a lot of research on this zip protocol on this router or some other protocol on this same router or firmware We have not verified it yet Because although Realtek has already broken this code that the benders give you  and we, no, I don't know, they were not interested in us reviewing it on our own. In other words, we could just review it by getting some firmware where El  vendor the brand has applied the patch and we still haven't done it And the other will ask me to continue yes if you plan to continue doing research on this same protocol in these firmware or where does this research continue with this routers no I think the protocol  It was something particular about this but it's good to keep looking at these routes because there are a lot of routers that are cheap or that have this type of code quality, maybe because of the contrains that the Hardware gave them. Well, a lot of things that I don't know  You can

1134
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,640
evaluate, but I don't think it's something

1135
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,740
specific to the protocol, but to

1136
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,900
how the supply chain of this

1137
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,520
type of device is and that's why it's

1138
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,359


1139
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,300


1140
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,140
good to keep looking at them.

1141
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,359


1142
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,598
