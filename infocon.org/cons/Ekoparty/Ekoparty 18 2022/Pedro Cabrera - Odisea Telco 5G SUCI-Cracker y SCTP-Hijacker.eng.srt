ours also begins with a miracle The Miracle of 5g because we are talking about the Miracle of 5g Because if we read the standards and all the documents theoretically we find new identities and new mechanisms that protect the identity of the subscriber the famous inssy I don't know if International Mobile sounds familiar to you  their squarever identity and this would solve an old known problem sometimes known as insi catchers fake stations stingrase has many names which obviously well seemed to be or may be a miracle on the other hand if we look at the Core of the network or at the en  the core of the 5g network the protocols we also saw old acquaintances protocols that were part of old versions and were reused here all that caught our attention is here with me Miguel Gallego I am Pedro Cabrera and we got down to work to investigate if finally this  He had all the earmarks that he looked like Al Milagro and whenever we start an investigation  tion, since it is necessary to analyze the state of the art, which was what other springers had been seeing so far, we met José Picó and David Pérez who in 2019 had made a first presentation of the most theoretical aspects of the 5g altar networks and  revisancar very well-known had also done in 2019 and 21 two papers, one on new vulnerabilities and others on the Sims and catchers in 5g we always saw that they were theoretical analyzes finally in 2021 David ruper and Merlin klostad do a job too Well yes an analysis on  5g Sushi catchers and we want to mention it is not a work of resers But hey there is a document, an RFC or a Sport comments Fifty to collection that mentioned it also collected in the past since the year 2000 attacks on a protocol that later we will see the sctp we wanted to mention because  It was the good state that we found ourselves initially, which was what we wanted, our objectives, or where they wanted us.  we wanted to attack, you know that the nodes of the network establish associations between them or links in the core or in the nucleus Well, we wanted to attack those elections to be able to hijack them, take control and thus be able to become a node of the network and therefore  On the other hand, as it has been introduced before, we wanted to see what attacks we could generate against these new identities that the networks were introducing. Let me briefly introduce you. This is a reference architecture, it is from etsy. It is called Network functions virtualization in fv and you will see that there is a little box.  red think I like to think of matryoshka dolls these are one doll inside another inside another there are a lot Well then we found a paradigm of contained containers you are seeing it in red inside the vnf which are the virtualized functions the virtual ones  Network functions we can find containers and inside the container we find the application  n This is the scheme that any operator in the Core needs to be able to provide the 5g service and I want to call your attention in the upper right part of the screen there is an area called the management hand there are three elements and above all is the orchestrator  If you ever wink if you have seen the movie Ghost In The shell Well, if you have the master of the puppets, that is the one that the orque orders, forgive me, the one that will govern the two elements that are below the vnf manager and the Big manager  that is to say, it is in charge of governing resources and services and that architecture is the one we have followed We have wanted to implement the attacks in an orchestrator We have called it The sharp Because strator our orchestrator is based on oai is an Open source for 5g opener interface This orchestrator is  the one who is going to direct and govern all our attacks, so we wanted you to keep in mind that we have not invented it but just as  up there like 5g all the commercial solutions Well, they always require all this type of dynamic solutions on the pipeline se icd to be able to generate all that we wanted to do the mccaaching attacks on the Wild, that is to say, in reality, not because of its wild nature but we did want to  that they were real attacks on commercial networks, the first thing we had to do for this was to see if there were commercial 5g networks deployed, it would not make sense if in reality, when we have outside the laboratory, there was still no commercial 5g network, you know that for good to be able to deploy  It is done in phases, that is why we mention or what has been called 5g nsa on standalon appears, it is a 5g network where only the radio antennas are 5g the core of the network is still 4G in other versions well it would have been called 4.5G  but here Call 5 gmsa has been preferred and 5g already appears, we are going to call it pure where both the core of the network and the antennas are all 5g and it has been  called standalon or Solitaire where everything is pure Well, we did a guard driving I guess you all know what the guardavivin is we leave with the car the suitcase we combined two techniques on the one hand we used software devices to define radio sdrs the famous setus and on the other hand we had  5g mobiles with applications that what they are doing is constantly collecting the GPS information and the information on which cell we are connected to, what technology it has, etc., etc. that allowed us to generate that heat map that you see there, we are based in Madrid with what  which we started in Madrid to see how well we have anonymized the data, it is not about comparing which operator has, we wanted to see that of the three operators that we have called A B and C, one of them did not yet have these data, they are from February of this year, one of  they did not have any r5g the operator that called me B had both networks both sa and en sa and the operator a sol  or had in that But this was the perfect climate we knew that we were going to be able to test the results that we were going to find in the commercial networks very well the next thing is to tell you about that old protocol that we had found is the sctp Stream control transmission protocol I am going to be very  Briefly, this appears in the year 2000, maybe the s7 networks sound familiar to you, it is the single interconnection network and its number Seven system has to be migrated because the physical layer was very old and migrated to IP and as you can see above the little IP box  This transport protocol appears very similar to udp to tcp It is mainly Niche in the telco environment and as you can see on the right in ngap New generation IP in 5g It continues to be part of the ngap and IP layer sctp worth I'm not going to  I want to mention two things that are very important. The first is that when the initial communication is established, there is a process of handshaking or f  orway handsay occurs in four stages and the two nodes that are going to make that communication generate a valid number, it is called verification tag, it is the number that they will always use next in the rest of the communication so that I do not want to call it authenticate because that is not a  authentication, but it is what they use to know that they are talking to the other node and that he is who he claims to be, obviously, that is simply a number with which, well, well, that is there, and on the other hand, multihoming, any logical entity can be present in  plus the IP address, a node can have 567 whatever IP addresses they are and that is called the multijome because I am telling you all this because we are already reaching the first stop of our Odyssey in that RFC that I told you at the beginning an attack was included that  at that time it was theoretical it was Hey there is a message by name you will understand what it is used for it is the board it is used by a node to say Hey I want to break the communication  ion or that association I want to abort it well if I as an attacker am a third platform and I create my own message and make the node to which I send it believe that another node has sent it, I am going to break that communication between the two nodes the only thing  What we need for this recipe is to obtain the verification tag, which is what happens, as it is transmitted in the clear and it is a number. Well, there are two great ways to carry out the practical attack: on the one hand, intercept a Man in the middle or, on the other hand, do  a brute force attack as it is simply a little show we can test numbers numbers numbers very quickly surely some of you are already finding some way to paralyze this make that attack fast it can be good they are two different techniques if the verification tag is obtained that way  as you are seeing in that diagram when an attacker sends the abort what he does is break the connection we wanted to adapt this to 5g allow me to show you  introduce the node the genode B may not sound like anything We didn't want to make this theoretical That is the radio node it is worth thinking about the antenna that is transmitting genre B has to be connected to the amf the Access and mobility management function the only nodecore that  what we are going to do is with a Script made in python now we are going to go to the video we are going to send the mf an abortion But he is going to think that this abortion comes from the genodobe well as I told you the first thing you are going to  see in the video is the initialization they are all containers based on docker with which we have to deploy the network You will see that it starts in the terminal below we are in phase 1 we have 4 little zones on the bottom left we have started the  deploy and up you are Seeing that we are showing the blog That is the sharp because it is traitor that is as you can see on the stage scp contributes tag is starting We have a lot of elements with which you  We need to prepare our genode B, which in turn depends on the sdr, it is verifying everything as different phases of the verification go by, it starts up, it starts up, it continues when I get to a moment that has Go, we look at the WhatsApp that is up on the right  that we are going to see how our legitimate genre and the amf are going to be associated You are going to see the fourway handsay and nitrat Cookie echo cookieia ck and the two steps of ngap that are simply a setudes and response the genode B as you are seeing below starts transmitting  the gqr X a spectrum analysis our genre B is emitting in frequency and you see a small screen floating around very well if we tell the mf in the bottom left to Listen to the associations you see that it is associated with a genodobe that we have underlined in green  In other words, this is the normal environment, the network has been set up and the two nodes are associated, now the attack begins, look at the bottom right where they write python v  to make a very simple attack it's an rp spuff we're going to poison the rp tables of the two nodes ok fully documented attack haiti nothing to do with the telco part When we do that attack what we do is a Man in the middle as the traffic is totally free  protect let's say in clear text we get there you see the verification tag we have underlined it in red when we get that number we go to the terminal on the left where in python we are going to build I guess you all have heard of escape we are going to build our love message  We are going to send it to the mf, making her think that the person who sent her that message is the genre. We translate the verification Tab with the minus V parameter and look at the wizard that red message that you have seen in red is the spongy work. We usually send it to the  mf so that you can see that there is no type of history we go back down in the terminal we are going to tell the mf to Listen to us the associations that have  and notice that there are none, that is, we have broken communication, the genre has found out, you will see that it continues to transmit, there are a series of messages that are sent at a certain time, they are called herbit and they are there all the time, which is used to know that they are alive  You see in red when it was seen that the boil has not responded to it because the sensation is broken finally stops transmitting Well we were getting closer to our first stop I insist it was simply we wanted to show you the spoofing of this tree Why Because we are going to use it but to kidnap  the link if we only do that the link gender B would re-establish communication what do we want to do to pass ourselves off as a fake genodobe and here comes the multihomic that before we had told you about us as attackers as you can see in the diagram on the left  first we are going to make love We are going to break the connection and then we are going to introduce ourselves very politely to the mf and  we are going to say that we are the new genodobe we have multihomin and we are in a new correct IP address so for you to see the demonstration we are trying as we know that there are four terminals and there is a lot of information trying to facilitate the monitoring of This is worth knowing that the attacker within the  Rank 1726 its IP ends in 158 the legitimate genodobe is the one that ends in 164 in the same Rank in about 7226 and the Core is very easy because its IP address is 192-168 okay in this video we have gone through the initialization of the  network obviously we are going to start again with the deployment of the 5g network or that is where the legitimate association will begin there we have it initialized and phase 1 the start of the network the same we will see in WhatsApp how they do that initial association with the Fort  Way scp and lng Setup request and response which is the top layer ngap very good when they have already raised everything we proceed the genre you have already seen that floating window is about  there we go we put it in its place that is up to here the same as we did before the network is already up and we check the association asking mf Hey what gender do you have for me and there you have it in green That is the legitimate one now We start the attack again  On the one hand, we continue, well, we continue, we do not continue with the interception each time the link is created, the new verifications with which we have to start this whole phase, we inject false arp tables to place ourselves in the middle and obtain communication between the two nodes, the only thing that  The most important thing we want is to obtain the verification tag while we are preparing the python Macro Script at the bottom left, this is going to be much longer because it is going to send the job But then it is going to wait because it is going to be the one he is going to  start your own Forward handsay with the amf there you have it we have the verification Tab We have many parameters in the Attack Script because we have to say Which one first  it is the ip of the second MS What is the ip of the and third What is our attacker ip are the three elements that are going to take place in this first stop we are already being the sctp highyaki because we are going to hijack it very well unless upload the  The most important parameter, the verification Tab, without it, the amf would not pay any attention to us. We need to replace it with the verification tag and now we return to WhatsApp, check it up, we are going to maximize it. You will see the red line, which is the first abord, but then you will see how  with the attacker ip good This is what we have put To be sure there was a lot of information with which we wanted to review everything that we did review and there is our tree we have interrupted the first one and set the Forward hansek from address 158 that is to say the  our mf is responding to us we have achieved it and also we have also obtained the Setup request Andres Pons that is to say we have broken we have intercepted with him scp F  orward huntek and we have succeeded if you look at the beginning we are telling him That is the multihoming feature where we are telling the mf that the genodobe is in those two ip addresses in this way we achieve the total hijacking of the link between gender b and the amf yes  Now we tell the mf to list us, you will see that pl mn00001 appears there. This is our false genode B, but the mf has no way of knowing that it has been attacked and that this node is really us here, finally the first stop of our Odyssey  in the scp hijacking attacks we continue Thank you very much in the beginning it was all The Sims and catchers a lot has been said about the simsi catchers the second generation of mobile phones did not have the ability to authenticate the network but it appeared in the third generation  the famous 3g or umts, yes, you could verify the mobile phones, the way for the bad guys to fix this situation was to make a fake cell, it doesn't matter  rvice but I was going to do the first phases of identification that way I could get the IMS and from the victim but what I was going to say later is I'm so sorry today I can't give you service Go to a 2g network that also happened in  4G and obviously we wanted to see if we could adapt it to 5g these attacks are called dangle Attack what it achieves is to deny the service to the mobile But only a technology with the purpose of the mobile ending up in a false 2g network is also done a lot with jumpers  if we call the 4G 3g frequency at the end of the mobile it will only be able to connect to the fake 2g network we wanted to make it use the calls logically with our orchestrator our use because strator in this case the victim is the phone we are no longer attacking the network we want to attack  to that ui to the user a quidment that we are going to reject as you can see below with a registration request and the most important thing is to choose the reason for rejection I have you q  You have to reject But if I reject you too much I'll give you that of all I want to reject you only 5g, that's why we are underlining cause number 7 5gs Services natal oysters in green, well, this seemed the most appropriate to us because what I am telling you on the phone is that  today there is no 5g But I am delighted to give you 2g service to do this demonstration You will see in the following video We are going to give you a Faraday cage and a briefcase to the right You will see, do you not remember that laptop we made it known billsocket is the GP  from Pocket Well there will be running osmocom with our fake 2g cell and on the left you will see an Intel noob where our sharp will be running because strator with the fake 5g network which is the one that is going to do the downgrade attack let's go  To this, as I was saying, as always, there are those who have to initialize the 5g network with Play's, we speed this up to make the videos faster, that little window that you see at the bottom right is the laptop.  It has three terminals I don't know if any of you have played with esmocom network in the Box well it's the nytv with the TRX and the bts is a 2g cell ok it's there just running we leave it running while the 5g network has gone up and always what  is going to do is reject any guy with the reason for rejection number 7 with a mobile so that you can see that this is not tampered with we have recorded on the one hand the gpd laptop That is the usrp b200 below you will see that it is connected to the faraday box  where our victim is, who has kindly lent himself, is in airplane mode on the left. Well, you can see that the genre has already been torn off, there are the two antennas.  airplane Miguel very kindly proceed to remove the airplane mode of the mobile as it is a 5g terminal when you look for cells there it is removing it the first thing it is going to do is look for a 5g network it is going to connect to the r5g that is very interesting to the mind  a  say I'm very sorry today I'm out of service you have seen it in green downgrade number Seven and what you are seeing now in osmo.com those green yellow lines blah blah blah there we have the index of our victim look for good that you see that this is not  something leap of faith we have used the truck rider Pro where you can see that what it tells us is that we are connected to the mobile you see that in the type of connection it is gypress gprs it is connected to the 2g cell and so that you can also see that that chaos number Seven  It is not an echo or a print if we go to the traces we wanted to show you the rojet magazine You are going to see that the cause is indeed 5gs Services note Low the second stop could not conclude I suppose that everyone here is saying my God of my life how is it  It is possible that today this is still possible if it is present since the second generation. Well, we are not going to give you any commercial solution. But there are many solutions so that you can see  gilar or control when you can approach this type of attack there are two types based on Android requires a previous job of reverse engineering because to analyze the traffic we need access to the baseband with which Someone has had to do the reverse engineering or the firmware  or the communication with the reel, which is the Red interface layer with Android and will be able to access and process that information. The alternative we go to Linux with an sdr or with the mocom we can use a phone with a SIM card or analyze all the frequencies and  They are going to let us know. I mean that there are some of these solutions that, to determine if they are under attack by a false cell, compare what is called the C ID or the Celio identity fire with a database. And if it is, they say that it is  a legitimate cell not ever in that kind of solutions because the id is something as easy as a text parameter that you change by hand so you have to parse the traffic  fico you have to see the behavior And now I'm going to leave you with my partner Miguel Thank you very much Good first of all Congratulations because you have reached the middle of this journey of this Odyssey because now We are at the third stop from here we are going to focus  in attacks on the identities of the subscribers, as many of you know, the 5g specifications have proposed multiple mechanisms to improve the security of this technology and one of them tries to solve the problem of The Sims and catchers who take advantage of the fact that the identity of the user of the  user of the subscriber or the imssy is sent in clear text on several occasions and that they have proposed how they wanted to solve it well they have defined two new identities on the one hand the supi or the permanent subscription identifire this this identity can have two values ​​the imsi or the  nail the nai we are going to leave it aside because above all it is going to be used in private 5g networks and on the other hand it will go for what  that the imsy when we talk about them In this presentation they will be equivalent But on the other hand they have defined the sushi or subscription with shield identify as its name indicates this It will be the encrypted identity of the user And how they are going to encrypt it or what are they going to  encrypt Exactly Well, how they are going to use an algorithm, the encryption scheme based on elliptic curves that we are not going to go into detail at all. The important thing is that it will have several entries and each time it is calculated, it will be a different value, although  has been derived from the same identity and the Good thing many of you will also know the linksy that is divided into three parts the country code or mcc operator code mnc or user code Well, the latter is the user code the part of the imsi that  Both the mcc, the country code and the mnc operator code will continue to be encrypted in clear text, however the 5g specifications have given the possibility of not encrypting  the user code How to use what they call the null protection scheme that you see underlined in red when the user registers the network with the null protection scheme the user code or MS and n will not be encrypted therefore we will have the code  of country operator code and user code totally clear, that is, the imsy us when we saw that in our first objective was to deploy an insi catcher a subicatcher in 5gsa And that is what we did we got down to work so we implemented  this attack our orchestrator in our salt because writer what we do is build a false 5g network as you have already seen and it will be constantly monitoring the traffic when a user tries to register to our network with the null protection scheme it will analyze this traffic  and get that clear and Here we are going to see our first demo one important thing to mention about the orchestrator is that it is important that d  deploy things in a specific order for stability reasons, first you have to deploy the Core of the network and then when we have the Core of the stable network we can deploy the node Rayo gnode B there we see how we have the mobile phone in airplane mode in  the faraday box and now you are seeing it the orchestrator is waiting for a user to register so we remove the airplane mode and the orchestrator will detect that connection there we have removed the airplane mode it has detected a connection and since that user has connected with  the null protection scheme we have all the incy as we see there the country code and operators 001 01 because we were using a laboratory SIM card but of course now we know that a 5gsa can be done when a user connects with the scheme  protection null But what happens if you identify yourself with the encrypted identity with the sushi as we have said it uses an algorithm an encryption scheme based on  elliptical curves that has several entries and one of them is the operator's public key this key will be stored inside the SIM card but what does this mean what does it mean that a key is stored inside a SIM card well SIM cards  They are smartcards that provide a file system in which there are different types of files with a defined hierarchy. We can find in red, for example, the master file that could be compared to the root directory in Linux. Then we have the decated files or the dfs that are  they could compare with directories And lastly we have the axes or Elementary files are the latter the ones that store user information they can store there is an f for Lindsay another for temporary identities for authentication keys there are many many types of Elementary files And what happens  with 5g SIM cards good that a new direct appears the directory of f5gs this directory t  It has different elementary files associated with it and it is in one of them The F sus where the public key of the operator is going to be stored, therefore here we have our first requirement for a user to register with the encrypted identity, the directory must exist  of f5gs with the associated elemental file that contains the public key because it is of no use to us that it is empty But there is another requirement for you to be able to use Sushi and it is related to the services of a SIM card SIM cards have services that can be active  or not and they will provide different functionalities and of course, new services appear in 5g SIM cards so that Sushi can be calculated, these services have to be active and also depending on which one is not active, Sushi will be calculated within the Terminal by  the terminal or by the SIM card because because it is an operator it might be interested that the Sushi be calculated by the card  SIM Well, use values ​​in the algorithm that are proprietary to increase security, for example, of course. So we already have here our first two our two requirements to be able to use the sushi, in the first place that the f5gs one exists with the elementary file that contains the public key  of the operator and second that certain services are active we have spoken before that we are using laboratory SIM cards but no attacker is going to be interested in that a commercial SIM card is going to be interested so we took the commercial SIM cards from Spain from the main operators that  we used in ward driving and with an Open source software we checked these requirements that we found that none of them had the directory or any associated service What does this mean Well, by force they are going to have to use the insig the null protection scheme and  we will be able to capture it if we have the subcatcher So it is  or is that what we did Test with commercial-free cards we are going to move forward because this is the same here the network is going to be checking all the time who has connected and we will see if the commercial-free cards of Spanish at least until January 2022 are  you can capture the we will go obviously we have searched part of the Lindsay for obvious reasons but we see how the MC of the Country Code 214 which is the country code of Spain we also wanted to mention this summer we were in Las Vegas and we wanted to see the status of the SIM cards there  in the United States and to our surprise, the three main operators all had the 5gs directory and several of them had the active services, however none of them had the elementary file that contained the operator's public key but it was invalid or empty. So that  made us assume that they could not use the Sushi they would have to use the null protection scheme therefore A  There is our third stop, the conclusion is that we can do in sicatchers in 5gsa, at least also in the Spanish commercial-free cards of January 2022, but of course we wanted to know what could be done if they use sushi And that is what we tried to investigate How  I have mentioned And this is the last stop As I have mentioned, Sushi uses an algorithm that has several entries that is the public key of the operator and we consider the following problem: What would happen if an attacker has obtained the inside of  his victim through, for example, a 4G insi catcher but now his victim buys a new 5g mobile and begins to connect to 5g networks with the encrypted identity the attacker would lose track of his victim.  can do about it we started to investigate to read papers and we came up with a paper that Pedro has mentioned before that of Merlin closta and David ruperts  in which they developed an attack to be able to relate two uses that have been derived from the same identity because let's remember that each time a Sushi is calculated. Although it comes from the same identity, it will be different, so I related these two uses derived from  We took that idea and extrapolated it to our orchestrator to find the relationship between an imsy and the Sushi derived from sense. For this, we are going to explain this attack and we are going to briefly see how the authentication process works. So we are going to start with 4G  We have two entities alys and Bob Alice is going to act as the mobile terminal and voice is going to act as the network so Alice, in order to use all the network functionalities, connect to the internet, calls, etc., has to register first, then she will send the request  register or the registration request in this request as we are in 4G Ali will register with your real  identity that would be Lindsay of course Bob is not innocent and no I don't know he doesn't believe it So he asks Alice to prove it by sending a challenge this challenge is the authentication request the important thing to note here is that this challenge the authentication recost is signed by  what For Bob to prove that he is a legitimate network then from here there are two two paths if Alice does not recognize Bob's signature she will not believe that it is a legitimate network So she will reject him and send him the message in red on  authentication, however, if it recognizes the signature, it will believe that it is a legitimate network. So it will authenticate with a green authentication response but what is the difference in 5g that changes in this process because the only thing that changes is the registration recost  registration request now Alice is going to register us with her real identity but with an encrypted identity however that is, the important thing here in this attack is that the rest of the process  of authentication is going to be exactly the same, that is, we can take the 4G authentication Records challenge and use it in the 5g challenge and that is the key to the attack.  and finally when we set up a fake network and when Ali registers our fake network with the encrypted identity we send him The 4G Challenge and depending on his answers if it is the green one or the red one we will know if that identity is related or not If that encrypted identity is  Alice or not So how we have implemented this in our orchestrator this attack has two main phases the first Although there is a prerequisite the requirement is to have the inci of our victim because no we are not going to leave it alone in Alice we want to do it to any yes So we have the  link of our victim and we can start with the first step with the first phase that is to find the authentication cost on d  legitimate challenge of this and MC in 4G for this we are going to use an Open source software that will simulate a mobile terminal that is going to connect to an external 4G network as the 4G network will have that inci it will return a legitimate challenge  and we keep that message for ourselves and we can start the second step, which is with our orchestrator to set up a false network and wait for any user to register our network with Sushi with the encrypted identity. We are going to respond with that challenge that  we had saved and depending on the answer if it is green or red we will know if that encrypted identity is related to our victim or not That is the key So summarizing we have the index of our victim of that inci we get the challenge  legitimate in 4G we keep it for ourselves we set up a false 5g network we wait for any user to register our network with Sushi and depending on the response to our message  We are going to know if that encrypted identity is ours or not And this is what we are going to see in the fashion now that we have called it Sushi cracker So we are going to in the first phase it will be to get a legitimate challenge then  we set up an external 4G network and we can start Now phase 1, which is with the Open source software of the mobile Terminal, is going to be connected. We already have the inci incorporated in that terminal, it is going to connect to our external 4G network and it is going to save, look down there  on the right we have seen how an attempt has been made to register Here we are going to save what we have applied in our project we are going to save the message in a Jason and we can start with phase 2 which is to set up our false network first obviously we set up the Core and  then we raise the radio node The orchestrator will check it will check if that Jason exists if that message exists so that when a user connects to our network using Sushi he can return a response  Onder him with that message there we have detected the Jason has found that legitimate challenge that we had achieved in phase 1 and now raise the network raise the gnb the genode b and now it will only be waiting for a user to register with that Sushi with  that encrypted identity here obviously since cards without commercials were not capable of using a Sushi an encrypted identity we have used the laboratory SIM card that we have programmed so that it uses a Sushi there we unlock the airplane mode and now to wait if the imsi of our  victim is related to the dirty no there we see that we have cracked the Sushi yes it is related to our imsy and now for you to believe it we are going to see the traces there we see the registration request that we see That in red it is using the encrypted identity and  we see that your response to our authentication request is an authentication response which was the green message in  so we know that the imsy is related to that sushi very well thank you very much thank you we told you at the beginning that we wanted to do in sikasing on the Wild and what you have seen so far are videos that Wild has nothing unfortunately each country has a regulation  different and forgive me for stealing your attention to tell you not to broadcast on mobile network frequencies what you have seen is in a laboratory environment you will all say eh if the faraday box is open it is worthless but we have some blinds etc etcetera  with which we do not want to invite anyone to transmit I insist that this the frequencies have a control a regulation is a crime etcetera etcetera any resemblance of that car with my car is a mere coincidence it has nothing to do but we wanted to say Hey if someone for real  I would like to make an attack of these in an industry in a factory in something as easy as it would be because the requisites  Cough and read the solutions Open shows on which we have based the computational requirements we Arms are going to hell forget about a 5 volt single Board computer and one goes to Power the backpack all that is not worth we wanted to see how easy it was to scale it  unfortunately 1 and 5 a mid-range i5 processor is not worth it either so we have to go or there are 7 or similar things with which we needed mobility and Power that gave us all that a car using a secondary battery with an inverter we had 220 volts and we could  go around going around I insist theoretically that is a simulation we have never done it we wanted to see if someone could use external antennas with a magnetic base if they could go around doing that type of story and obviously Well we saw how with the noocs getting in  in the trunk we could turn on and simulate this scenario and see that these attacks did not only exist in our lab  not only that Someone could carry them out and thus we are getting closer to the conclusions of our Odyssey I think you will agree with us that I believe that all countries or nations have recognized in some other way the importance of 5g technology and  In fact, they have made it a key piece either in technological development or in the development of their country, removing all the political stuff and the scandal that took place in 2020. I suppose you all follow us with the accusations of espionage, etc., etc.  become an emblem by becoming that emblem of development progress, certain papers and sources for 5g risk analysis have appeared, the security of 5g networks and what we invite you to reflect on is that it makes sense to analyze the security of only 5g networks, is there an operator  that today service with only 5g is impossible if you think about the geographical extension of your country Argentina Brazil Spain  na the operators do not have that money that outlay that capacity that muscle to create 5g antennas throughout the country is impossible with which it relies on the rest of the technologies we have not gone far behind if you go to the left side the little balls we have gone  In 2015, we asked ourselves how we have adapted some of these vulnerabilities to 5g, but there is much more. I insist you forget about that 2015 because we could go back to 2009. There are many vulnerabilities already published that are very easily adaptable, with which we believe that the vision of those  documents outside of creating Well, a political rigor, a public image about 5g security awareness, they do not offer a real vision of the risks or of 5g security, there is only one case in which it would make sense that if we go to private networks, if I  I have a private network that is only 5g, I effectively forget about everything else, but it is precisely here where the impact of the generalities that I am  that we have just told takes on special relevance Because it is not the same as if I already deny service to my colleague Miguel and leave him immobile all morning than if I refer a service to a train, maybe there is no longer Security and  It's sexy and we're talking about affecting real life, it's not the same for the owner of that factory connected to 4. If we deny the service because maybe we're shutting down the plant and we're already talking about business continuity or business disruption  or of an important revenue of thousands or millions of euros that will affect that service stop, it is not the same to locate the location of Miguel's friend or cousin than if we locate the location of a drone that will surely be managing traffic issuing fines  or controlling security with that we want to thank the organization la coparti for having given us the opportunity to be here to all of you who are here for sharing your morning and good It is  We hope that in the future both the attacks and the ones we have just seen are included in those documents that we not only talk about 5g security that we talk about delco security and if you think we are going to invite you to ask us the questions because we are going  time constraints if it seems to you instead of answering questions now we will be here all three days and it will be a
