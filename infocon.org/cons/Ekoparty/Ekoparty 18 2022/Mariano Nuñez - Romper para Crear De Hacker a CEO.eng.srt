15 15 please always minor good welcome to day number 2 of coparti just while we were chatting with Mariano we are trying to remember how the first ecoparties had been a place of very different people and for us the conference is a special place not only for what it represents  And because of the reunion and to see friends, but also because we dared to do something that for us was quite ridiculous to make them very honest, we said Yes, since we know each other abroad, it doesn't mean that there is no meeting point and with Leo franjero and Juanpa we said  Well we're going to do something and it was at the bauen hotel I don't know if they were the bauen hotel it's not very nice but it was special it was special Because we didn't expect anyone to come or we waited for our friends to come and suddenly there's a very long line they all stole a computer  they all suffered they got drunk the other day half of the people arrived but But one of the learnings that I take with me and always  I always repeat it to this day that you have to be encouraged because the opportunity is not there, you have to make it very beautiful, very easy to go out in the day to say We are all hackers but it was not always like that, it was a job and it was not  It is always easy to try to sell as you think you want the world you want to belong to to be with successes with errors with tests with successes and also with things that we always seek to improve and it seems to me that undertaking is a lot of that is looking for something that one dreams of, I have the  proud to present Mariano de croche who gave in that in that bauen the presentation of his Open source framework of Sapito so that they do not know and hate Of course Marian will not like it like this but and everyone including me we chose but you think that  there is room for a tool like this and he told me yes I think there is still room for much more today Marian his co-founders have a company of almost 400 employees something that was not easy something capable in  2007 neither he nor I imagined, far from it So the message of welcome to you at Eco a Mariano is to be encouraged that nobody is going to undertake it for you, you have to do it yourself and you have to start and you have to cheer up  and ask for help and it seems to me that learning from how entrepreneurs get it right and wrong is great learning Beyond the technical So yes, much more welcome to day number 2 of eco Party I want a round of applause for Mariano Núñez di crochet [Applause]  Well, how proud someone like Fede presents me. How nice to be here wanting to see everyone, as Fede said 15 years ago, I had the privilege and the honor of giving my first talk at the Eco.  de la Eco as I had faith in the hotel bauen hotel recovered at that time everything quite sinister at that time in the hotel we were about 50 people not about 12,000 as they are Today here passing through what  that they have attested to me, the entire Eco team is incredible and I want to offer a big round of applause for all this incredible growth that they have made because speaking of starting the Eco it is a venture and they really made it scale something incredible, a lot of time has passed since those  15 years after that first talk in the Eco I was a researcher I did offensive Security I dedicated myself to being pentes backhanting finding buns basically my goal was to break everything that was put in front of me I think that out there resonates a lot with what you are  Not here because breaking up is fun, yes breaking up is School, it's sexy, it's exciting, it's the moment you find that Back, the moment you manage to compromise that system, achieve the goal of pentecost, you have admin, you have Root, it's a unique Adrenaline moment.  they lived it I see several smiles they know what I'm talking about and it's a spectacular trill with a bit of the risk that makes you feel sometimes and n  something happens to you in the security community it makes you feel a little it makes me think that this is a little better than the one that made that system than the one that made that Software than the one that made that control and the reality is that on the other side Obviously  the universe of incredibly talented people who have another perspective that says yes Ok breaking is fun but defending is difficult as an attacker as someone who is breaking puts you are a hole out there two chain something but generally with a bug in that system what you are in  by attacking that surface you can take control of the objective by compromising the system But the one who has to defend is defending hundreds of thousands hundreds of millions depending on the complexity of entry points and one was forgotten and the attacker won and that is how we see it in the  news and we see in the newspapers how a company was hacked for an 18-year-old boy, how software has thousands of vulnerabilities and the reality that it has  and a pretty big symmetry here So even though it's easy to pat ourselves on the back a bit, say Ah, look, what a stupid company, what a stupid system, it's much more difficult to defend what I want to tell you is because you can  combining in a little bit of a weird way these two aspects to build your company in security and really go down a path that is not only fun but also difficult and that at the end of the day is a path that I think is amazing in conversation  let's go through a little telling My story telling the story of napsis The objective is to give you a little perspective of What it means at least from my experience to create a security company tell you some of what Fede said some of the successes that we had  thousands of mistakes and that we made and give at least one perspective and tools ideally tools so that you can also create your company in security obviously  Before this is a path I do want to clarify a warning here I generally stay pretty far from absolutes This is a path a set of circumstances and events that worked for me worked for napsis for the team behind napsis but it is not the  path Yes so obviously everything you are going to hear today and what you are going to be talking about take it a little with tweezers see how much applies how much doesn't But hopefully when the talk is over they will have a set of tools and ideas that they didn't have today  in the morning when they came for the Eco I am going to divide this path into basically three acts the first act is how you go from cloud to expert the second is how to go from expert to founder what is that moment like how do you go from zero to one for really the  The moment is when you create, you decide to create your company and what do you do at the beginning where to start that day 1 let's say where you start and finally from founder has been that this has to much more  to do with How to scale the company how do you go from having a project to a company on day 1 start scaling it and really out there achieve something that has a global impact and that generates a lot of value we are going to start with New expert first act Leo told me that something  What is very nice about the copartition is not obviously that many faces are sitting on the same roof and you are there. Almost 50% told me almost half the people who are here Today it is there it is your first echo for this your first approach of  security out there you are trying to figure out whether or not this is your path and you are sitting next to you and sharing spaces and sharing chats with people who are on the other end of the spectrum who are incredibly incredible experts in their domain some to  Sometimes they forget about respect, they forget that they were also newbies. So that's something else, but what you have to know as newbies if it's your first step is that everyone here was rained  Is there ever if all the people you are going to meet were newbies they were in the place where you are today we are going to talk a little more about this cover I ask for patience from the experts that we have here in the room and who are looking at this who have a little  of patience because here we are going to be talking a little more to the people who are starting out in the community and try to help them get to the place that you are today. The first thing I want to tell you is because I think this road is really beautiful.  The security path is beautiful between three fundamental aspects. The first is the entry barrier is quite low. Compared to other disciplines, only having a computer, having internet and having the time and desire, you can advance a lot as a self-taught person, reading practicing at home. You can advance from no  know nothing to begin to acquire knowledge of security skills the second thing is that the game changes daily you will never get bored if you go  In case you get into the world of security, you will never get bored, there is always new technology, a new defense system and someone will appear in a corner of the world, a 17-year-old or 15-year-old girl who breaks that system that changes the world.  status quo and everything starts again, the castle of cards falls, the new deck is dealt and everything starts again.  living since the pandemic and going forward, something that is not minor is that you get into security, it is very likely that you will have a job loss of a job that is fairly well paid for life to give you a little reference Today there are almost 4 million jobs  of work in computer security that is not so true they are not being covered Yes so imagine the demand that there is for this if they manage if you manage to become an expert it is very likely that for the r  This of your life is security, it will only grow. It is very likely that you will have a very well-paid job for the rest of your life. We will also see how this affects or how it is important for the following stages in my particular case. My  The story started like this with a little video. What a good way to start the day, not with that movie with that music. I saw this movie when I was 12 years old. I came across it. At that moment, there was something for the youngest. It was called a video store in the neighborhood where I went  you take a cassette and rent it for a couple of days that you have to rewind it then I came across this movie and what happened to me is that it blew my mind I think it was the first time I fell in love with something so strong I think it was first  Angelina Jolie when I was young at that time but more seriously I fell in love with the world of security I said by God I have to at least understand and explore what it is to be a hacker and obviously the first thing I did I already thought that it was  not this one I thought it was zero cool I had already seen the movie I was already a hacker the first thing I did was go to the hardware store and from the corner two blocks away you could see the Villa Luro neighborhood, a neighborhood here in the federal capital and I went  to buy me a brown relation spray cut with cardboard cut and for reference we had a computer in the house that was the family computer So when my parents see that suddenly the keyboard is camouflaged and there were three keys that did not work anymore  It was quite an interesting moment, but that was just the beginning of all the shits that I sent myself on this road, so I quickly realized that in reality I was this, I was Joey, no, for those who have not seen the movie, it is the newbie does not know  nothing. We bully him a little bit and he actually ends up in jail because he doesn't know what he's doing. So the question is how do you go from being a New expert back again? I think fundamentally it's very simple and it's reading it  study and basically study and practice reading and practicing reading and practicing the first stage is self-taught And if you have to have the discipline to be able to do it in my case there was also a somewhat fortuitous event that on a trip with my family we ran into someone who was selling  books on the street I came across this book by chance and there is someone who knows this book And this book is a book with 30 sheets or pages clearly not suitable for a 12-year-old in English I managed to get my mother to buy it  I read it I think I had 5% but I understood enough to continue convincing myself that this interested me and I had to get into the world and unix because Windows was used by the big guys hackers used unix so I installed Linux a grate 5.2 a CD I never got  You will also forget the adrenaline and the emotion. When I see this screen, what did it mean that I had Linux on my computer? Then I enter Root, the root prompt, to be in my own Linux  Here, too, the emotion did not last long, it was until I restarted the machine and it returned me to the Linux prom and then I realized that I did not know what the partitions were like and I had decided to install Linux on the Windows partition, so that's how they left  my old man's Excel spreadsheets my brothers' homework family photos also an interesting moment When I went down there to the family dinner to explain to my family that now we were all going to learn Linux now one important thing here is that you are going to have  What to decide is, I don't know if anyone ever heard this at home, it happens to me quite often, it's how you are going to dedicate your time to the computer. What are you going to do when you are with the computer? What are you going to do?  Gaming side you can be on social networks after losing a lot of time on Twitter be doing a lot of things that are not going to move you In that curve or you can dedicate yourself to learning to read to study See articles  online papers download exploits try things play at home and start learning and what will happen to you Is that when you start doing this you are going to go through perhaps this effect called the Danny Krueger effect which is is a correlation between the objective durability in a  discipline and your perception of your ability in that discipline not so quickly what they see at the beginning of the curve is that you start to take a little bit of skill knowledge and your confidence level goes up disproportionately no and basically you get to that very quickly  It's called the Mount of Stupidity here where all the people who think about everything and don't know anything are, in reality there are many people who stay on that mountain if I decided to continue, let's say continue deepening that almost inevitably happens through what is called the Valley  and the desperation where basically you begin to realize and you begin to know everything that you do not know, you realize that this is much more complex and that  There is so much more to know that you have no idea and you realize and feel a little desperate about how complex the path is. One of the hacks I think is the most interesting at this stage is going from hobby to work getting a job in computer security  It consists of a job where you can go from being a hobbit if there is something you do at home to being your main occupation. It is one of the most hacks for me, for me, for me it seems like some more interesting hacks to speed up your trajectory in that curve.  Firstly, because it allows you to surround yourself with better people than you. You will be working with people who are already further along that curve and you will be able to learn a lot. In my case, I was lucky to work with incredible people. Tadeo Lean Andrés. Nahuelito is leaving.  he left before I got to circus but a lot of people Vico Juan in force who helped me a lot on that path Julio before that helped me a lot to learn that path the second thing is  Super relevant is that you are going to pass the Lake in real life, it does not matter if you have 150 bms in your house If you use a test platform, the complexity or how a real company uses it and configures applications is very different and it is not  You can never replicate, so you can access to do a security test on those real environments. It's a difference between day and night. If you're really into it because you like that level, it's basically a dream. The kid, you're working for something that you're getting paid for something you wanted.  free Yes, so it's like the equivalent of winning the lottery and then something that is not minor It's good, you can't avoid going to jail because that can't happen to you when you're in this self-taught stage that maybe you're learning with systems that aren't 100%  yours And it is always better let's say to have authorization to do it in my case at 16 I think I had that moment I send an email to a person named Julio ardita Julio right now is  one of the Pioneers of computer security in Argentina is one of the Pioneers of the community they come out that helped me a lot to learn and basically expression I did not know Julio I only knew him by reputation So I sent him an email like this  out of nowhere which is actually the message I found the text message asking him he decided to give some courses and if he could start to help me in some way he answered me after three days that he was going to give a course at a school so I went to that  school I saw I saw him give the talk I went over after the talk and to make a long story short he ended let's say getting Julio to interview me he tells me when he realizes I'm 16 he tells me he couldn't hire me because I was too young I keep trying a  A couple more years at 18 I manage to enter and that is a bit of what I believe and I think that it can happen to you is when you start working, it is a creative explosion, that is, you start to go through  There is a moment where you quickly advance in that curve in that skill variable and your head really starts to explode. In my case, I basically did a little bit of everything.  at Microsoft in the hcp service on Ebay message learn to program in different languages ​​she is a reverse engineer and expulcreating I did many things that really opened my mind and helped me to advance a lot in my level of expertise The challenge with this is that  again yes These are your first steps in security out there you did not know the level of complexity behind security it is today that my old lady tells me I have a virus on the computer and I already want to kill myself because I do not understand anything about it  malware and there you heard but hey you work in security it is a domain there are a number of incredible domains that have nothing to do with one  It is very different to do architecture and dedicate yourself to architecture than to dedicate yourself to doing forensics.  I want to give here are some factors that I think are important to consider and that will be very useful when you decide to start and create your company in the next stages. The first one is half chichi and half is a half weird friend but it is what path you are passionate about that  You are really passionate about these domains and you feel that you like to do it instead of when you had to do it at work you wanted to kill yourself every time you got what you are passionate about and in what do you think you can be the best in the world in what do you think that  really if you dedicate yourself because you are so passionate about it and you can learn you can be one of the best experts in the world the other two points at this stage are not so relevant but it is important that you cons  Do you think that Juan is critical is the problem that domain how critical is the problem behind that domain and the second is the size of the market This is a critical problem that affects a very small group of companies or people or is it a problem  critical that affects many people or companies in the world and to close this stage is something that is also another hack that can help you in the following stages is once you become an expert you can start working on creating your reputation in security  It's an industry that relies a lot on reputation, credibility, trust, and there are some pretty easy ways with very little, basically no money, just with time to build your reputation, the first to develop Tools openers, publish them on github, make Tools and publish them, publish your  reesters papers blogs they don't have to be 50 page paper something new a new exploitation technique that you came up with  new way of doing forensics or a new published architecture and obviously a very good one is to present at the ecoparti is an excellent example that has a platform to start making yourself known as an expert in a domain in my case I was also lucky that I went to Black hat  my first Juan Blas conference in 2007 was also low and at that time I was a little smaller I only had two tracks there are not two Yes so they are like 11 I had to speak after David lichfield that I don't know you don't know if you know them  but it's like basically that your little rock band has the Stones as an opening act it's like talking after that is quite difficult and people let's say that around beats the names that are around only that around is where my talk was people who  She is incredibly expert in this, there is no way Fede said, says el Sapito, the definition of metasproid for SAP is exactly correct, basically a bridge is  of a frambu of SAP applications and That is the photo of the memory box of the one of the e with the bauen where you can see them, they can be seen a little, I did not find a better resolution but that was the talk 15 years ago there in  the Eco well this I think is going to be a little more relevant for everyone yes especially out there for the experts who were having a little having a little patience how do you get by expert ander I hope it was obvious but basically they are the same  four factors that we talked about before with the difference being that the last two are much more important now, it doesn't matter if it's something that you're passionate about and that you're the best in the world, if it's not a big problem to solve, if it's not a critical problem or The  Market is very small you will not be able to do in a company that scales something a side note parenthesis never never start My recommendation you start this way if the first two above all the first Do not check That that box  Yes, let's talk a lot later about the dark side of all this, go through the difficult times with something, if you started something that you are not passionate about, and only for the money or because you want to not have a boss, those are the worst reasons to start a company, you won't.  to be able to sustain you do not have to do this you are escaping from something but when you are going something and in this case the last two factors are critical the criticality of the problem is really an important problem that people or companies are going to be willing to pay for  resolve yes here you start to learn everything a little more money money investment and the size the size of the market is a very critical problem for a very small group of companies where you will have initial traction but you will never be able to scale it is a market that you think  that out there not out there no At the moment where you start now but in four or five years you see the probability that this will become a much larger market  And then there is this idea of ​​when not that is what in what domain beyond the vision is not the mission but it is the what domain are you going to play Where is your company going to play that you are creating then there is this idea of ​​jumping into the void is when  when Tomás when an expert passes by who is probably already working in a dependency relationship and you say Ok I'm going to start my company tomorrow here what he called the point of no return what is this you have to do when you can't spend another day without doing it when you  You realize that you are going to lose the opportunity that the window of opportunity is closing that you see that there is one there is an incredible value and opportunity and you are not capturing it as I said before it is not to not have bosses it is not to escape something yes  it is that you are not in me in my head you are not at the point I do not return there what you have to do there is change the high pitch but a company does not start and the other is very poetic this to say jump into the void no like yes  Well I was in zipsec and I risked everything and jumped And although it could make me look better and it would be a slightly more poetic story, what I want to tell you here is that I think they are not like that and this connects with what we talked about before as  I said before there is an incredible demand to work for work in computer security if you decide to do this and create your company obviously I know I am aware I am talking a bit about a privileged position where perhaps you should have been able to save a little because you are not going to have a  very important salary or you are not going to get a salary at the beginning so you have to have some savings around to be able to start or get them But the reality is that if it doesn't work out, it's not that you're going to stay on the street, it won't work out for you  to be able to return to your work as an expert relatively quickly Yes, with which the point of view of if you are Adjusting for risk is much less risky than you think that this does not turn out the worst for you  so that it does not come out and return to the place where you were at least to be alarmed quickly that all the disciplines do not pass in my case that led to the creation of anapsis first of September 2009 we created anapsis and basically check all the factors that I told before it was something  What we were passionate about was not so much the we weren't passionate about SAP as a platform or time with the business systems but the ability to break that market to really change how those business applications are secured was something that we thought we could do the best in the world was the  which is fundamentally by critical definitions, these applications handle the most sensitive information and the most critical processes of the largest companies in the world and it is something that, precisely because it is used by so many large companies, has a market size and gigantic potential. This is the  photo with Víctor Montero one of our co-founders when we made the first business plan there the date the time  it's like 11 at night So after a couple of beers as you can see it doesn't make any sense this is our business plan imagine if the top 10 is web 2.0 contacts How much did we know what we're doing we didn't have  We had no idea but what we did know is that it was very important to start in the office a place that gives a good image that gives perspective if clients visit us who say Wow these kids really is a serious company So we started here this is literally the  Vico's bedroom what you can see up there are some beams up there there is a little ladder there is Vico's bed this is before they existed as an Office no out there the rooms many of us look like this today as you see ergonomic chairs yes ensuring the  health of all of us That was the two laptops I had the powerful one because this was I had the SAP BM with 512 megabytes of ram our firewall there on the right and  obviously the boleadoras because one never knows when a goleadoras can enter so they were there you are with us already with the team right left Vico Víctor Montero I Juan Pablo Pérez echegoyen and Jordi santanciere who was the first member of the team to speak a little more perspective and not  there go to a lot of detail in a bedroom where there wasn't that one in the San Telmo neighborhood here in the capital a house an old house there was no heating So in winter it was to work with the jackets on and in summer they don't want to know Jordi  and Juanpi will be dedicated to the development research part to start developing the first version of the software. I basically did the market development part, sales marketing, positioning, development of the alliances and I locate towards operations that basically all the rest for everything to work we were a  year developing the first version of the Software called napsy sex One we published it in  September 2010 and in October 2010 a month later we got our first client which turned out to be this So if you can see a little bit of asymmetry between the kitchen where the software was made Let's say if the type of clients we are at school are United we are very grateful  that the Army did not have a camera looking at the kitchen looking at this So we started very strong from 0 to 1 with a lot of scale and we had to break muscle very quickly, but one of the lessons that we learned here that  I want to share that it can be useful to you that you should be ashamed of 1.0 the first version of your product is something that is said a lot in the environment is if you are not ashamed you shipped too late you took too long you missed an opportunity for those who know a little about  code That's literally part of the code we shipped in that first version to that client part of our exception handling we're not freaking out  with a bar that was quite random we couldn't school So we ended up implementing this return One in the exception system which basically for those that are from software is the equivalent of closing your eyes crossing your fingers and let's say what he bought us  Army was a combination of the software software license and a three-day course So I went to Bama in 2010 to give a course to 10 people from the army, a military base, a good movie, you had to leave your phone outside, they scanned you.  They were escorted to the bathroom that was right there in the conference room But they had to escort us to wait outside, it's quite uncomfortable But obviously if you think that what happened was that the software was terrific, that's not what happened This was the Back that we knew, no I mean  and the problem was all of us who didn't know We started the course 10 people 10 brightest people I've met in my life security experts start using the software against  against the SAP system and he starts to raise his hand. Yes, I do. You have a question. The software hasn't just grown. Well, that happened 20 times during the day.  you're getting them from that one in that bedroom But they know you're not IBM knows you're a startup they know you're just starting out and if they're going to forgive you The bags as long as you overcompensate with incredible response time and incredible customer service  In that case, I ended up hitting it cool with the kids. So when they raised their hands and said that they had created it again, I would go with my little horn and tell him, show me what you did, so they basically turned into Cuba for us to reproduce in  the bank would write it down in the notebook and return after 8 hours of school to the hotel and stay until 2 in the morning suffocating all the backs and return the next day  in the morning with a new version for everyone and obviously it was déjà vu because again raise your hand and but that was during three pretty stressful days but the Army is still a Client for many many years so again Yes if you are in this you are  starting if you are developing software and your engineering boss or someone tells you it doesn't have to be better we have to continue improving it is not ready to agree to tell you the story of four kids in a dormitory in San Telmo who could do this with the United States army  Probably I can't do it too, to close this part I want to give some perspectives about this stage of going from 0 to 1, the first is you do it with partners Or do you do it alone [Music] a thousand percent My vote here  all my money goes to partners ok let's talk about the dark side but it's so hard to get through the tough times just probably harder with the wrong partners ta  I was also very lucky to have two people with me Víctor Montero in Juan Pablo Pérez de Chigoyen who were not only incredibly incredible professionals, they were even better people and it is today that they are still the partners, they are still the board of directors and we were able to do this only because  we did it with them the second thing is you are going to be a service or product company again all my money here goes to product it is very difficult to scale a service company they do not give you margins it is very difficult to get talent it is very difficult to scale one  product company is more difficult to start you have to make a stronger initial investment to start before you see some money but it is to start once it takes scale it is like compound interest this explodes it can explode and finally this we could be out there talking 18  hours but you are going to get up and it is very independent of the particular situation but you are going to make an investment you are going to get up  ar external capital or are you going to do what is called bootstrapping, which is to finance basically with your own operation, it is how to make it a lung here again, it depends on many things, but what we did to me was to make a hybrid, we started the bus by mopping, we started selling security services  We depend on SAP but the key difference here is that we did it with the first objective of being able to have some money to pay the land for the team but more than anything to develop the software against real environments so we could improve we use our own Software that we were going to  We are selling to perfect it in real environments, capture a client for services for now and then sell them the Software that did not work well enough. The mistake that I see that many Commentaries commit at this stage is that they begin to provide services and quickly because companies despair because they do not have  income you start to do services that are not aligned  Those with the Core are not aligned with the domain. We were offered to do web application testing, do consulting, do other types of services that if we had taken them, you end up deviating very quickly from the mission and one day you wake up and realize that you had a problem.  general services company that is what you want out there but if that is what you want to do from day 1, do not deviate in that way and then what we did was raise investment once we had traction another of the advantages of this is that you can  get traction you can show traction and when you raise an investment basically essentially you can get better terms and a better valuation and not have someone offer you two pesos and 50 for 50% of your company. So if someone at the moment is in this dichotomy and is  think about raising investment Write me that I have some several scars and lessons learned there where I believe there are no options with the cult  ura culture is I remember when before starting an App I saw things about culture and I thought there would be a verse that was people in a stove with the guitar playing Calamaro songs and then I realized that it was the most interesting definition of culture  It is Netflix, which is how things are done, how decisions are made. We have a manifesto on the basis that we create it at the beginning with some of the values ​​and behaviors that we hope will happen for the people who are part of the team.  from the tribe as you can see there on the right there is one that is remember you wants yes never forget that you also do New and many many behaviors and concepts like that but the simplest way to see this is essential human values ​​in our case is  the value for respect, integrity and the Owner that has to do with that if you have to do something you do it and Tomás and you take care of it so that it goes well and it goes wrong you do it  charge that went wrong and you were not pointing out saying that it is the fault of another good last act of fander like this I here in the concept that I out there many know the subject of the muscle the muscle the human being When one exercises the muscle grows because in reality it  it breaks down the microfibers tear when the muscle regenerates grows Yes I have this energy to break muscle because you are going to go through when you think about scaling up a company you will go through many stages where you are breaking down muscle And you are stopping doing things that worked for you until  yesterday you have to change them tomorrow or today and that is quite painful but it is a way to grow the first strong decision you have here is that you are going to stay on the Tec path, are you going to dedicate yourself to continue adding the technical or you will be impaled by business in my case  It was quite easy for me because I always love the technical part of security. But I knew that it was not what I was going to want to do all my life, so I  It was a fairly easy transition for me to go to the business side, obviously you have to deal with your own research team that I know are out there, then they bully you because they say that the universe is ppts, but if you go through that and deepen it  you're doing well The important thing here is that you can't do both or you're an exception let's say out of the ordinary that it wasn't my case so you have to choose one and make sure you're complementing yourself on the other side living in the market us since day  One is today that we still do not have a commercial force in Argentina or Latin America. We always come to the United States and Europe by design. I think it is impossible to do that well if you do not go to live in the market as I continue and this obviously I have been here for 13 years.  living in the United States in 2013 to start the company that has a lot of great things But obviously it has a lot of challenges there you realize what it is to be an in  migrant you realize that in Boston it is 20 degrees below zero in the winter and you realize that it gives you a very different perspective and it is another in another part of breaking muscle where you have to start from Zero in my case without knowing anyone to  To begin with and the last thing here is the investment round. I think this is the part where I broke the most muscle, which is going from reading books on assembly and exploiting to books on temeshits and how to negotiate and how an investment round is structured for me.  I particularly loved it again, that's why I say this depends a lot on each one. I loved going through the incredibly difficult process, especially the first rounds. I agree that something I didn't say before is another from 0 to 1, which is interesting, is to participate in incubators or programs  ventures that helped us a lot we made government programs Buenos Aires undertake at that time we took financing withsoft we participated in something called devor  And that helped us a lot in causing us and understanding what a business plan was that we needed that gives you a lot of structure and begins to connect you with people who are in that world and that can eventually lead you to make a round of investment, they helped us  we went I went to Silicon Valley in 2012 supported by one of these organizations I presented myself in front of I pitched 18 investors the 18 told me no and not real they started a separate council no investor tells you that they don't tell you that you are great that you  congratulates you for the attraction and they tell you that if you are close to La Ronda de inversión that you notify them or anything that is not like that in an investor, remember that it is not the only thing they do not want is to miss the opportunity in case they are sending a [ __ ] in  Actually, you are a gold mine and there is another that takes you and invests you so well, many experiences here with the investment round if someone is going through this process more than  I am delighted to give a little more perspective on where we are today after 13 years, but it is a source of pride. We are truly consolidated as the leading company in our segment, obviously not in the entire IT security domain, but in our market, business application security. We bought our  main competitor a company in Germany in 2019 we used to today we have an amazing team of three more than 300 zones in nine countries many are here and really without you without all we did together this would be impossible so thanks almost 30% of the  100 of the largest companies in the world today are customers, they use our product, our technology that we initially developed here in Argentina, we continue to develop it here, now we are expanding to Germany, we are expanding it to the United States, but it is something that we created from here, we just announced it this week, we continue to break, yes  We are not going to leave our roots either, we continue to break  strong we just crossed a thousand siro days that we find in business applications and publish and in recent years based on the attraction of billing and growth we have become one of the fastest growing technology companies in the United States now new would be very nice  That's where I should close the talk here I feel good I'm happy I'm down and everything is fine but what I think is very important that many times it is not talked about and it does not appear in magazines and it does not appear anywhere is the dark side of all this and  The dark side in many cases is quite dark. The first is the difficult decisions, as I continue, you are going to have to make difficult decisions of a lot of kinds. In general, one never thinks that companies run out of ideas, they don't know what to do, the problem is like  yes or no it will be that no you have no ideas, proof that you are going to have too many good ideas and you are going to have to make discretionary decisions about whether to do the idea or the  idea B that there is no right answer out there you invest in such and such a product you go to such and such a market you do such and such a campaign and you will have to have the ability to make that decision and support that decision and lead your company on that decision  that we have doesn't mean that the company that you said was no good, which is even more difficult to have that discussion, answer in the really difficult decisions and the really difficult ones are my perspectives that have to do with the people that have to do with it.  when you have to sit someone down and tell them that that day they are running out of work that they are not going to be part of the project and those are the ones that take out a piece of your voice, they take out a piece of your soul, I think there is no way back to explain to  Simply understand that they are difficult, but you will have to have the ability to take them. I think that this is where values ​​are very important. Wherever you have, do it in the best way.  possible for the person who is being affected if you think that it is a difficult day for you and that you end up taking a piece of it you have to have the perspective of the person who is telling you this goes home and has to tell the person  family that doesn't have a job So this is something that just sucks And that and that it's very difficult but that you have to hopefully it can't be that you have to go through it and it's just a very dark part of the dark side related to this this topic  The values ​​and he are just business. In other words, as the company scales, there is more at stake, there are no more interests, there is more at stake, and I have a mental limitation here, but I cannot distinguish the Mariano from the business and the Mariano  from my house, so I can't start from scratch, there are people who justify actions or attitudes with, they're just business for me. I don't know if that exists, but at least I can't do it.  values ​​because it is very nice for a slide with values ​​and it is very nice to say that you do this or that but those values ​​are going to be tested very hard and staying aligned to that is very difficult after you have the uncontrollable ones, not here it is I think  which is a bit funny it's not human beings we can't control our own thoughts but we want to control what happens in the world but more in a practical sense I'm going a bit metaphysical but in a practical sense it's not controllable for example the pandemic if we  we had had in 2019 incredible No thanks it is the best year of narcis we went to be fair it was 10 years So we grabbed the 300 people of the napsis at that time from the Junior who just entered That obviously I couldn't believe it until the  that the founders and we all went to Florida for a week to the United States a lot of stories that I will not be able to repeat in this in this in this talk but we are armed  We are ready to execute to break it in 2020 everything is given in the market and suddenly something happened that sounds familiar to you the pandemic that changed everything shook us made us readjust a lot of things and made us change all the plans having to adapt in  those uncontrollable it is difficult the inflection points the penultimate point the inflection points this is I think the maximum expression of breaking muscle because it is above all it is a high-growth company if you grow very fast it grows 100% year over time  in which you have to change and adapt your voice and adapt the organization is very short. So, for example, it is very different to manage a team of three people than from 30 to 300 to have a client than to have 500 to have a product than to have two or three the way  in which you manage communication, manage processes, the skills you need in your team, the skills you need in your team, leaders, is something that changes very radically.  cal very quickly and it is very difficult for the team sometimes to understand Why we have to change If for him what we are doing was working well and managing that change to really be able to lead the team and make them help the team understand give the context for them to understand  Why do we have to change? It's quite difficult. There are many people out there who don't want to make that change. There is natural resistance because they want yesterday's onapsis, they want the beginning onapsis, and there are people who can make that change and people who started as Junior and today are  managing hundreds of people in the Apps but it is very difficult and the problem is that you have to do it very quickly many times and anticipate that because if it doesn't already explode in your face it is much more difficult to swerve And finally I think that a sentence  which is used quite often, which I think is 100%, so starting a company is like building a startup is like putting together an airplane in the air. In other words, you are in the air and you have had  o Arming Arming and disassembling and Arming disassembling the plane and you have to have a lot of resilience I think that one of the essential qualities to be able to do that is resilience what you don't see is the cost of that residence the cost of having to keep the plane running  always on the air despite all this it can have an impact there is not much stigma a very strong impact on your mental health that of your team in my case I also have the blessing of my wife Flor and my daughter which I think is the reason why  which I did not finish going crazy on this path and I am eternally grateful But this is a very strong impact and this is if someone is also going through this sometimes with which we count on faith we get together with the boys who are in the same and  it looks like an alcoholics anonymous therapy session where we're all talking about this why it happens but no one talks about it if you see it you see the news you see the success story no one talks what's going on behind there is a lot  A lot of people with depression, a lot of people with anxiety, a lot of people, yes, they are from companies, I went back to having much bigger companies or smaller companies that are going through very difficult times because it is very difficult to close this as we started at the beginning, breaking up is very fun, but there is more.  I think that if we stay in the Back we stay in breaking that adds a lot of value to the world and that has a very important place in the world and we need people who are always breaking a bit. The message I want to give is that there is more than breaking for breaking  there is more value you can create that maybe you hadn't thought of before it's not jumping into the void it's not that good it sounds very poetic and I know it's a privileged position maybe it applies a lot to you just so you think about it if what if you do  If things go wrong it is very likely that if you are already an expert you can get a job very quickly to pay well to be able to at least rearm yourself and put up with you  support your family and move on and finally I hope this has given you some perspective that creating your company is an incredible path that is a unique path but I think more importantly that it is a possible path I am just one of the  case studies if you want Here are a lot of stories like napsis more girls much bigger people who are doing it today and it really is possible So unfortunately there are no excuses Let's say if you are thinking that it couldn't be done there are no excuses and it really goes  It's up to you

if you want to stay in breaking to break

1372
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,339
Or you wanted to start breaking to create
