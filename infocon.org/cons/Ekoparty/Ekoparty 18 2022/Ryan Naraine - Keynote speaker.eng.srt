[Music]

9
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,080
I am sweating I am nervous so please

10
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,360
bear with me I have no idea what Nico

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
just said

12
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,379
I assume he said some nice things about

13
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,760
me and I'm hoping that he did uh

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,840
uh where's my slides

15
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,640
ah

16
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,980
back there we go I want to start here

17
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,540
because when I get invited Nicole must

18
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,160
have explained that I worked for many

19
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,500
many years as a journalist so I spend a

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,840
lot of time going to keynotecon Keynotes

21
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,120
at conferences to try to find stories

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
whenever I find myself at the Keynote

23
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
I always wonder

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,940
why me

25
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,220
like why now what did I do my one

26
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,739
morning out and I ended up here my my

27
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,180
eyes are bleeding and my ears are

28
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,400
hurting because I'll let you in on a

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,379
secret I hate Keynotes

30
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,900
Keynotes I find are very very inane and

31
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,120
boring usually with a guy in a suit

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,280
usually he's representing a company

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,019
usually it's a very very big company

34
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,659
that is already paid for this keynote

35
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,700
spot and he's up here to tell you about

36
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,739
the changing face of the world and

37
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,599
transformational culture and digital

38
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,940
transformation and at the end of it my

39
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,800
eyes are bleeding my ears are running

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,080
so when King when when Nico invited me

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,260
to Keynote here not only did I go why me

42
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,599
I started to wonder why did Nico hit me

43
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,959
so much

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,340
uh why would you subject me to something

45
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,019
that I hate so much so that was my first

46
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,140
reaction my second reaction was holy

47
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,659
 I gotta find something to say

48
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,260
and since I don't do Keynotes I honestly

49
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,400
have no idea what to say and Nico and a

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,959
lot of the old Argentinian folks have

51
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,459
been behind me to write this book about

52
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,379
security so I decided that if I was

53
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,159
gonna

54
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,680
delete the keynote and if I were to

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,480
write a if I were to write a book and if

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,980
I were to come here and share stories

57
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,139
with you guys I would rather just come

58
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,180
and talk about my life talk about the

59
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,560
things that I've done the things that

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,899
I've seen and I want to set it up in a

61
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,040
way where

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
I wanna my introduction to cyber

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,979
security started in 2000 and 2001.

64
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,440
there was a warm era on the way there

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,540
was a lot of anxiety and anguish in the

66
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,699
industry and here we fast forward to

67
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,620
2022

68
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,800
20 years later and it feels like we're

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
very much in the very much in the same

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
place so I want to frame some of the

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,680
things that I've seen over the years

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,979
and talk a little bit about why

73
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,919
why we're here what has happened and

74
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,360
some of the things that will help us

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,759
move forward I'm trying to sound like a

76
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,100
keynoter so bear with me again at the

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,360
end of this here we're going to learn a

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
couple of things the first thing you'll

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,180
learn is that I also suck at creating

80
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,000
PowerPoint slides so I apologize in

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
advance the second thing we learn is

82
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,780
that we're all

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,060
the internet was a big giant mistake we

84
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,800
should just go outside close our laptops

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,479
and get some fresh here

86
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,220
uh

87
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,100
that's the dark dark side of it on the

88
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,080
bright side of it over the years there's

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,500
been a lot of incredible incredible work

90
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,900
led by hackers like you led by security

91
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,120
researchers like you and led by a lot of

92
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
folks in this room and a lot of folks

93
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,199
but in this part of the world who really

94
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,020
really put shoulder to the wheel and was

95
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,479
incredibly Brave at keeping vendors

96
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,580
accountable driving things forward

97
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,280
around responsible disclosure helping us

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,039
get to a place where a lot of you folks

99
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
could be compensated for your security

100
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,039
research work and hacking work

101
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,479
and I'm going to want to I want to spend

102
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,759
a little time as an old grumpy old man

103
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,860
and a curmudgeon to warn about some some

104
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,440
ominous signs down the road that sets us

105
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,120
back a little bit and unless we as a

106
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,160
community and we are the people here try

107
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,199
to take back control and take back the

108
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,940
power we're going to end up in some

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,340
really really dark places so with that

110
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,500
said setting the stage for what I want

111
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,380
to talk about my name is Ryan Narayan I

112
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,539
spend my time today podcasting and

113
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,340
writing about cyber security issues

114
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,819
still I spent my Twitter handle is there

115
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,919
follow me if you if you dare Brave I'm

116
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,359
usually just a grumpy old man

117
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,580
Point your phones and subscribe don't

118
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,919
pretend that this is a big site don't

119
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
pretend that you're all cyber security

120
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,400
uh folks who are scared because you're

121
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,900
going to restaurants and you're pointing

122
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,859
your QR codes to

123
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,880
uh like I said it's been a long road

124
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,560
here for me I've spent about 20 years

125
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,479
deeply embedded in security working

126
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,180
first as a journalist and then when I

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,740
realized that journalism didn't pay the

128
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,300
bills and I had a small family and I

129
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,100
needed to like almost double my paid I

130
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,080
switched to the dark side and went to

131
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,880
help vendors with Communications and

132
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
business strategy and user education and

133
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,620
Community engagement for some big Global

134
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,900
Brands around the world and my thing was

135
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,400
always

136
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,500
you have to be transparent you have to

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,940
be honest and you have to communicate

138
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,220
openly with the audience that's the only

139
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,800
way to to trigger an engender trust in

140
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,380
the industry over the years I'm gonna a

141
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,000
lot of this talk is going to be spent on

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
the bottom side of this here the e-week

143
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,280
ZDNet CBS security weekdays where I

144
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,520
spent time as an observer just watching

145
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,199
what was happening in the industry and

146
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,740
and and and and documenting it

147
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,319
after that I went on to Kaspersky I got

148
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,080
a really really good look at apt world

149
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,960
in the world of uh uh uh Advanced

150
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,660
attacks before going to companies like

151
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,639

152
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,860
little bit about I'm a sneakerhead I'm

about that here

161
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,099
over the years my career has given me

162
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,919
let me go back to the start

163
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,199
I'm from Georgetown Guyana a small

164
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,020
country just north of Argentina but in

165

in South America and in 1994

167
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,319
and migrated to the U.S and in the late

168
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,539
1990s I landed my first job as a

169
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,479
journalist writing about dot-coms in in

170
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,958
New York the whole.com ecosystem the.com

171
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,640
boom was happening and there was just

172
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,279
about to be this big massive bust

173
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,339
and I landed there and the the youngest

174
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,200
person in the room had to be the guy who

175
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,880
wrote about cyber security because no

176
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,279
one wanted it and these warm attacks

177
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,500
exploded so I would land it in the very

178
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,779
very early days in the wild west of

179
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,300
worms.com was busting we were heading

180
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,399
into what would would soon be 9 11.

181
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,240
there was code red nimda Sasser blah

182
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,019
Slammer uh uh where the warm attacks of

183
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,360
the day and the Twitter of the day was

184
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,459
full disclosure bug track where folks

185
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,320
were just writing and documenting the

186
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
issues that they were finding

187
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,820
I want to do a little bit of a side

188
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,320
track here and encourage all the folks

189
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,120
here learn to write

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,860
forget about Powerpoints and learn to

191
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,620
write everything in your in your work as

192
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,000
you move forward is going to be

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
dependent on your ability to write

194
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,140
reports and write things so they just a

195
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,760
little side note there

196
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,560
so I started out at the wild west of

197
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,080
worms moved through to the covered and

198
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,360
the other big story so I want to frame

199
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,920
this

200
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,779
see how terrible I am at keynote and I

201
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,279
want to frame this stock in a way where

202
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,260
these are all the things in my career

203
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,580
these are all the things I've seen over

204
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,220
the years the wild west of worms that

205
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,740
gave us the Bill Gates memo that drove

206
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,420
conversations around responsible

207
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,820
disclosure and microphone Microsoft's

208
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,500
attempts to Define terms for

209
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,899
vulnerability disclosure into the whole

210
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,839
no more free bugs Pawn to own let's take

211
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,300
back the amount of bugs take back the

212
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,480
thing that drove an industry that that

213
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,100
created and drove the bug Bounty

214
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,560
industry where hackers got a financial

215
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,080
seat at the table as bug bounties became

216
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,339
default

217
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,279
the problem with that is it starts set

218
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,959
into place some dark patterns that

219
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,300
created some big giant cyber security

220
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,459
businesses that have now turned around

221
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,940
and used bug bounties as bribery and as

222
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,220
hush money to keep things under on the

223
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,339
thing on the wraps and the hardest part

224
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,339
of it all is that unlike 2001

225
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,920
there are no Haka Community today to

226
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,380
hold Microsoft accountable the majority

227
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,820
of this stock is going to be focused on

228
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,560
Microsoft because I was a Microsoft beat

229
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
writer my job was to cover Microsoft

230
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,579
security over the years so I want to

231
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,860
frame this if I were to write a book

232
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,339
around here are some big chapters of the

233
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,279
book that really set us up for where we

234
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,240
are today

235
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,600
the people that played an important role

236
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,860
in driving all the the the the research

237
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,959
and fights that got us through this

238
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,500
ecosystem

239
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,480
and then I want to end with a little bit

240
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,980
of an ominous

241
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,040
feeling that 2022 starts to feel very

242
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,560
much like 22 000 again

243
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
and it feels like these problems are

244
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,940
getting harder and harder to fix and we

245
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,160
are allowing vendors and and Commercial

246
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,899
interests and money to control

247
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,980
everything

248
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,959
so this has been a bird's eye view to my

249
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,300
uh my my my kind of

250
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,200
place in this world

251
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,720
and I want to start with the first

252
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,640
chapter the first chapter in my book

253
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,620
starts in 2000 and I'm I I captioned

254
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,480
weapons Anarchy and responsible

255
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,000
disclosure back in 2000 there was a guy

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,339
named Scott Culp who worked at the msrc

257
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,959
the Microsoft security Response Center

258
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
he was a program manager there and I

259
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,959
want to guess he might have had the

260
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,339
worst job at the time because I

261
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,620
mentioned there was a lot of warm

262
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,200
attacks and Bug track all day drops and

263
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,500
so on and Scott Culp wrote a memo

264
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,380
and the memo basically describe decried

265
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,300
you guys like when I say you guys I mean

266
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,620
the hackers of the time the security

267
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,720
researchers of the time the software

268
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,220
giant wanted to clap down on security

269
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,860
for firms who were releasing Blueprints

270
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,380
and one of the things Scott Culp wrote

271
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,300
in this essay which was a seminal essay

272
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,440
at the time

273
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,180
is that he started to blame security

274
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,220
researchers for everything that was

275
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,480
happening rather than take

276
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,940
responsibility for what Microsoft's role

277
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,100
is in this

278
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,320
platform and ecosystem that could not

279
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,260
stand up to scrutiny the daily daily bug

280
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,420
Track full disclosure reports dropped

281
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,920
these things so Scott called Pro that is

282
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,420
high time the security communities

283
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,700
stopped providing blueprints for

284
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,920
building these weapons does that sound

285
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,180
familiar today

286
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,040
blueprints for building these weapons he

287
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,600
was talking about worms and viruses at

288
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,700
the time and he said it was high time

289
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,860
that computer users insisted that the

290
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,480
security Community live up to its

291
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,820
obligations and protect customers so you

292
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,320
realize you see this you see the game

293
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,940
right they're already starting to switch

294
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,639
the responsibility onto the security

295
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,440
research Community the security research

296
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,260
Community is here finding holes and bugs

297
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,820
and all kinds of problems in their uh

298
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,800
operating system and Microsoft start

299
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,839
this is how the conversation starts he

300
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:25,980
says we can and should discuss

301
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,540
vulnerabilities but we should be smart

302
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,000
prudent and responsible in the way we do

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
it and this responsible word I believe

304
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,260
might have been the first time

305
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,500
we heard about a something called

306
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,760
responsible disclosure

307
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,700
so that's the first thing this was a

308
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,380
Microsoft attempting to set the

309
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,079
conversation one and set the

310
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,540
conversation in a way where it's not our

311
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,779
fault it's those guys fault

312
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,600
and and and and this memo

313
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,420
set in train 10 years of some of the

314
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,820
most bitter fights and some of the most

315
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,180
anguish filled uh incidents in our in

316
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,480
our industry and to my to my benefit

317
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,459
gave me some of the greatest stories to

318
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,740
write as a journalist so for me I want

319
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,240
to thank Scott Culp for writing this

320
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,279
memo it really really started my career

321
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
in train

322
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,200
chapter two we move forward a little bit

323
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,760
to 2000. and Redmond has prior to this

324
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
this is before the days of blue hat

325
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
before the days of security conference

326
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,300
in the year 2000 Microsoft called up a

327
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,540
bunch of Who's Who of cyber security it

328
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,860
wasn't even cyber security at the time

329
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,660
it was infosec Microsoft called up or

330
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,459
who's who have been for SEC and brought

331
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,500
them to Redmond for an invite-only

332
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,139
safenet 2000 Summit this is because

333
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,060
they're they're dealing with they're

334
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,100
dealing with warm attacks they're

335
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,199
dealing with distrust in the operating

336
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,220
systems at scale that nobody uh imagines

337
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,860
and they have to take control of this

338
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,199
big customers are calling you can't even

339
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,480
keep Windows XP up or Windows 2000 up

340
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,100
for more than a minute before it goes

341
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,260
down it was really really bad at the

342
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,839
time in fact there were sometimes

343
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,699
how many folks in the audience here were

344
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:15,720
around in 2000 2001 2002.

345
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,880
oh good so there's a handful of it I

346
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,139
know I see the front benches there's a

347
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,399
handful of you folks who know what I'm

348
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,380
talking about but there was a guy at

349
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,000
Microsoft at a time named Dr Steve

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
lipner who was running security at the

351
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,440
time he decided that that this

352
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,420
responsible disclosure that Scott Culp

353
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,699
had just kind of set the stage for

354
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,160
they needed to bring industry Partners

355
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,100
in to validate and check markets so

356
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
we ended up at safe net 2000 policy and

357
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,199
practice in the internet age December

358
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,199
7th and 8th 2000 a handful of like

359
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,120
really really influential who's who of

360
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,300
cyber security landed at Redmond and uh

361
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,519
Dr lipner put these folks in a room to

362
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,420
Workshop the idea of disclosure and

363
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,100
responsibility because what was

364
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,720
happening at the time was

365
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,000
it's hot it's really really hard to put

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,699
into perspective what the landscape

367
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,220
looked like at the time today

368
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,139
patches are issued

369
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,660
automatic updates are there the patches

370
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,660
are applied nobody we kind of move on to

371
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,480
the next thing back then there was a

372
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,260
zero day drop

373
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,420
and we were all screwed and Microsoft

374
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,940
was scrambling to ship a patch

375
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,060
they didn't document anything properly

376
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,040
security researchers who would already

377
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,839
reverse engineer the patch would already

378
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,120
be publishing proof of Concepts exploit

379
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,459
code was everywhere and Microsoft was on

380
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,959
the back foot really really on the back

381
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,540
foot and quite frankly to be honest it

382
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,279
really needed to change it was too much

383
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,800
of a free-for-all it was too much chaos

384
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,199
and Computing could not move forward

385
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,699
right around the time we were creating

386
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,100
https we were going to drive Innovation

387
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,519
around e-commerce Amazon was created big

388
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,139
giant Industries was created on this

389
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,420
internet that was so fragile and we were

390
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,740
all running on Microsoft operating

391
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,040
systems and I'm the Microsoft

392
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,599
beat reporter who is tracking all these

393
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,859
things

394
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,959
So In fairness to Microsoft we really

395
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,699
needed to get control of this whole

396
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,880
responsible disclosure conversation but

397
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,220
they tried to do the old okie dokie

398
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,319
right they brought in a bunch of their

399
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,660
friendly companies put them in a room to

400
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,819
do a workshop and say let's come up with

401
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,419
let's come up with uh a consensus on

402
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,880
what is good is it 30 days is it 15 days

403
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,500
do we have to wait for a patch do we

404
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,240
have not have to wait for a patch so all

405
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,919
these these Consulting companies with

406
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,660
their hacker Crews and these who's who

407
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,000
this meeting had John Pescatore from

408
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,039
Gartner Ryan Russell some of the biggest

409
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,559
names at the time came in there and they

410
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,059
sat in this room and they tried to get

411
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,740
consensus tried to get consensus and

412
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,419
everyone's back slapping back slapping

413
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,580
each other and feeling like okay we're

414
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,559
in we're we're teamed together these

415
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,700
researchers are in the room with

416
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,960
Microsoft and we're trying to come up

417
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,539
with consensus for this thing

418
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,120
it turned out to be a big giant massive

419
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,460
PR exercise it turned out to be just

420
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,340
Microsoft purchasing time and purchasing

421
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,960
Goodwill from security researchers

422
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,299
because a year later these five

423
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,160
companies internet security systems

424
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,580
found Stone bind View Gardens and at

425
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,380
stake at stake is an interesting one but

426
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,260
at the time in November the following

427
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,600
year would come out and check mark on

428
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,760
blueprint Microsoft's version of what

429
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,520
the responsible disclosure

430
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,860
thing would look like

431
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,020
at stake specifically was an interesting

432
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,700
one because at stake was one of the

433
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,780
vendors who was part of this

434
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,240
free-for-all who were dropping tools and

435
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,220
dropping over days and dropping exploits

436
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,880
but when it came down to it we we in my

437
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,039
reporting back in 2000 and over the

438
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,559
years it turns out that Microsoft had

439
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,440
used the safe net 2000 Summit to bring

440
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,520
these consulting firms in and coerce

441
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,919
them

442
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,140
promised them

443
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,179
contracts here contracts there for

444
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,679
validation of what would become

445
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,299
Microsoft's version of responsible

446
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,799
disclosure Microsoft's version of

447
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,900
responsible disclosure was you report

448
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,520
the bug to me

449
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,340
you wait until I patch it

450
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,740
you wait an extra I believe it was 30

451
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,720
days before you could even discuss it

452
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,179
and proof of concept any sort of release

453
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,160
of proof of concept or exploit code that

454
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
validated it was irresponsible

455
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,240
completely irresponsible so this is what

456
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,100
a policy that came out of the safenet

457
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,879
thing was

458
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,460
and the reality at the time was

459
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,080
security researchers would report the

460
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,179
bug to Microsoft

461
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,620
and wait

462
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,940
and wait

463
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,160
and wait and then say hey are you guys

464
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
going to fix this thing it's like oh

465
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,380
yeah

466
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,179
next month and then they would wait

467
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,039
again and then they would wait again and

468
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,539
then these guys were creating their

469
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,039
black hat talks they were doing it for

470
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
notoriety for headlines they're doing

471
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,480
their black hot talks and they would

472
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,940
submit and wait and wait

473
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,980
and then we were just got freaking tired

474
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,600
of waiting they would drop a bug track

475
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,220
post and then Microsoft would start

476
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,780
yelling and screaming calling me the

477
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,179
journalists to say what the hell did

478
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,160
those guys do how dare they be that

479
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,720
irresponsible and I'm the journalist

480
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
writing stories it's security research

481
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,500
Community has been irresponsible again

482
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,900
dropping exploit for thing not knowing

483
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,120
that in the background it took months

484
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,580
and months and fights and bitter bitter

485
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,900
fights between these researchers and

486
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,080
these things so this was what's going on

487
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,700
quick question here for the folks in the

488
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,559
audience who do security research how

489
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,700
much in 2002 does it sound familiar like

490
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,500
you report a bug

491
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,900
you wait for the vendor to fix it you

492
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,660
wait you wait you wait and then you have

493
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,600
no option today there is no bug truck

494
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,160
and full disclosure

495
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,740
today there's bug bounties

496
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,020
and the bug bounties have emerged to be

497
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,940
the bribe Factor

498
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,620
to really really keep these things

499
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,960
private so when I eventually write my

500
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,299
book the safenet 2000 policy and

501
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,280
practice in the internet age the meeting

502
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,039
of December 7th and the use of these

503
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,600
companies and these things will become a

504
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,059
big big chapter because I feel like this

505
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,299
was the first time we realized that it

506
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,179
was not an honest effort it was not a

507
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,039
good fit effort on the on behalf on

508
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,380
Microsoft's part at coming up with with

509
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,940
consensus on what vulnerability

510
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,100
disclosure looked like it was

511
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,940
PR

512
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,159
and I I I I to this day I feel misled

513
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,500
and I feel used with a lot of the

514
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,120
articles I wrote about some of Youth

515
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,559
security research and some of you old

516
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,299
school folks in the audience so for that

517
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,500
you have my apology

518
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,360
once the safe net conference ended and

519
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,299
we Microsoft came to this consensus and

520
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,340
what responsible disclosure is

521
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,460
we fast forward to 2000.

522
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,179
and the famous Bill Gates trustworthy

523
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,159
Computing memo the trustworthy computer

524
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,220
and now looking back it's it it really

525
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,380
really starts to feel like it was a it

526
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,000
was it was like a deliberate thing right

527
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,280
the Scott cult memo comes along

528
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,500
sets up the doctor Steve lipner invite

529
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,360
only meeting that comes up with his fake

530
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,620
consensus

531
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,720
to the trustworthy Computing memo where

532
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,400
Bill Gates writes

533
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,799
that every week there are reports of

534
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,659
newly discovered security problems in

535
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,340
all kinds of softwares from Individual

536
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,020
applications and services and windows

537
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,580
and Linux and Unix and other platforms

538
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,520
we can and must do better this is the

539
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,620
Bill Gates famous memo

540
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,720
he promised that a new design approach

541
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,340
would need to dramatically reduce the

542
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,780
number of such issues that come up in

543
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,640
the software that Microsoft and its

544
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,260
Partners create we need to make it

545
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,419
automatic for customers to get a benefit

546
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,159
of these fixes and eventually our

547
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,900
software should be so fundamentally

548
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,299
secure that customers never worry about

549
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,559
it this is two thousand

550
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,419
I want to go back and read this one

551
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,460
every week there are reports of newly

552
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,440
discovered security problems in all

553
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,620
kinds of software this is 2002 this is

554
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,580
the year 2000.

555
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,559
if I put the year 2022 on the top right

556
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,140
of this screen here you would all be you

557
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,159
wouldn't know

558
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,700
right

559
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,620
at the time Bill Gates promised that the

560
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,880
software should be so fundamentally

561
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,620
secure the customers never even worry

562
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,260
about it tie this to

563
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,539
researchers are irresponsible everything

564
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,640
bad about Microsoft is because they are

565
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,200
irresponsible researchers telling you

566
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,720
about it we are over here fixing it

567
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
and here is where I want to pause get

568
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,000
off of my Microsoft hat and say

569
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,620
congratulations to Microsoft for really

570
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,860
really driving a lot of really solid

571
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,140
technical Innovation that has made

572
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,059
desktop Computing server Computing and

573
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,620
all of these things

574
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,840
uh really really strong and in in a

575
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,760
place where we can rely on it today

576
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,100
the trustworthy Computing memo gave us

577
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,159
XP Service Pack 2 that addressed Windows

578
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,260
worms it came with a firewall

579
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,299
uh it was the first time the desktop

580
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,980
operating system had a firewall turned

581
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,960
on by default really really really put a

582
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,659
crimp in Windows worms and moved and and

583
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,820
made desktop Computing something that we

584
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,280
could actually use and rely on Pops to

585
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,620
Microsoft for that we ended up with aslr

586
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,720
and depth and memory corruption

587
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,179
mitigations and roadblocks a lot of

588
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,120
solid solid Innovation there that moved

589
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,340
the needle

590
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,260
removed a whole bunch of script kitties

591
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,419
who were wreaking havoc on the operating

592
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,400
system and made it much much much more

593
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,320
difficult to exploit these operating

594
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,840
systems

595
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,780
another huge part of uh the trustworthy

596
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,580
Computing memo today we take it for

597
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,320
granted automatic updates every software

598
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,640
comes with automatic updates the

599
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,159
browsers patch themselves back then you

600
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,539
had to manually patch your machine

601
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,460
automatic updates and it was turned on

602
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,799
by default in XP Service Pack 2 into

603
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,659
Windows Vista and some of the other

604
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,299
memory mitigations things there and on

605
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,280
the policy side of things we got this

606
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,980
sdlc secure development life cycle and

607
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,659
threat modeling today you kids call it

608
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,840
shift left and whatever devops blah blah

609
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,580
you call it today but back then it was

610
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,140
threat modeling and sdlc that was

611
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,240
introduced by Microsoft and really

612
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,580
really took hold

613
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,200
we got a bunch of pre-patch security

614
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,140
advisories we got Patch Tuesday I don't

615
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,400
know if that's a good thing or a bad

616
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,039
thing I mean uh commiserations to you

617
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,840
who have to deal with past Tuesday but

618
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,080
we got a reliable

619
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,700
monthly Cadence when we could expect

620
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,279
patches Microsoft led the way with this

621
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,320
today Patch Tuesday is a normal thing

622
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,940
it's an accepted part of the industry

623
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,620
it's actually helping people to prepare

624
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,080
for deployment departures and all other

625
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,419
companies have copied Microsoft and done

626
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,400
the same thing we've got uh some other

627
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,640
programs like the Microsoft active

628
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,320
protections program map that provides

629
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,100
early notice of uh uh uh and Telemetry

630
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,520
for security vendors to react so

631
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,880
In fairness from 2000 despite the

632
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,100
shenanigans around responsive disclosure

633
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,779
In fairness Microsoft over the years

634
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,460
spent a lot of time doing really really

635
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,919
solid Innovation and got us to a place

636
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,860
where the trustworthy Computing memo I

637
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,740
would say by the Year

638
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,159
2005-2006 2007 had had delivered on its

639
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,020
promise for the most part are delivered

640
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,580
on his promise

641
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,159
but

642
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,700
it took a lot of fighting it took a lot

643
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,100
of folks and a lot of folks

644
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,620
in this room

645
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,080
to really hold Microsoft accountable

646
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,919
over those years and even from 2000 we

647
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,419
got the responsible disclosure we had

648
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,820
all these fights all the way to 2005

649
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,480
2006 2007 the whole notion of vendors

650
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,700
bashing researchers and vendors bashing

651
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,860
hackers for for for for disclosure

652
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,840
issues

653
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,600
continue to be a big problem in chapter

654
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,120
four I want to move to

655
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,120
ms05009 anyone recognize this bug one

656
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,919
person in the room two people in the

657
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,779
room of course recognize

658
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,520
you got a guy in the corner there with

659
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,860
an ms0509

660
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,559
was the first time I had ever seen a

661
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,020
remote zero they click exploit that

662
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,960
popped a machine without a user doing

663
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
anything whatsoever

664
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,539
and to set the stage without to telling

665
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,520
the story I got to tell you what desktop

666
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Communications look like at the time

667
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,919
people who use AOL Messenger

668
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,559
she's one of us

669
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,158
so freaking old

670
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,980
AOL and MSN Messenger were two desktop

671
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,380
IM applications at the time that we all

672
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,900
needed that I was writing stories about

673
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,520
interoperability the lack of

674
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,380
interoperability you needed the AOL and

675
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,059
you needed IMO we were always fighting

676
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,500
for them to start talking to each other

677
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,600
this is long before your kids had your

678
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,480
Tiki Takis and and Twitter and Instagram

679
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,220
and Facebook and all these communication

680
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,799
platforms but then you needed AOL I am

681
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,480
on your on your desktop and you needed

682
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,840
an MSN MSN was the cold one because MSN

683
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,520
gave you a body list you could set cool

684
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,919
away messages you can set profile

685
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,200
pictures like profile pictures was a big

686
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,700
thing at the time we were just so

687
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,320
freaking excited we could change profile

688
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,179
pictures by the week like this is what

689
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,559
old people did back then

690
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,480
sometimes I don't know the dates because

691
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,279
no one knows the dates but sometime

692
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,460
around 2004 I want to say 2003 and just

693
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,720
because I know this that happened

694
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,460
at Microsoft at the time it might have

695
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,240
been 2002. core security a small company

696
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,179
located right here in Argentina reported

697
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,000
MSM reported a vulnerability in PNG

698
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,039
processing that could allow remote code

699
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,279
execution I said 2003 2004 it might have

700
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,960
been reported then because nobody knows

701
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,340
nobody was documenting things

702
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,299
foreign

703
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,700
was a very very bad bug Microsoft

704
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,779
patched it in February 08 2005.

705
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,900
I was at my desk in a building in New

706
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,940
York City when uh

707
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,620
an exploit landed on bug track it was

708
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,299
the day that Microsoft patched this it

709
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,940
might have been February 8 2005 and an

710
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,279
exploit a core security released an

711
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,080
exploit code

712
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,020
for this PNG processing vulnerability

713
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,380
it was really really really bad

714
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,720
let me go back for a second it was

715
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,419
really really bad right I mentioned MSN

716
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,039
Messenger had this profile picture thing

717
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,980
this bug was so bad that that the

718
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,000
attacker

719
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,940
could manipulate the his body list

720
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,799
correct me if I'm wrong for the folks

721
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,679
who know it attacker could manipulate

722
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,360
the image in his body list and

723
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,940
compromise your list and then turn it

724
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,100
into a worm to compromise folks

725
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,899
throughout the system it was a one of

726
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,520
those really really really zero click

727
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,659
bugs and when I say it was the first

728
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,940
time I'd ever seen one it literally like

729
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,559
swing buddy list was here and then calc

730
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,779
was popping and there was no clicking

731
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,159
there was no nothing and the guys were

732
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,720
showing me this exploit right it was

733
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,580
really really bad

734
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,340
when Microsoft patched it again going

735
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,700
back to to the period the patch would be

736
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,140
issued

737
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,360
vendors would test and test and people

738
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,860
would eventually get around to patching

739
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,539
it but over that time people were

740
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,279
reversing those patches very very

741
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,779
quickly attackers were reversing those

742
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,220
patches very very quickly much like

743
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,539
today

744
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,460
and getting their own exploits so core

745
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,399
because it was so bad core decided

746
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,200
listen guys this is really really bad

747
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,279
we're going to put out the proof of

748
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,980
concept actually just to prove it

749
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,919
Microsoft was pissed

750
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,380
I got a call from step two

751
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,960
rip the great step Stephen Toulouse from

752
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,059
Microsoft at the time saying Ryan are

753
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,260
you going to write about this score guys

754
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,460
are you going to write about this

755
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,960
nonsense and Discord Guys these guys

756
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,640
literally released an exploit for

757
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,380
something that could cause debilitating

758
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,179
damage across the industry

759
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,120
and I said to step two guys

760
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,039
these guys reported this back to you

761
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,620
these guys gave this to you you had time

762
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,380
to fix it you have to fix it uh you'll

763
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,940
fix it why are you still fighting with

764
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,620
these guys is there a possibility that

765
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,299
we could push this as a mandatory update

766
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,679
I remember having this conversation with

767
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,539
him why isn't this a monetary update if

768
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,760
it's so bad and you guys turns out

769
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,880
Microsoft a week later released uh made

770
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,799
of an operational switch to MSN

771
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,899
Messenger that

772
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,940
made the fixed mandatory you could not

773
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,640
log into MSN Messenger anymore unless

774
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,279
you had applied the patch but again

775
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,320
using the vessel of me as a security

776
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,120
researcher Microsoft calls and starts

777
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,740
yelling lashing out to two companies I

778
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,720
believe Finnegan software at the time

779
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,539
was was related to something else that

780
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,039
had that had published proof of concept

781
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,880
code but core and my friend Max casares

782
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,299
took a lot of heat

783
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:59,700
for releasing the exploit and pushing

784
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,500
this thing forward and at the time I

785
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,899
wrote about this and I was like

786
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,600
you know struggling between how bad is

787
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,918
it we need to get it fixed and

788
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,860
and here we are with Microsoft pinning

789
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,140
the blame for exploit code squarely on

790
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,480
the shoulders of core security the

791
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,279
publishing of uh proof of concept code

792
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,899
within hours of the security updates

793
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,880
being made has put customers at the

794
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,880
extra at the increased risk right

795
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,039
they created a special MSN Messenger

796
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,440
page there was like a whole thing it was

797
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,140
like a whole process

798
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,760
what I didn't know about the recipe

799
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,620
industry didn't know was that core had

800
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,539
reported about the Microsoft for a long

801
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:40,320
time

802
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,320
they knew how bad it was they sat on it

803
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,520
and the fix took

804
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,159
several several months like this is like

805
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,440
again we find out later on how bad the

806
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,840
bug was it literally was the first

807
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,760
before natashank and all these folks are

808
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,380
doing zero click stuff this these guys

809
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,919
were doing this stuff back in 2005 right

810
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,899
so for months and months they had sat on

811
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,399
it core had said hey you guys are going

812
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:06,659
to fix it they had been pushed off again

813
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:07,919
hey you guys gonna think they've been

814
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,659
pushed off again then the fix finally

815
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,640
comes courtships the exploit core gets

816
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,460
blamed and I realized wait a second this

817
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,559
isn't right this isn't right

818
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,720
and I command core for releasing that

819
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,419
exploit I command core for pushing the

820
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,159
needle forward and holding them

821
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,019
accountable in ways

822
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:29,059
that really really

823
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,100
set the stage for everything we we've

824
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,960
seen later on

825
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,200
and the the tail end to this chapter is

826
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
because of what happened with Microsoft

827
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,620
and because of all that nonsense core

828
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,299
decided that they were going to be the

829
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,580
masters of the timeline they were going

830
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,260
to document from the time they reported

831
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,480
the bug to the time the patch was

832
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,279
shipped and they shipped their exploits

833
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,100
this massive page introducing this one

834
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,539
page of like

835
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,360
inches and inches and pages and pages of

836
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,980
documentation we reported about the

837
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,500
Microsoft Microsoft accepted Microsoft

838
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,480
does not release this is a fix

839
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,159
we believe it's a fix we send them

840
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,418
exploit code they couldn't get the

841
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,040
exploit code to work we send them a tool

842
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,418
to help them get the exploit code to

843
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,159
work we send it and and there's

844
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,599
disclosure and these are some examples

845
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,879
of some of the funnier ones

846
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,580
whoever's responsible for the advisories

847
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,500
page at court today please get it fixed

848
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,199
if you've ruined what has been a

849
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,820
beautiful historical part of cyber

850
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,619
security where we could find these

851
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,960
really really really for the first time

852
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,119
core gave us a night an eye wall into

853
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,099
what was happening all those years when

854
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,139
you report the bug and you wait for a

855
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,879
fix and you wait for a fix and they said

856
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,879
I will fix it eventually

857
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,800
so I want to pay a tribute to the folks

858
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,839
from core if if anyone recognize

859
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,379
themselves in this picture please stand

860
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,839
I said

861
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,339
we have one guy here

862
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,599
and I put this picture up here because

863
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,220
let me tell you something

864
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,440
these guys were way way ahead of their

865
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,680
time these guys back in the late 1990s

866
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,960
and early 2000s they were building

867
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,460
things

868
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,800
that we take for granted today they were

869
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,960
building the first first attack service

870
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,940
management tools today there are

871
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,320
hundreds of hundreds of millions of

872
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,359
dollars in Israeli companies invested

873
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,099
into a tax office management and red

874
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,200
teaming and penetration testing These

875
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,700
Guys these guys right in this room and

876
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,040
these guys in an office

877
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
10 minutes from here 15 minutes from

878
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,180
here in Palermo I was building the roots

879
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,760
of penetration testing they were really

880
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
they were holding Microsoft accountable

881
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,740
they did it with great bravery they did

882
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,500
it at Great cost Microsoft would

883
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,680
eventually nudge core out of all those

884
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,660
contracts that went to Iowa active and

885
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,579
Leviathan and all those U.S companies

886
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,380
and they did a

887
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,440
great

888
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,240
bravery and at Great cost so I want

889
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,400
again a round of applause for the folks

890
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,060
at core security

891
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,380
for holding the fort

892
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,900
and pushing us forward

893
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,820
famous score security shirt as well

894
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,560
we're always there for you the top 10

895
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,540
reasons Microsoft is not like your ex

896
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,859
another quick quick story I'll run

897
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,180
through here is this two-year-old

898
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,540
Colonel bug the emergency ms017 patch

899
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,460
anyone recognize this one nobody here

900
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,099
recognize yep one two yeah who is this

901
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,780
guy this guy knows everything we gotta

902
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,380
talk afterwards

903
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,240
I talk about I talked about what

904
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,460
disclosure looked like in 2000 and now

905
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,619
we're all the way to 2006 six years

906
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,980
after Bill Gates's memo six years later

907
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,020
we're still fighting we're still

908
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,520
fighting about vulnerabilities and

909
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,619
Microsoft and vendors approach to fixing

910
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,200
things so we move forward to 2006 and a

911
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,960
big ex this is what was a big big part

912
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,520
of my life and reporting over the years

913
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,720
was the month of bugs every month every

914
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,300
day for an entire month for 30 days guys

915
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,099
would release exploit code and proof of

916
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,619
Concepts targeting specific things so in

917
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:10,020
July 2006 HD more launched month of

918
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,000
browser bugs it was a lot of proof of

919
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,460
concept code for Flaws in IE Firefox

920
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,220
Safari Opera conqueror Chrome didn't

921
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,680
exist at the time but when I say proof

922
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,500
of concept code and releases every

923
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,780
single one of these were things that had

924
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,060
been reported to the vendor had been

925
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,180
ignored and ignored and pushed back and

926
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,500
pushed back so these guys were just like

927
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,480
listen I got a lot about all these bugs

928
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,619
and proof of Concepts sitting around

929
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,599
I'll just go and throw them up 30 days

930
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,339
we'll get some headlines and I'm the

931
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,260
security journalist and I'm like okay we

932
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,300
get stories to write let's go so we I

933
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,859
was covering these things on a daily

934
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,560
basis hdmr did a month of browser bugs

935
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,380
in July November uh element and some

936
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,780
guys did I think Kevin finister was

937
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,400
involved with this one the month of

938
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,619
Colonel bugs December we saw the month

939
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,920
of Apple bugs uh March it became under

940
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,640
PHP bugs and by the late 2007 it started

941
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,200
to fizzle out we had Twitter month of

942
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,820
Twitter bugs and month of Facebook bugs

943
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,380
and all of that but the one I want to

944
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,140
focus on is the month of Colonel bugs

945
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,180
the month of carnal bugs in November

946
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,720
2006 gave us

947
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,119
mlkb0611 2006 a Windows kernel GDI local

948
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,579
privilege escalation bug

949
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,560
you see the note at the bottom

950
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,420
this was reported to Microsoft on

951
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,660
October 22 2004.

952
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,820
vulnerability in the handling GDI kernel

953
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,980
structures that leads to an exploitable

954
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,660
memory corruption condition caused in

955
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,000
DOS or arbitrary code execution and

956
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,859
successful components

957
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,079
again the guy on the right here say

958
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,480
sarsarudo an Argentinian Haku you should

959
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,760
all know had reported this to Microsoft

960
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,280
in October 2004 and the response was meh

961
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,859
the response was we'll fix that in the

962
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,359
service back

963
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,640
the response was stop bothering us with

964
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,540
this bug

965
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,940
real real story

966
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,700
so in 2004 he reports it he keeps

967
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,140
checking with Microsoft and the usual

968
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,940
happens we'll fix it eventually we'll

969
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,619
fix it eventually it's not a thing it's

970
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,300
not it's not there's no code execution

971
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,220
risk it's a small dusting we'll fix it

972
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,780
in a service pack we'll fix it in a

973
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,180
service pack so

974
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,540
2006 comes along month of corner bugs is

975
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,240
happening and Cesar says hey I got one

976
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,680
here these guys aren't going to fix it

977
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,420
here let me throw it over the wall so he

978
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,560
throws it over the wall and the guys

979
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,420
published a proof of concept and as part

980
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,640
of this month of Kernel box it's a small

981
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,680
tiny thing it was one of 30 bucks it was

982
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,560
like a small tiny thing

983
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,960
fast forward a few months

984
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,640
fast forward a few months to get the

985
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,680
black hat Europe in Amsterdam and

986
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,359
there's a bunch of European hackers who

987
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,280
took this month of browser bugs staying

988
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,380
Fung by Cesar saruto Joelle Erickson was

989
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,300
the guy as well who took that Windows

990
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,900
2000 XP bug that Cesar reported in 2004.

991
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,460
they were going to eventually fix in a

992
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,599
strawberry spark at least that was the

993
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,680
promise

994
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,480
and he turned it into an actual remote

995
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,940
code execution exploit fitted it into I

996
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,540
believe it was immunity

997
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,480
I believe it was immunity canvas it was

998
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,460
sole interview campus and then suddenly

999
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,140
this 2004

1000
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,740
GDI bug that that Cesar reported is now

1001
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,380
in a functional exploit pack used by

1002
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,420
like

1003
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,180
use it was supposedly used for a lot of

1004
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,280
pen testing and red teaming exercise but

1005
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,079
now it's in the hands of

1006
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,820
you know the places that those guys sold

1007
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,300
stuff to

1008
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,260
but

1009
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,880
the story doesn't end here with that

1010
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,859
without exploit we move we fast forward

1011
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:40,200
two years later Microsoft drops an

1012
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,720
emergency patch MSO 7017 it's super

1013
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,500
critical April 3rd 2007. and I was like

1014
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,800
wait a second this is cesarsberg

1015
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,839
this doesn't make any sense at all like

1016
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,700
why is this a freaking emergency patch

1017
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,619
there was an animated cursor issue at

1018
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,240
the time that was causing some Havoc but

1019
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,560
what it did

1020
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,040
because because Cesar put it into Mount

1021
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,440
about the bugs and because Joel fitted

1022
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,880
it into an exploit uh platform

1023
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,099
ms07017 fixes csr's bug in a very very

1024
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,200
critical allow remote code execution

1025
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,400
emergency out of band update in April 3

1026
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,079
2007. so I called Microsoft

1027
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,960
it's like what the like why is it

1028
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,760
how is this an emergency patch when you

1029
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,320
just you were just telling me during the

1030
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,000
month of month of carnal bugs I had

1031
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,859
written about it and I had said this was

1032
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,380
reported a long time ago how why is this

1033
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,300
an emergency fix and it's like well

1034
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,619
Cesar was irresponsible

1035
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,240
true story

1036
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,520
so I wrote this story one of my and I

1037
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,980
shared this because if anyone asked me

1038
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,180
what was your favorite story to write

1039
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,680
over the years it was this one because

1040
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,079
it was really really a microcosm of what

1041
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,940
things look like at the time you would

1042
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,740
get a bug the vendor would just do

1043
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,780
whatever they wanted and then paint the

1044
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,220
researcher with the responsible

1045
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,839
disclosure bug

1046
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,780
so I wrote I wrote this story it gave me

1047
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,060
some of my most famous quotes we don't

1048
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,099
credit researchers who participate in

1049
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,200
full disclosure Millers declared

1050
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,820
shocking of that stance to a rigid

1051
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,619
policy to encourage the concept of

1052
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:12,900
responsible disclosure keep in mind

1053
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,820
again this is a bug that was given to

1054
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,180
them in 2004 two years later they are

1055
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,560
accusing this guy of irresponsible

1056
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,839
disclosure because they didn't patch it

1057
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,060
on time it was unacceptable and my

1058
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,220
favorite quote was Andrew Cushman who

1059
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,079
I'm sure a lot of you know he says I

1060
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,220
hope you don't write that we were

1061
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,900
twiddling our thumbs doing nothing for

1062
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,700
two years and I was so happy he gave me

1063
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,079
that quote because he gave me a chance

1064
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,240
to write exactly that that they were

1065
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,099
twiddling their thumbs and they wouldn't

1066
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,619
do anything until there was risk and

1067
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,780
that brings me to the point of these

1068
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,400
vendors are only going to be held

1069
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,480
accountable

1070
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,400
until you hold them to the fire

1071
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:53,339
fast forward quickly to the Pontoon and

1072
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,380
when bug bounties became the actual bug

1073
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,020
bug bounties became hush money and

1074
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,760
warped Financial incentives I talk about

1075
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,680
holding people to the fire

1076
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,240
holding people to the fire holding

1077
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,640
Microsoft to the fire

1078
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,460
full disclosure and the ability to go to

1079
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,200
the public and say hey I gave this to

1080
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,640
Microsoft two years ago and they're not

1081
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,740
going to fix it was what gave us that

1082
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,780
emergency fix that was one example of

1083
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,400
thousands that was happening at a time

1084
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,839
these stories I'm telling you these are

1085
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,480
not big big stories these are just tiny

1086
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,240
little stories that I was a part of but

1087
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,099
this is what it looked like all the way

1088
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,020
at the time

1089
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,460
how many people have seen this photo

1090
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,819
before from cancer quest in 2010. this

1091
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,180
is 10 years after the the again 10 years

1092
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,000
after the the Scott Culp

1093
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,819
safenet 2000 trustworthy Computing memo

1094
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,099
Dino daisovi and Alex arturov gets on

1095
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,380
the stage at cansec West Charlie Miller

1096
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,319
is on the microphone saying it's enough

1097
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:50,520
guys

1098
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,260
these guys are treating us like

1099
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,480
we're giving them free bugs we're giving

1100
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,460
them free QA we're reporting all these

1101
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,560
vulnerabilities to them no more free

1102
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,560
bugs stop stop reporting bugs to vendors

1103
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,359
make sure they pay you if you don't get

1104
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,680
paid if you're not compensated

1105
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,599
we're not going to play

1106
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,760
again big story for me I wrote at the

1107
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,319
time researchers are fighting black blah

1108
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,780
blah blah blah Dave Goldsmith from

1109
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,400
matasano at the time pulled me in a

1110
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,280
corner at RSC same here and said be

1111
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,560
careful what you wish for be careful

1112
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,540
what you wish for with this no more free

1113
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,819
bugs because what has what will

1114
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,400
happen is the vendors

1115
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,920
are the the the the power that you have

1116
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,200
will eventually shift the vendors and I

1117
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,640
remember looking at Dave Goldsmith and

1118
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,540
saying

1119
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,000
and he used to say you know these bugs

1120
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,280
are not free there are there already are

1121
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,079
no free bugs it costs these vendors a

1122
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,359
lot to deal with it and so on

1123
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,220
and I tell you Dave Goldsmith was right

1124
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,440
well that push for vendors to start

1125
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,760
paying and start compensating

1126
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,520
researchers created a startup ecosystem

1127
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:01,020
and an entire ecosystem of hush money

1128
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,579
bribery

1129
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,740
Venture Capital startups abusing

1130
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,540
security researchers

1131
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,060
the on the screen right now you're

1132
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,460
looking at three unprofitable late stage

1133
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,980
series D series e-startups that have

1134
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,000
raised 159 million 78 million and 107

1135
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,040
million dollars

1136
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,140
I don't know if you know how VC works

1137
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,380
but VC and and

1138
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,980
the drive in the business World requires

1139
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,839
growth everything needs to be growth if

1140
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,839
Haka one is not growing

1141
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,380
they're losing

1142
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,040
and in a what what what did no more free

1143
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,980
bugs Pawn to own payers pay researchers

1144
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,260
pay researchers created this ecosystem

1145
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,119
where it's not all bad how many people

1146
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,680
here play bug bounties and make a lot of

1147
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,780
money from bug bounties shout out to you

1148
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,000
guys it's not all bad bug bounties have

1149
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,640
created uh earning power and essential

1150
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,140
earning power for a lot of people all

1151
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,300
over the world in India in China and all

1152
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,940
the parts of the world

1153
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,800
but the downside and the dark pattern

1154
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,900
here is that it's removed the power from

1155
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,760
the research Community it's removed that

1156
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,540
kind of hold them to the fire

1157
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,880
it's it's it's gotten us to a place

1158
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,160
where these are starting to Bubble Up

1159
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,319
where security researchers are starting

1160
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,540
to rant about how these programs are set

1161
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,060
up to abuse researchers these programs

1162
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,160
are set up for vendors to get the upper

1163
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,040
hand and spend money to keep you quiet

1164
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,859
bugs that are reported in 2004 that gets

1165
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:34,020
fixed in 2006 and vendors are fighting

1166
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,880
about this exists today

1167
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,280
except that no one is there to fight it

1168
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,680
and they say sorts of rulers and the

1169
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,380
core security have all been consumed in

1170
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,359
this bug Bounty world because they need

1171
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,819
to earn and they need to get paid and we

1172
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:51,540
have no way to do the necessary fight

1173
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,579
back so to close out I want to talk a

1174
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,020
little bit about some of some of these

1175
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,700
dark patterns that keep emerging every

1176
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,980
year the vendor that I talked about that

1177
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,680
was my beat is now a 15 billion dollar

1178
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,420
cyber security vendor you know what that

1179
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,460
means that next year they need to be a

1180
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,740
16 billion dollar cyber security vendor

1181
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,420
you know what I mean that the following

1182
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,220
year they need to be a 17 billion dollar

1183
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,079
cyber security vendor because the minute

1184
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,180
Satya Nadella decided to break out cyber

1185
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,859
security revenues

1186
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,500
he made it clear that cyber security is

1187
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,440
very very big business we are here too

1188
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,079
squeeze every dollar out of it the stock

1189
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,940
market will depend will rely on us

1190
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,220
growing year over year and when these

1191
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,079
kinds of incentives have shifted in so

1192
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,640
much where Microsoft needs to grow

1193
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,280
security gets hit and security takes a

1194
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,640
backseat and security starts to suffer

1195
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,520
I'll use one small example here and and

1196
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,740
this is a small one microsoft.com

1197
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,619
security microsoft.com security for many

1198
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:48,900
many years all these years used to look

1199
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,700
like this this is an old screenshot it's

1200
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,380
been adopted over the years but it

1201
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,660
literally was microsoft.com security was

1202
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,300
a place you could go to find information

1203
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,079
on where you can apply the patch it Pros

1204
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,300
got infrastructure threat modeling guide

1205
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,640
it literally was a portal for you to go

1206
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,220
find security response real genuine

1207
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,319
information I'm not going to show you

1208
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,460
what it looks like today I'm going to

1209
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,980
encourage you guys to go to

1210
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,300
microsoftsecurity.com today when you go

1211
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,040
there today there is no information

1212
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,839
whatsoever on security research

1213
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,339
vulnerabilities there's no information

1214
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,740
whatsoever on response instead you get

1215
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,740
three buttons home business and

1216
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,420
Enterprise when you click on either

1217
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,160
those buttons they ask you for your

1218
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,260
credit card this is what microsoft.com

1219
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,079
security looks like today it's now a

1220
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,060
page to sell their software and to

1221
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,619
become a 15 billion dollars a year

1222
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,160
vendor in a world run by Bob bounties

1223
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,220
where we we have no way of doing this

1224
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,200
fight back so this is a dark pattern

1225
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,280
that I think you should really really

1226
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,839
pay attention to and if you work at

1227
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,780
Microsoft I just beg you can we get back

1228
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,220
a little section of microsoft.com

1229
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,940
security just so we can get some

1230
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,099
in actual information not you trying to

1231
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,560
sell us something

1232
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,200
you cannot be a 15 if you are a 15

1233
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,660
billion dollars a year vendor that needs

1234
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,619
to

1235
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:10,319
be a 17 billion dollar a year vendor in

1236
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,540
two years you have a higher level of

1237
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,940
responsibility to your users and you

1238
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,640
cannot

1239
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,079
be claiming to be a cyber security

1240
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,260
leader and you cannot claim to be

1241
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,079
in control of things when these are the

1242
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:27,540
dominant headlines of the day the the

1243
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,819
screenshots on your screen is a

1244
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:32,339
Wikipedia page for Prince Nightmare and

1245
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,079
they shoot at Microsoft struggles to

1246
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,460
patch they've tried to patch it they

1247
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,560
keep batching the patches they batch

1248
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,500
patches on Microsoft Exchange Server

1249
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,980
uh they've we're left in a world where

1250
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,380
everything is duct taped and and bottle

1251
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,180
waxed

1252
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,000
into complexity and Legacy code left

1253
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,560
over we are building we're we're

1254
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,540
producing and pushing out more code than

1255
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,760
we can realistically secure we're in

1256
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,599
2022 and the security vendors who are

1257
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,339
two minutes yeah I've seen the timer

1258
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:03,960
here I got two minutes

1259
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,040
don't make me panic

1260
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:10,260
we have a 15 billion dollars a year

1261
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,819
vendor who's struggling to patch their

1262
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:12,839
software

1263
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,240
dealing with a zero day epidemic

1264
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,480
and and and and and driving us to just

1265
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,760
uh keep buying their software

1266
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,000
I took the screenshot October 2022. I

1267
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,260
want you to read it carefully and tell

1268
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,880
me if this doesn't read like exactly

1269
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,359
like the ones I showed you from 2000

1270
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:33,119
Microsoft just had a misconfigured

1271
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,700
Microsoft storage location issue and the

1272
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,560
stock radar company that reported it

1273
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,480
published some stuff they made some

1274
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,880
mistakes yes here and there but the

1275
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,560
language from Microsoft really really

1276
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,839
irks me

1277
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,400
okay bro

1278
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,420
keep going man you're good

1279
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,740
dude that's a bad fault you're

1280
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,540
good very good keep going

1281
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,420
sorry guys

1282
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,000
the point I want to make is that in 2020

1283
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,400
in 2022 the languages are exactly the

1284
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,440
same Microsoft is beating up and pushing

1285
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,680
and and and and and and and and uh

1286
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,540
vilifying the people who are actually

1287
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,859
reporting the things to them

1288
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,119
2022

1289
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,940
this is a LinkedIn post from tenable CEO

1290
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,640
Amity Iran again a lot of the things

1291
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,819
that we see today are the same things

1292
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,280
that are reported in 2022. it's starting

1293
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,040
to feel very very much like 2001 all

1294
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,020
over again it's starting to feel very

1295
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,859
much like when when when when when when

1296
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:42,480
we were inundated with warm attacks and

1297
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,520
things felt unbearable

1298
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,559
the same things for csos today they're

1299
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,780
inundated it ransomware attacks and and

1300
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,000
supply chain issues and all kinds of

1301
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,740
things that feels unbearable

1302
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,619
like I just showed you responsible

1303
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,880
disclosure still a nightmare and it's a

1304
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,099
nightmare only for researchers we're in

1305
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,780
a world where in the wild odd attacks

1306
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,040
are escalating I don't know if you guys

1307
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,960
have looked but last year we had 84

1308
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,000
documented in the wild attacks those are

1309
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,440
the ones that we know about it's

1310
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,819
probably a thousand that we don't know

1311
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:10,020
about but the ones that we know about

1312
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,839
they were 84 last year and I think we're

1313
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,240
up to 40 this year of actual

1314
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,220
vulnerabilities that have been exploited

1315
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,720
in a while before the vendors even

1316
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,460
gotten a chance to even see it or create

1317
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,020
a patch

1318
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,119
we are inundated with supply chain

1319
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,220
compromises vendors fighting with

1320
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,680
researchers have you ever gone to try to

1321
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,839
look at one of Microsoft's uh bulletins

1322
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,420
today where in the past we used to hear

1323
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,099
this it's now a blank screen it

1324
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,500
literally is there's a bug these things

1325
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,780
are affected fix it nobody knows what's

1326
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,940
across it's just a complete and utter

1327
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,220
nightmare we've gone backwards Microsoft

1328
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,040
has given up all those gains

1329
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,859
and here we are in 2022 and I'm writing

1330
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:53,280
the same freaking stories all over again

1331
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,740
I want to make one last point the stakes

1332
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,420
are very very high

1333
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,559
the power rests with us to fix it it's a

1334
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:03,119
very very hard problem to fix the bug

1335
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,819
bounties and the bug Bounty markets have

1336
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:08,960
really screwed things up

1337
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,400
there's room for Innovation there's room

1338
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,140
for

1339
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,020
uh there's room for

1340
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,359
they said innovate or die there's room

1341
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,819
for us to fix this it starts here in

1342
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:22,500
this room it starts with the next

1343
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,180
generation of folks the gray bear
