Well, we welcome you to the first talk of the day Daniel Alberto Gil [Applause] Hello, good morning, how are you? I'm here to talk to you about a topic that you probably don't hear a lot about at a security conference, and these are things that really happen in someone's life.  that is in the world of this industry of this industry but they don't talk about there are many things that they don't really teach us at university what they do teach us is that we have to act ethically at all times But sometimes we do things that we are convinced  what are the things we should do the right thing and the results are not what we expected and nothing and we wonder what happened and well that's my story basically and I'm going to start with a little video the computer system of the Catholic circle mutualist reported  an alert of attempted attack on your server everything that was reported to the full authorities when the world of computing was interested in p  but I didn't have the ability to break a system you didn't pay me and that's good Because it helps us not much it has helped a lot hackers it has helped a lot to internet freedom it has helped a lot [Music] February 31 of this year that the computer system of the  Mutualist Círculo Católica reported an alert of an attempted attack on its server, all of which was reported to the competent authorities a week later, on February 8, the mutualist received an email containing threats to disclose confidential information from members' medical records  with HIV positive through social networks and the press and that to avoid this the institution would pay a certain amount of bitcoin a currency for visual use the man who distorts a mutual is 41 years old and is a computer engineer as well as an expert in computer security justice los  processes were a crime of fraudulent knowledge of secret documents with a crime of e  Attempted xtortion It should be noted that it is the first time that a case of extortion with virtual currency has come to light. Well, that person who was prosecuted with prison was I, I did not expect it. It all started in 2014, my ex-partner was a partner or is  member of that health service provider and one day in October 2014 when she was at home she told me you dare to enter the page of the mutualist and reserve the time with a specialist I do not remember what and nothing gives me the address I enter the  page and it tells me I give you the username and password and I say no no no it's not necessary I'm already inside it says what no I'm already inside and as an administrator sorry yes How did you not put admin the user and admin in password and he teeth and  I had administrator permission Ok Oh God 200,000 medical records were not only in the systems but also the patient's records but also the mutualist's financial information and information on the stock of medicines, everything that  Whatever you want from the motorcyclist, you could have full access. I mean, I was screwed, it was a red flag, an alarm, something had to be done, that is, and what I did was what I normally do.  see saying ok I accessed this system Felipe tell you experiential and I was able to enter as administrator it was a Saturday it was a Saturday which is interesting because in less than an hour the director of the being responded to me confirming that the report was correct he had confirmed that what  It said This was like that and nothing had ever been reported, although a lot of things were reported from other places, such a quick response and I don't remember ever receiving a response like that, therefore it is once I did this and received that response, it was no longer  Luckily my problem Because they were a problem, they had to [ __ ] themselves to solve them, that is, when an incident report is made, one does not have to receive any type of explanation and continue  When nothing happens, you simply report it and it is forgotten in Uruguay. In addition, there are no pogbanti programs and I hope they thank you. In other words, if you do it, simply because helping someone and it seems to you that it is what you have to do, more than anything, it is always  due to the fact that you think you discovered it Ok you report it otherwise someone is going to discover it after you and that person does not know what they are going to do with it So I think that is the main the main motivation for which Someone does that like how  I do it in a simple way constantly because well and well precisely on this server that server of this health service provider I was not there I was not part of that server In other words, it did not influence me at all In other words, report it no no  Life affected me not at all but I still couldn't do nothing Ok but I forgot that happened April 2014, 2015 my my partner tells me Alberto you can enter the medical service for I don't know what and I don't  I learn more I told him Well it's fine that time central medical services and this time it was even worse in 10 minutes or so I can realize that I could access all the medical records of all the patients again But this time it was a little worse  I did not need a username or password, I simply had to Modify a parameter of a URL and browse through all the patient records, just imagine if someone had created a txt with all those modified URLs and sent it to Google, it would have been indexed by Google  then they could have put the names of the people and the clinical history would really come out Wow No, it didn't have anything good but it doesn't teach anything here either Ok what do I do again jump steals be. uy Eh I want to report this problem bla bla bla always saying I connected from  this IP to this happened this seems to me to be a little problem nothing and luckily a response with the number of tickets for follow-up and C  hau bye same my problem Ok I forgot that and I learned and learned and never again did he tell me that if I could Access the medical site to do some kind of procedure I did not do it again OK until 2016 until December that I have to admit that I am guilty  in that year in that in the month of December she asked me for a certificate to be able to donate blood about she needed a result of a clinical examination and well she was in the interior of Uruguay in a place where she had little connectivity and well she is between something about  the system and I realized that the queries were limited to a maximum range of three months per specific query of this particular type and I had to search since 2009, that is, Ok, everything is fine, but I have to search for three months, no, this is it and one comes out  little thing on the client side take a little control and suddenly I did a search of 9 years instead of three months and suddenly the server went down yes I am guilty but it was not with evil and nothing happened or  Either after a few hours the server got up and well if that is a crime I am guilty of that I did it but it was not any bad intention Simply because I am not going to be looking for that three months of something that is going to help me a lot of the time simply  I refuse to do it huh And well Then a day happened in September in September Well I'm going to skip all this because it's irrelevant I already told you a lot of things one day in September 2017 well here I show you basically Those are the means that I sent to be  says company circle catholics without the need for users and passwords by modifying the parameters of bla bla bla you can access that they criticize you numbert September 2 is this image that you are going to see It is the first time that the one that I share it has never done it before And  This is the day after my ex-partner's birthday, which was the first of September and nothing. We went to fight for her to spend a day at the beach and this was the last time I was  with her and nothing causes me many memories and well that was a Saturday and February 9, September was the following Saturday where some things happened For example that Saturday is happening in Uruguay the vice president has submitted his resignation as confirmed through  from his Twitter account we also present part of this message from Raúl's account Ok that day the vice president of Uruguay resigned for the first time that this happened to our country and on this day I also don't believe in conspiracies or anything like that it's [ __ ] Sorry for  the expression but that same day I was also arrested by Interpol And that week I think I had more time in the press or the press dedicated more to the case related to the hack than to the resignation of the vice president of Uruguay it was quite curious the synchronicity was  It is also interesting the person who triggered this whole process in which the resignation of the vice president of the journalist Patricia Ma  drid then the first person who interviewed me in the peach prison left, with which there are many many many many coincidences. Nothing they arrested me with a search warrant that had my name wrong.  If Álvaro works, everything is fine. Seizure of electronic media is the scope of the seizure and the procedure will be carried out tomorrow, Wednesday, 9/7/2017.  nothing happens It makes a document that What value can this document have, that is, they can put anything on it, that is, everything is fine, that is, it does not have to comply with any type of integrity, besides, it was, that is, legally, we are going to see Álvaro Alberto, everything is fine, this is  interesting and good with this raiding jack they took me quickly they raided my house they seized not only my electronic media but all the things to find  even a guillotine to cut papers an anonymous mask that everyone later in the world laughed saying I have 20 more expensive machines anonymous I also took a photo of the mask the only thing that is here in LEGO party and I put it as part of  the presentation to say even both parties are criminals according to the criteria of Uruguay well the press release from the Ministry of the Interior when this happened was something that took my hat off surgically prepared to paint someone to give people the perception that  someone is a horrible person who is the worst criminal in the world and but if one analyzes a little detail the press release some things that shut us down but no one realizes that because people ultimately are left with the perception that  these bad people live with the same little photos and so on. In other words, the capacity, the lack of analytical capacity and no thinking about people sometimes get scared  to this ah money Well why do you have so much money Alberto Why do you have so much money because I was dedicated to selling cryptocurrencies and others and yesterday the other day I sold two bitcoins to a European tourist and it was 4,000 euros or dollars per bitcoin nothing was that because you have  so much money why do you have so much money from Where to get the bitcoins from local bitcoins.com I get in touch with people and there is a solution don't lie to me Alberto don't lie to me I know the records from 10 years ago and you can't lie to me that was in  In 2017 the bitcoins had I think that 8 years of that is, this person has known him for 10 Wow there is a chapter in my book called satoshi na uruguayo because I think it is this very visionary person well And here is the photo of that was the photo  from here from the ecopark with the anonymous mask that in Uruguay is very dangerous the issue is that the Uruguayan police bragged and said in the house of the arrested person we found bitcoins or therefore that proof  ba of the person is guilty also the mask of the only thing that was the definitive proof these two these two physical coins for the police were bitcoins which is something I don't know I am ashamed of others But what do I know I'm fine or nobody  He didn't even question it, not even the force But hey, that's fine, I thought, well, don't buy this type of Alberto thing anymore because you're going to get the most problems, that is, no Souvenirs Because they're going to come out, it's going to cost you quite clearly February 2018 I  I'm in jail I'm going to jail The judge's decision to send me to jail was taken on September 11, 2017 two days after my very quick arrest and it was something that I went to preventive detention because the judge justified that the pressure of the only measure that could  that it was appropriate for my case because I was a person who had a great risk of fleeing the country. Yes, it is reasonable for something like that, I looked at the country but I would throw my whole house overboard. You are right and second p  or my leap in computer knowledge I could alter the rest of the processes basically what I was saying is that with my mental abilities with my mind I could only alter evidence that was stored in Interpol under lock and key because with the mind you can do it, that is, I would love to be able to boast about that I have  I have to admit that not for now I can't do that with my mind but with those two arguments it was that he justified pretrial detention instead of alternative measures like I don't know about a bail I don't know where there is a domiciliary expression There are a lot of alternatives before sending one  a person to jail, which is the last thing that would be considered And that implies many things, that is, putting a person in jail is basically destroying a person destroying their environment destroying their future you are causing a lot of damage nothing, that is, and also after my experience  from jail I can say that the people who are in jail are not really perfectly could not not be there  except for some exceptional cases of very violent people or with certain personality characteristics that really cannot be part of or interact with society, they are a danger to most people, jail seems to me an extreme measure But hey, those in a personal capacity, the issue is that  Prior to that decision, what happened was that two agents, an agent interposed at my house during the town hall, approached me. I, without knowing my rights, having been interrogated by three Interpol officials and at one point, one of them got  quite aggressive and he asked me questions about tox he dresses at the address www.blabla punto bla bla barra xwzx44 and I tell him I don't know it could be I don't remember Oh don't you remember I'm going to help you remember that I looked at the guy  and I said Excuse me, what is your name and the guy facing up didn't tell me his name and nothing seemed strange to me that I thought someone from the justice system was a police officer an official  Interpol should identify himself in those circumstances but he didn't laugh in the face it was very strange they didn't tell me my rights no I mean I was totally lost and well and the next day when they went to execute the parking lot one of them came up and told me Look  You have two possibilities: one, confess this or two, we're going to go look for your mother, we're going to take her to jail, she's going to have a very bad time, we do the same with you, with your girlfriend, we're going to go with her, we're going to make her suffer a lot, so you choose and  Well, at that moment when one is totally seized because one is totally unprepared, what went through my mind was I want this to end I don't know how I got into this anymore Ok if I confess Ok I'll be able to prove Without a doubt that I don't  I did nothing because there will be no records that I have done anything because I did not do anything. In other words, nothing will be able to be proven innocent little dove that was it did not matter that they did not have to prove anything yes yes yes they said  n that I did it and it is there, the part of the test was enough and others had no value And I had to eat 8 months of preventive detention due to my dangerousness due to my risk of escape but in February 2018 a person appeared to visit me at the  jail and nothing he began to ask me questions and he told me and when you leave and when you leave and when you leave and I said I don't know I don't know I don't know and I told him that my lawyer was handling the possibility of requesting temporary releases which are a privilege granted to him  to inmates for good conduct, but this is, for example, a certain number of hours a week that they can get out of jail, but it is something that is granted gradually.  12 hours are given once a month, then 24 hours the second month and they are evaluating and to reach the three days, maybe he dies a better year, this person talked about it and the following Thursday it was  on a sunday this on thursday they call me descubredica from the jail and they tell me Alberto they accepted you the temporary tasks 72 hours a week the jail the director of the jail picks up the phone and calls the judge because I had never seen that to confirm that there was not a  mistake no there was no mistake this person who sent me to jail because I was a flight risk mentally altering the evidence and others gives me 73 days a week so that I can do these things stay in theory I did not want me to do it was quite curious But  I'm not going to go into detail about that. The issue is that this person didn't do it because for reasons I don't know, benevolence, but actually, he wanted me to choose a bank.  Central Bank this his credit profile and I don't know for most banks he was a bad customer he was really bad financially and he told me and I asked him  money lenders who are going to kill me and a bank jet yes Alberto and I had a whole plan for that although I don't go out on another Monday for God's sake well the issue is that a lot of stress and other things involved I ended up opening my eyes at one point  seeing a light like that completely in front of my eyes and some sounds some noises that turn into voices and then those voices into words and they approach me and a woman comes and tells me do you know where you are you are in the peach hospital cti  you were in a coma for three hours Ok basically I was like dead for three hours and now I'm reviving Okay no wonder at this point these things are not rare in me but well and nothing was falling falling falling and when I thought that nothing else worse could happen happened happened happened  And well it was something that never ended where things just didn't stop all of them all seemed seemed seemed like someone was making fun of me but well at the end in May 2018 my lawyer  baldy and the court against the sentence of the pretrial detention judge and ruled in my favor but Ok by means of a real security of Ten thousand dollars to a deposit of $10,000 I was able to return to my house that is and there I got the file that  Ok, this is justice. I mean, if I have money to go home and if I don't have money, I have to easily forget about here, that is, this is justice, this is the greatest justice in the world, that is, because I have money, I can go home  And if I don't have money, I'm left suffering here. I didn't realize many things that I never had the idea of ​​how this whole system worked for me. Being was not part of my life. I never questioned it. I never even tried to understand it and then this  This experience really made me realize how many problems there are and how unfair it is and how unnecessarily people suffer and how the people who are imprisoned really are people who are simply imprisoned for having been born in a certain context and  they are deleted if I had been born in the same context that would have ended up in prison and I was not born in the same context I ended up anyway But that is also relative I don't know the truth that it took me 41 divided years to realize that justice is a beautiful word  but that in fact layers that stays there in a beautiful word and there is not really justice but there are justices depending on who you are how much power you have How much money you have which is very sad but well the thing is that I was there for a long time  time meditating on what was happening and I realized the enormous problem that exists in the issue of how computer crimes are investigated in Uruguay, the ignorance and incompetence of people who decide the future of other people and are totally ignorant to do it or  Either it's like they ask me for my medical opinion about something to decide on someone's future, or it looks good, but the PC is capable of  has something I don't ask me I don't know anything about wondering about how I don't know I don't even tell you to use Linux because it's too complicated but using Windows Vista isn't too complicated either but eh I don't know don't ask me I have to be competent what I do  If I am going to have so much responsibility, I was the first expert witness in a case in 2004. In Uruguay, there was speculation about a law that was against the production of child pornography, and I was the expert witness in that, in the first case related to that law, basically what happened in  At that time, Spain's computer crime brigade was monitoring the networks and detecting child pornographic material, identifying where it came from and sending those countries listed with supports among those Uruguay and nothing they did here in Uruguay was pick up the phone Call the provider  access to the internet find out the person's address go fill it out torture them and send the prisoner that's what they did and b  Well, I was in the part of the experience for a little while because really on one day a judge told me when I presented her a draft report and it said many images of such a tenor were detected, the judge told me Alberto I can't say  several many you have to give the exact number of photographs and when I had to count more than 3000 photographs of child pornography I realized that I was not going to count them anymore that it was very sick and nothing that my mental health was more important than anything And unfortunately  at that time there was no other type of case than for which someone in computer forensics was used This So I know more or less a little about the subject and I could see a lot of problems that I really want to see solved because it happened to me  but it could happen to him it can happen to any of you to your children to your neighbors to your loved ones because there is no guarantee of a process that is trans  Parent of course Simply because I suddenly know, I grab a person's cell phone and send a photo with child pornography to another, I can screw up another person's life because they will never carry out an appropriate investigation to really identify what happened, but rather they will take  The fact that there was a photograph of such a tenor on such a device and the device was such a person works from companies to people, that is, it is complicated, that is, it is a problem that I am determined to transmit because ok. When one detects a problem in a system and and that  The problem causes harm to people Ok, what is done, we talk about it, awareness is created, if awareness is not created, there is no problem, that is, we have to talk about it, people have to understand that there is a problem to start treating the problem, that is  they have to know everything about it, understand the problem and then, well, from then on see how to deal with it. So this seems to me to be a huge problem in Uruguay in part  State official commenting before other kids I don't know the interpol agents assumed from before that they carry out certain procedures they should comply with some standards or I don't know if their education, experience and other computer forensic certifications are standardized but not someone who did not finish secondary education ago  work like going to someone's house like my house grab a cell phone that is turned off turn on the cell phone ask me when to stop I say you can't do that you are going to answer contaminating the better time I got married Alberto and then I realized that that cell phone from the  The day they seized me until the Friday after a Sunday Friday was on all the time connected to a network Ok a cell phone that is never seized It should be having any type of connection to any network among other things because the information can be remotely deleted  can be modified that is and if it is done for some particular reasons  All this has to be documented, that is, who turned it on, why turned it on?  nothing existed Ok that is wrong everything that is done has to be documented custody of information nothing I mean I am not going to go into some things that were stolen from me that I lost because they are quite depressing but they returned me an empty box of something that had a lot of  value and when I told them Where is the inside they told me No and we caused the empty box Ah the empty box is an electronic means as it says the parking lot is ok ok Yes actually I got really hot at that time now I'm pretty calm but in this  I didn't take it very well at the moment and there are people who understand why because I think it involved a little money, this is what  ue was lost and nothing but they can do it and they do it the power they have is impressive and the consequences for doing things wrong do not have them justice does not apply to them maybe I mean what a surprise justice we like and nothing this I came back  my house I found 18 hard drives lying on the floor 18 hard drives of the largest ones of five rooms I mean, I did not find Memories of cartilage on the floor I found hard drives on the floor but which one I tripped over when I walked  Ok, the raid was a show, how could they have done this and left all these hard drives here? The PCS weighed about 34 kilos, I put it in a box, there is something very strange, well, then I went to see the file, the file said for the  mutualist that if they didn't want the information that was hacked to be revealed they had to send I don't know how many bitcoins and to the following address two points two white points there was no address east street r  anso dies really pathetic and he is listening to me Look at this I mean, what a shame he really didn't have a payment address, that is, the first question the prosecutor should have asked me is how you thought you would charge for this if there was no payment address, it never happened to him  Mind you, the only thing he asked me was why I had a device called USB Killer because I reported it to him, I was desperate when they discarded it, praying that the number would be connected to the computer and the next day it was in a photo in the file with a ruler  saying Google and the prosecutor asking me about it so that I spoke so that I spoke everything you said they take it against There it is 24 hours to look at 15,000 with the following address two white white dots nobody asked about it later they remember this person that I reported  the incident in october 2014 the director of the sert well the judge interrogates him and asks him if alberto gil had reported any problem  Security problem on this server of this powerful medical service, he says, I saw some documents, some things, I didn't find anything, he was checking, but no, I don't remember, and I didn't find anything. Ok, we are in criminal proceedings, the answer is yes or no.  In addition, you have a system where you record all this, every record is associated with a tracking number, a ticket number, and it is simply to enter and search for all the reports that you have made and, if you answer them, bet yes or no, you can answer by force, no, no.  I didn't find anything if you answer the question, that's basically what the judge is telling you, she's going to interpret that I'm lying from top to bottom and without saying she's not going to believe me at all.  pig has already been this was something that I still wonder why What need does this do because there is behind all this I do not have the answer I do not know but his answer was no  I remembered that I would have done this. Also, all of us in this area know that if someone reports that a service, like a health service provider with 200,000 clients, can be accessed through admin, we don't forget these things, we can forget a lot of things.  but this type of thing remains for anecdotes and I don't know, I have a very good memory but this person would not forget these things. He did not have to remember either, it was to enter a system and search for the information and if I had known this, copying would have been prohibited.  of the emails with the ticket numbers and their answers but they never asked me for anything besides that it doesn't matter but this is really good the only time in Uruguay the press gave me time to talk about the subject even though all the journalists in my country know about it  This people only know the information that was published by the Ministry of the Interior that information so beautiful saying all the dangers  or that it was how bad it was and doing a beautiful toxing basically I think he failed to say the address of where he lived, that is, in the photos there were cards from places where he had worked with my photo my credit cards my name with the valid numbers with the  numbers that could be seen in high resolution, that is, thanks for being obsessed. That is, it is clear that you have it, or that is, please, you cannot publish those photos like that with a credit card in that way, so Ok, people only had that version in  In 2020 I think Mateo Martínez, I don't know if he's around here, puts me in contact with a journalist from a Montevideo channel who was looking for someone who has had problems with the law for something related to computers and he interviews me at my house  two hours later we are talking at the end when when they leave the cameraman tells me the truth is crazy that for you it must be a humiliation that points the finger at you, that is, they accuse you of  having looted from NASA or others is all good but this is pathetic And yes, the truth is that it is sad but well the issue is that this note was never published, it never aired because the woman said as I said Hello, how are you doing?  note I'm harassed by the Ministry of the Interior and they say Hello Alberto, no, on the contrary, what's happening to us is that we're dealing with the Ministry of the Interior, I spoke in response to your statements and we're not getting it. The Ministry of the Interior didn't want to talk about my case, they decided not to talk  In other words, that says a lot, no. In other words, they don't want to answer any questions about what I said, it says a lot. I don't know, it's my interpretation. November 2021, let's go quickly and I'm going to recover from Interpol the last belongings that they have in their possession, which are mine, and open a  Twitter space on a cell phone I don't know I don't know why that occurred to me and the conversation was being heard by people from all over the world calling him a person from Mexico to do it  to a translation in real time and it's not going to be heard very well but this was basically what the crypto training medical informatics director would spend willingly crowded some of that could have been I thought But don't worry around here at the end of the year or the year  What's coming if you're interested, we have new people and the idea of ​​teaching them with the desire. Unfortunately, the older people retired and left. The knowledge is gone, I'm going.  He asks me to teach them about cryptocurrencies because he doesn't have the slightest [ __ ] idea. Sorry for the word on how to deal with all the fraud that was happening in MercadoLibre, mostly people scamming people with bitcoins and they didn't know what to do, I mean, and the guy told me  You are a reference on the subject, this guy That was the same guy who told me he was yelling at me and telling me that you knew about bitcoin 10 years ago when he was in  n my house, this same person was the one who asked me if I could teach them because they had no idea how to handle this New Wave of crimes that involve cryptocurrencies. I think that says a lot about this whole case, how sad the case is.  closed at the beginning of this year I have no criminal record none This I am a person who lives a totally normal life I have no criminal record nothing but the scars from all this obviously one is going to carry forever are those traumatic I hope  that this does not happen to any of you but I want you to know that doing it correctly and ethically sometimes does not give the results that one expects so be careful with what you do and nothing I would love this too I would love for everything  this to learn when you are in situations that you see are not correct or perceive but you are not correct that you take actions and talk about it that you do not stay ca  Talking is the only way to improve things and you will find people who will agree with you and otherwise we will always continue with the same problems complaining if we are not part of the solution we are part of the problem and I don't think so  that you want to be part of any problem I do not want to be that is why I have gotten into so much trouble in my life for not wanting to be part of problems it ended up being a problem suffering many problems thanks Alberto the truth is that the story is shocking it is incredible as the  ignorance in the hands of justice is terrible does anyone have any questions to ask can you raise your hand if you can't get close to the microphone in the middle can you do it some line if there is nothing we say goodbye Hello Alberto Thank you very much for the talk and thank you very much for stopping by  up there and share it with us a pleasure and a pride and thanks to you for giving me the chance to express myself and talk about  These issues, which is what I'm looking for, to talk about these things, is the only way to change. Thank you very much, it's thanks, thanks to you. It's very, very important for me to know that you're there.  maybe they did it to you many times but now there are guys in Uruguay surely who are working and doing computer security things right now and well what advice Well what advice they ask me Alberto what do I do I have answered the problem and I tell him I don't want to  listen because they ask me because there are people who after what happened to me Ok were afraid to continue reporting problems to the expert in particular and someone someone promptly contacted the certi and asked Ok we have legal guarantees that it will not work for us  We are going to have consequences if we report certain things and the person's response was no, we cannot guarantee anything. Ok, I'll tell you the answer.  The size of the incident is probably the most important input that any computer security information management system can have, knowing how to know what is happening is worth gold if we do not measure this through incident reports, we do not know, we have no idea what  is happening I mean, let's encourage the reporting of incidents no no no no let's not do this type of thing that makes people afraid of doing it not in the real world people are rewarded I mean let's not even talk about the bombanti programs and so on  but in companies I don't know, certain prizes or raffles are given, they are given, officials are encouraged to report things in some way, that's okay. It tells you about gold, it is probably the best input that an information system management system has and  what the state is doing what it was doing was really only hurting them because they were going to end up having to fix problems that they could have  be resolved in a proactive way eh eh eh eh eh through this kind of thing but not which surprises me a lot and also makes me wonder why there are many things that I don't understand and I would like to understand maybe I never have the answer for many things but  but hey, I know what it looks like and it worries me and well it's like that but it's sad it's sad the people I tell you the people don't want to report the people who know what happened what happened to me in particular no I don't want to report it has  He contacted me and he told me things that I did not want to hear on the subject of problems and I have become like a small being of a psychological cert providing psychological support to people who have existential dilemmas about what to do what to do Well I don't know what to do No  I don't know, eh, no, I'm not lying, I'm trying to guide you, eh, eh, they reported the right thing, that is, protect yourselves, try to do it in a way that makes it anonymous, that is, the greatest thing is, you're never going to do anything, but protect the r  Report it in such a way that it is difficult to identify it if you want to report it nothing if you want to report it report it it is positive I do not report anymore say I got out of jail and a few days later I was in another medical system and all I did was screenshot for LEGO that is I was  there, uh, give me catecillos but we went because of the ego issue.  another system obviously hypothetically speaking have some kind of access this is not recording I don't need no other fundamental issue lawyers lawyers who know about the subject Well nobody knows anything and if we don't get into a cryptocurrency issue and talk about the fts that is we celebrate in fts  we killed each other they went crazy there is one a lot of training is needed for the lawyers to all the to all the judicial actors on  It really seems to me that this type of issue is important, although they should not know everything, they had to have interlocutors and they were capable of translating the technical aspects of a specific cause into a language that the judge or lawyer can understand to make the corresponding decisions, that is ideal. Good  If you have people who are telling you that they seized two bitcoins that are like that and those are your references, you trust the decisions that you are going to make. They are probably indecisions that maybe they are not the best.  and education is something that is magical but sometimes I miss it thank you see you Alberto we will meet
