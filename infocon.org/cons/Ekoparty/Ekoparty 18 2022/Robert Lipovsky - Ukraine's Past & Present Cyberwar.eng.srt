1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,598
foreign

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,249
[Music]

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,320
[Music]

4
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,099
go

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
go go

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,920
ahead

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,460
no not yet

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,739
yeah okay great

9
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,079
okay hello everyone it's great to be

10
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,780
back uh speaking at Echo party because

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,079
the last time I spoke here was in 2017

12
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,100
and uh uh topic of my presentation back

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,980
then was actually in destroyer and today

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,260
believe it or not I'm gonna be the talk

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,880
is going to be somewhat of a sequel to

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,820
that I'll talk about in Destroyer 2 I'll

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,740
do a recap of in Destroyer the the

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,479
original version

19
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,619
um but it's not going to be the only

20
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,299
thing we'll cover so we'll take a closer

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,580
look at the broader

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,799
um broader topic of the Cyber war that

23
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,100
we've been seeing unraveling in Ukraine

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
uh with a primary focus on the send or

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,080
maybe T group but also a little bit

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,960
about some some others as well

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
so for those those of you who don't know

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,860
me I'm Robert lipovsky I'm a principal

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,900
threat intelligence researcher for ESET

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,020
uh I lead uh one of the threat ESET um

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,720
threat research teams in HQ in uh

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Bratislava Slovakia

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,340
uh the role of our team is primarily to

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,040
track apts and when I say primarily I

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,579
mean mostly but not exclusively uh so we

36
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,200
also follow notable cyber criminal

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
developments as well

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,659
so but today's talk is going to be

39
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,219
focusing on apts so here's a the list of

40
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,639
the most notable apt groups in my

41
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,099
opinion that have carried out targeted

42
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,819
campaigns against Ukraine over the years

43
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,980
um bear in mind that even this is not a

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,140
comprehensive list

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,180
um and we're gonna

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,580
put the spotlight on one of these groups

47
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,099
we'll focus on in my opinion the most

48
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,959
aggressive of these groups the one

49
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,300
behind the power grid attacks and that

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,500
is sandworm

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,900
so sandworm has been attributed to the

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,580
Russian military intelligence service

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,200
the Gru and in October 2020 the FBI even

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,260
released a public indictment of the six

55
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,959
Gru hackers for taking part in some of

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,940
the attacks we're going to be discussing

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,220
in just a second

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,200
by the way in case you're wondering

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,019
where the name sandworm comes from well

60
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,200
here's the answer in some of the early

61
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,940
campaigns that were actually using the

62
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,879
black energy malware we discovered these

63
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,220
text strings in the command and control

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,099
addresses so apparently the operators

65
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,060
were fans of Frank Herbert's classic

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,800
um we first talked about these Dune

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,540
references at the virus bulletin

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,959
conference in 2014 uh but it was

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,400
actually eyesight Partners now under

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
mandian uh that coined the sanward

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,239
moniker

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,800
um and if you're interested in the whole

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,220
story I do encourage you to read Andy

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,879
Greenberg's book uh on various uh sand

75
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,640
worm campaigns it's a really good read

76
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,120
so we've been tracking this apt group

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,819
from basically the beginning

78
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,920
um since black energy involved from a

79
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
cyber criminal uh commodity piece of

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,260
malware to a cyber weapon

81
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,860
um in the hands of of this APD group and

82
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,440
the earliest sandworm traces in our

83
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,280
Telemetry uh date back to 2011 and

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,319
here's a decoy document that was being

85
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,260
used at the time uh referencing a

86
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,080
conference that would be happening at

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,459
the beginning of the following year

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,939
then towards the end of 2013

89
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,160
we observed a notable increase in

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,798
targeted apt activity against Ukrainian

91
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,919
high-profile targets and if we take a

92
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,080
look at the geopolitical situation and

93
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,120
and developments around the time so you

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,860
can see that this was preceding the

95
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,320
Russian occupation of Crimea and the

96
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,620
beginning of the war in donbass

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,139
um sand worm targeted all types of

98
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,320
organizations including government

99
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,840
diplomatic media transportation and even

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,419
Ukrainian elections

101
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,460
one of the main methods that they would

102
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,199
use to infiltrate these organizations

103
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,900
would be through carefully crafted

104
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,900
highly targeted spearfishing emails and

105
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,240
here's one example that even uses the

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,600
war in donbass azuler I'm not going to

107
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,940
do a little translation of that but the

108
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,740
email basically says that the Ukrainian

109
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,660
prime minister is instructing various

110
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,300
State institutions to check every

111
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,940
Parliament member and members of other

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,699
organizations for supporting separatists

113
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,780
in the East and in the attachment there

114
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,820
was a PowerPoint presentation with a

115
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,520
list of these alleged separatist

116
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,720
supporters

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
so I think we can all agree that this is

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,400
really good social engineering this

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,740
isn't like your typical Nigerian prince

120
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,100
camp and in the background

121
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,900
it would lead to the download and

122
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,880
installation of the black energy malware

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,060
from the attacker's remote server

124
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,160
um moreover this was actually exploiting

125
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
a zero day vulnerability in PowerPoint

126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,160
that was CV 2014 4114 so this meant that

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,020
the recipients of these of these emails

128
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,340
could have had could have been

129
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,620
compromised even if they had the fully

130
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,979
patched versions of Windows in office

131
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,419
so

132
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,060
black energy was used in many campaigns

133
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,479
against many organizations

134
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,280
uh but definitely the most notable

135
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,500
attack and the one that caught the

136
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,940
attention of the global cyber security

137
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,120
industry uh was the one against the

138
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Ukrainian power grid which culminated in

139
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,460
December 2015 when it became the first

140
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,620
ever blackout caused by a Cyber attack

141
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,720
and I specifically choose the word

142
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
culminated because I mean that was just

143
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,319
the end game the visible part of the

144
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
attack which was obviously preceded by

145
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,620
initial access lateral movement

146
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,600
reconnaissance and all that and that

147
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,699
actually preceded this this this end

148
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,919
goal in December by by many months prior

149
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,680
to that

150
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,620
so this attack was facilitated by black

151
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,240
energy and again I choose my worst

152
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,060
pretty um carefully

153
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,160
um because black energy didn't cause the

154
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,319
blackout directly

155
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,319
um so it facilitated the attack and the

156
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,120
attack was carried out in a coordinated

157
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
manner against multiple Electro

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
distribution companies uh in various

159
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,840
regions of the country these companies

160
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,780
are called oboe energos from the word uh

161
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,560
Obel oblasty meaning region in Ukrainian

162
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,780
so the attackers misuse remote access

163
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,440
software uh radmin specifically to

164
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
manually switch off the flow of

165
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
electricity and then as a result of that

166
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,340
the homes of around 230 000 ukrainians

167
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,800
across different regions in the country

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,099
went home went dark for several hours

169
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,520
depending on the region

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,000
and here's a here's an Infamous video uh

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,639
that was leaked uh and this was taken by

172
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,860
one of the operators at a targeted

173
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,539
electric substation

174
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,660
uh the video is showing the attackers

175
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,740
remotely connecting to this workstation

176
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,060
and they're interacting with the scada

177
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,000
software there manipulating with the

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,759
circuit breakers and in just a second

179
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,240
you'll see that the the the two phone

180
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,120
tilts below to show that nobody is

181
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,740
touching the mouse or the keyboard

182
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,380
foreign

183
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,940
almost exactly one year later in

184
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,120
December 2016 uh there was another

185
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,400
blackout that was again caused by a

186
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,020
Cyber attack and this time the attackers

187
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,840
really stepped up their game

188
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,700
there were quite a number of differences

189
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,979
between this attack and the black energy

190
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,520
facilitated attack the the year prior

191
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,679
um in this this time there was only one

192
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,779
substation that was hit

193
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,300
um uh but the attackers they had much

194
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,339
higher Ambitions um we discovered the

195
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,899
malware that they used that was in

196
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,320
destroyer and unlike the previous year's

197
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,779
manual disruption industry was the first

198
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,080
ever malware specifically designed to

199
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,180
attack power grids in an automatic

200
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,740
automated way

201
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,320
and I'll come back to that later when we

202
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,959
do a closer recap of how in Destroyer

203
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,760
operated

204
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,060
so in the following years there was a

205
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,060
lot of evolution of the tool set used by

206
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,000
sandworm and the group sort of split its

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
activities and we've been tracking them

208
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,440
at a fairly granular level so as you've

209
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,959
seen black energy cluster in Destroyer

210
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,080
uh tell about malware gray energy so

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,540
around this time we've seen them split

212
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,540
into the gray energy cluster which

213
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,339
continued attacks against the energy

214
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,760
sector primarily in Ukraine but also in

215
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,140
Poland for example

216
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,320
uh and the telebots uh cluster which

217
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,600
carried out attacks mainly against the

218
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,300
financial sector in Ukraine

219
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,519
and tell about was also the subgroup

220
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,500
behind the infamous not Petty outbreak

221
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,860
in June 2017. uh now obviously there's

222
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,080
no need to go into detail on what became

223
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
uh the most devastating the most costly

224
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,000
Cyber attack in history uh I just want

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,860
to tip my virtual hat to Anton

226
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,279
chiropanov in my team who uh discovered

227
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,360
uh

228
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,600
two important things about the napatia

229
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,820
epidemic first was its origin um or the

230
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,920
patient zero if you will

231
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,440
um and and pinpoint it down to a supply

232
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279
chain compromise of uh the Emmy doc uh

233
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,339
software company creating the the

234
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,760
um uh vendor creating the Emmy doc

235
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,700
software being the most popular uh tax

236
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,580
filing and and uh economical software

237
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,260
used throughout the country

238
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,080
and through that effectively made the

239
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
attribution link that napekia was the

240
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
work of sandworm

241
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,760
then in 2018 we discovered a telebots

242
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,360
backdoor that we called exermel and this

243
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,459
was a really significant Discovery

244
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,140
because

245
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,839
after one and a half years this was the

246
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,360
first hard bit of evidence for

247
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,940
attributing in Destroyer to sandworm

248
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,399
based on code similarity I mean

249
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,399
obviously all of us folks in in the

250
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,959
industry were thinking I mean the

251
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,579
industry was probably the work of

252
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,579
sandwich it makes sense based on the

253
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,839
developments that we've been seeing

254
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,120
based on the black energy attack before

255
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,220
but until this discovery of external

256
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,160
there was no actual uh public evidence

257
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,800
any hard hard proof to to support those

258
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,579
hypotheses

259
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,700
and then in the following years we saw

260
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,399
sandworm attacks in Ukraine but also in

261
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,019
other countries so there was Olympic

262
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,240
destroyer in Korea there was gray energy

263
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,260
in Poland uh sand time in Georgia and

264
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,540
turkey there was a ceremy discovered in

265
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,180
France and this

266
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,700
this basically answers a question that

267
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,980
that obviously comes to mind when

268
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,260
talking about the Cyber war in Ukraine

269
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,200
whether it these sandworm attacks can

270
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,360
affect other countries outside of

271
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,940
Ukrainian borders so uh the answer to

272
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,860
that is obviously yes it has happened in

273
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,300
the past and we need to be on the

274
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,579
lookout and and prepared for such

275
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,160
attacks in the future as well

276
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,180
anyway the the gru attackers continue to

277
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,200
be active throughout these years but the

278
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,060
most notable attacks that you can see on

279
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,339
the timeline really date between 2015

280
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,480
and and 2017 and they haven't been

281
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,180
creating headlines uh in the years after

282
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,700
that so they did continue to be active

283
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,360
but really kept a much lower profile

284
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
well until now

285
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,620
so on February 23rd uh this year uh just

286
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,560
before 5 PM Ukrainian local time

287
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,160
uh which was just a few hours before the

288
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,139
Russian military Invasion we detected

289
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,440
her medic wiper attacks uh in Ukraine

290
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,019
now obviously not expected what would

291
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,639
happen the next morning

292
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
um but with the escalation with the

293
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,360
geopolitical situation happening with

294
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,920
the Russian army station at the

295
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,100
Ukrainian border it was really tense and

296
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,260
we felt that this discovery shouldn't be

297
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,260
limited to our uh threat Intel customers

298
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,820
only but we wanted to share with the

299
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,000
community uh hence uh this this Twitter

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,700
feed and and it was a really long night

301
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,860
and I mean Jax is here then he can

302
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,880
corroborate that as well

303
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,980
um so hermetic wiper what was this about

304
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,440
so we detected it on hundreds of systems

305
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,680
in multiple Ukrainian organizations and

306
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,740
it was a pure Act of cyber sabotage so

307
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,959
it was trying to render these computers

308
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,540
on bootable and effectively any

309
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,459
public-facing services that they might

310
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,079
be running inaccessible

311
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,500
uh it was just the first in a series of

312
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,139
wipers we discovered in Ukraine since

313
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,279
February

314
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,100
and in this various wipers their their

315
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,500
technical level actually vary quite a

316
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,760
lot

317
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,399
um and uh hermetic wiper was actually

318
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,220
one of the one of the more advanced ones

319
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,220
uh I'll just I'll just uh point out one

320
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,079
notable feature so it was abusing a

321
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,019
driver of a legitimate this partitioning

322
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,959
software is us for its lower level file

323
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,180
system operations

324
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,000
um the compilation timestamp suggests

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,940
that the malware was prepared at least

326
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,579
several months before it was deployed

327
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,160
now hermetic wiper wasn't the only

328
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,500
malicious code used in this campaign

329
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,680
there were other components co-deployed

330
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,560
alongside with it there was this worm

331
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,959
component uh which we're calling

332
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,600
hermetic wizard which was being used to

333
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,339
spread the malware across the network

334
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,740
and then there was hermetic Ransom

335
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,139
another fall ransomware uh just like

336
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,440
nonpatia was by the way one of the

337
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,380
components in hermetic wizard was named

338
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,100
romance dll so an evident reference to

339
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,019
the Eternal romance exploit even though

340
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,420
no exploits were actually used in this

341
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,920
campaign

342
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,800
now if you think about it for a moment

343
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,079
um it is kind of strange to deploy a

344
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,579
wiper and a decoy ransomware which are

345
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,980
essentially the same thing right uh in

346
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,500
one single campaign

347
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,680
um moreover when hermetic Ransom was

348
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,839
even poorly written with a lot of a lot

349
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,720
of bugs and and programming errors in

350
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,199
contrast to to a hermetic wiper

351
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,180
um so a possible explanation for that is

352
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,100
that the malware was being deployed

353
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,860
through group policy so so machines were

354
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,600
downloaded at different times as they

355
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,940
were being turned on and the attackers

356
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,339
probably tried to deploy this hermetic

357
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,899
Ransom that they pulled out of the Shelf

358
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,540
uh at at this point after we were

359
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,920
detecting and blocking uh hermetic wiper

360
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,279
and here's the The Ransom message uh

361
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,959
displayed by hermetic Ransom after

362
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,720
encrypting the files and here are some

363
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,279
Easter eggs

364
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,180
um found in the code

365
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,120
okay moving forward

366
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,820
um on March 14th uh we discovered

367
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,699
another wiper uh this time uh we're

368
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,100
calling It Caddy wiper and I'm not going

369
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,620
to go into the technical details and and

370
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,540
obviously I'm also not covering all of

371
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,820
the wiper attacks we just we found quite

372
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,579
a few since February as I mentioned

373
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,660
um

374
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,000
but catty wiper was was notable because

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,399
we later saw it again in the in

376
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,440
Destroyer 2 incident

377
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,980
so this March 14th attack uh targeted

378
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,680
organizations in the financial sector

379
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
and from a technical point of view it

380
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,000
wasn't too interesting

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,560
um one notable thing that I will point

382
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,320
out is that it was avoiding uh

383
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,500
destroying data on domain controllers to

384
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
retain access inside the organizations

385
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,859
while still disrupting their operations

386
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,919
now on to the events of April 8th

387
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,919
so we were contacted by the Ukrainian

388
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,640
cert to help them respond to a cyber

389
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,280
incident at an energy provider in the

390
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,439
country and help them analyze a

391
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,480
suspicious piece of malware

392
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,660
and our analysis found out that the

393
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,280
threat was bigger than expected because

394
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,040
it was a new version of indestroyer

395
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,059
now on a positive note uh the while the

396
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,160
first in Destroyer incident caused the

397
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,380
blackout with a duration of about one

398
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,900
hour this latest one didn't even

399
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,380
accomplish that the attack was thwarted

400
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,240
thanks to a prompt response by The

401
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,740
Defenders at the targeted undergo

402
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,580
company uh cert UA and our assistance

403
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,940
but although no blackout took place it

404
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,820
was still a huge deal had the attack

405
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,460
been successful then more potentially

406
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,380
more than 2 million people could have

407
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,080
been left in the dark

408
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,820
since the targeted oboe undergo is the

409
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,740
provider of electricity in a region with

410
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,059
that many people

411
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,780
so in my opinion this has been uh the

412
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,580
most significant Cyber attack during the

413
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,780
war thus far even if unsuccessful

414
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,299
so now let's take a take a closer look

415
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,640
at at how industrial worked and what

416
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
makes it unique uh first looking looking

417
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,559
at the at the first version

418
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,740
um so it really is unique because it as

419
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,419
I said it's the first malware designed

420
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,820
specifically to attack power grids in an

421
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,580
automated way and at the same time it's

422
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,160
the second ever malware deployed to

423
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,260
cause physical damage to Industrial

424
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,080
Hardware the first being stuxnet and the

425
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,640
third being Triton later later after it

426
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,700
so in destroyers first main goal was to

427
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,340
de-energize power lines to open circuit

428
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,820
breakers at a preset time using uh its

429
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,919
payload modules and I'll take a closer

430
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,179
look at the architecture in just a

431
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,200
second

432
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,340
then second it would wipe scada software

433
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,140
um so that the operators couldn't see

434
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,940
the status of the environment couldn't

435
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,260
control it

436
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,020
that was the purpose of this wiper

437
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,480
component and this component was

438
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,360
noteworthy I mean remember sandworm as

439
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,039
you probably noticed it has this really

440
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,020
long history of of wiping and

441
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,380
destructive malware ever since black

442
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,880
energy plugins and and various kill disk

443
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
variants and so on

444
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,620
so this module specifically wipes files

445
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,660
belonging to scada software that some of

446
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,039
which you can see listed on the slide

447
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:44,940
there

448
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,700
and then it would render uh the control

449
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,620
station on bootable by corrupting the

450
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,600
registry and finally crashing that

451
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,140
machine by killing all the processes

452
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,020
so in destroyer's third

453
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,860
um turn uh impact point would be its

454
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,740
attempt to take out protection relays

455
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,740
now these protection relays they play a

456
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,419
really important role in electric grid

457
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,400
operations

458
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,559
as the name suggests they protect the

459
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,580
grid from harmful conditions and if they

460
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,799
were to be disabled then the grid could

461
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,299
become vulnerable

462
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:26,160
and that uh that uh impact uh was the

463
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,220
purpose of the of this denial of service

464
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,340
module uh which was supposed to exploit

465
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,620
a vulnerability in Siemens Semitic uh

466
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,620
sorry Siemens the protect devices uh by

467
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,200
sending a specially crafted uh UDP

468
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,140
packet to Port 50 000. uh this would

469
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,120
switch the protection relay into a

470
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,220
firmware update mode where it would be

471
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,100
stuck so effectively it wouldn't be

472
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,879
doing its job

473
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,940
now then the utility operators would try

474
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,220
to restore the power and they would do

475
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,679
so by reclosing the breakers manually by

476
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,299
switching to to a manual mode of

477
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,940
operations now with the protective

478
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,100
relays if these were disabled in the

479
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,260
previous step the create grid could

480
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,020
become unstable and possibly lead to

481
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,440
physical damage of hardware

482
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,940
and had this been successful then

483
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,580
obviously the outage that was caused in

484
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,400
the initial initial de-energization

485
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,440
could have lasted much longer than the

486
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,299
one hour that it did

487
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,760
so all in all the Russian had high

488
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,640
Ambitions with this industry attack but

489
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,740
they ultimately failed

490
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,659
um part because of better resilience of

491
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,520
the Ukrainian Defenders and part because

492
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,760
of coding mistakes that were found in

493
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,059
the industry implementation

494
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,179
so here's a quick overview of the

495
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,240
architecture in Destroyer is a modular

496
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,179
let's call it framework uh there was

497
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,220
this launcher component I'm not going to

498
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,020
go into detail of all of the components

499
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,880
just mention some of the more important

500
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,640
ones and the role of the launcher

501
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,159
component was to uh it was responsible

502
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,020
for the timing of the attack so there

503
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,260
was this hard-coded timestamp when it

504
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,179
would launch these payload modules to

505
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,919
open those circuit breakers

506
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,320
and these payload modules that you can

507
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,700
see there there were four of them and

508
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,380
they were implementing these four

509
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,880
different industrial communication

510
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,720
protocols IEC 101 IC 104 61850 and opcda

511
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,179
uh therefore most of these were

512
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,700
implemented as dlls and each of them had

513
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,720
their own configuration files

514
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm going to focus on ic-104 as that's

515
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,360
the protocol that's also used by in

516
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,020
Destroyer too

517
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,900
so this protocol

518
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,500
it's basically a network extension of

519
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,600
ic101 uh it's a telecontrol protocol

520
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,360
used in power grids uh it's really

521
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,159
extensive and we're not going to go into

522
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,539
the details

523
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,760
the problem with this protocol is that

524
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,919
it was designed decades ago without

525
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,020
focusing on security I mean there is no

526
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,940
authentication whatsoever

527
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,240
it operates in a client server model

528
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,820
where the control station is the client

529
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,179
and the remote station is the server

530
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,980
and what the malware is doing what

531
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,260
industry is doing is that it's creating

532
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,400
and transmitting these asdu messages

533
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,600
to change the state of the remote

534
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,159
station iOS

535
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,659
that's important for you to remember

536
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,940
remember ioa stands for information

537
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,760
object address and is flipping the state

538
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
of these iOS to off

539
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,700
now what those ioas map to exactly

540
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,919
depends on the configuration in the

541
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,679
substation environment

542
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,740
and here's here's a dummy configuration

543
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,400
so industry would create these telegrams

544
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,340
based on this configuration uh the

545
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,460
reason why I say dummy is because uh the

546
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,200
actual configuration using that attack

547
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
was not recovered it was wiped with the

548
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,100
wiper component

549
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,659
um so as you can notice here you can

550
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,700
Target multiple stations

551
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,640
um it's spawning concurrent threads uh

552
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,380
and just highlighting some of the some

553
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,880
of the members there so there's a

554
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,580
station IP and the port uh the process

555
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,159
of a legitimate scada application to

556
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,860
kill to avoid conflict

557
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,559
uh it also supports uh console all

558
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,539
output and also logging

559
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,720
and this basically illustrates the

560
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,940
operation so for example it's sending

561
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,940
these off commands to a range of iOS

562
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,419
from 10 to 15.

563
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:41,700
okay now let's take a look at the new

564
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,220
version the the latest in Destroyer 2

565
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,320
and compare and contrast it with with

566
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,700
the original

567
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,140
so

568
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,380
there is a lot of code similarity and we

569
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
can we can definitely say that it

570
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,940
evolved from the same source code

571
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,159
um there are notable differences in

572
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,220
architecture though where industry 2 is

573
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,220
a self-contained executable compared to

574
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,020
the original which was this modular

575
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,960
framework that I showed earlier

576
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,600
and it only implements the ioc 104

577
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,100
protocol

578
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,440
so since it's self-contained then also

579
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,140
the configuration uh isn't in in

580
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,059
Standalone configuration files but it's

581
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,640
embedded within that one uh one binary

582
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,340
which effectively means that for various

583
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,980
deployments the The Operators would have

584
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,320
to and various deployments with

585
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,760
different configurations the The

586
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,559
Operators would have to recompile it

587
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,820
each time

588
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,360
uh so we analyzed uh two samples with

589
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,220
different configurations

590
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,620
both of these samples appear to be

591
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,460
compiled on March 23rd of course this is

592
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,559
just the compilation which was uh

593
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,299
preceded by the coding and the

594
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,880
reconnaissance and all of that and we

595
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,500
have indication that they were in the

596
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,620
network of of this mobile undergo since

597
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,440
at least mid-February so so even before

598
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,779
the actual military invasion

599
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:10,080
so the new configuration format uh is

600
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,500
stored as a hard-coded string in

601
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,960
Destroyer 2 can communicate with

602
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,700
multiple devices at one similar to

603
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,000
similarly to its predecessor

604
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,980
with the two samples we analyzed one

605
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,260
contained eight different IP addresses

606
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,360
of devices and the other one contained

607
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,400
three and that's the one you can see on

608
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,559
this slide here

609
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,539
um the configuration contains values

610
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,580
that are used during the communication

611
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,539
uh through this I IEC 104 protocol like

612
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,120
asdu addresses ioas

613
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,279
um stuff like that

614
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,260
um and if we look at this this one

615
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,419
particular offset here so you can see

616
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,179
that it has the similar stuff that you

617
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,299
saw with the earlier one earlier in

618
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,400
Destroyer original so there's the

619
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,500
station IP the port

620
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,600
uh whether it should operate in this

621
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,059
range mode

622
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,140
there's this

623
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,900
um targeted uh process that it's trying

624
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,900
to terminate similarly to before so this

625
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,580
is a legitimate process that's used in

626
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,200
standard daily operations at that

627
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,320
utility and it's killing that in order

628
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,120
in order to avoid conflict with that

629
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,840
moreover it would rename that executable

630
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,000
of that application to prevent automatic

631
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
restart of that process

632
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,700
um then it lists the ioas that it should

633
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,900
Target

634
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,120
um those you can see there then there's

635
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,919
also other things like times uh like

636
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,679
timeouts and stuff like that

637
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,580
um in the uh in the samples we analyze

638
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,419
so one of the samples contain 110 uh iOS

639
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,100
that were specified and the other one

640
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,760
contains 68 ioas and I'll come back to

641
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,840
that

642
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,900
um in in the recap why that's important

643
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,900
so if we compare this this implement

644
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,059
this this uh format of the configuration

645
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,880
with uh the configuration of the

646
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
original in Destroyer we can see that it

647
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,260
basically contains the same stuff just

648
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,919
in this just in a different format

649
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,559
and when that is executed here's what

650
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,480
that configuration would kind of look

651
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,120
like if we would to convert it to a more

652
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,419
human readable form uh so basically you

653
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,700
can see that it's sending uh these

654
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,679
double commands and sending this this

655
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,260
off command to this range of specified

656
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,179
iOS

657
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,640
now the obvious question is what do

658
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,580
these iOS do and as as I mentioned

659
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,620
earlier it's it's a question that's

660
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,740
that's fairly hard to answer because the

661
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,480
ioa might mean something different from

662
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,220
utility to utility

663
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,020
it really depends on the used equipment

664
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,140
the setting configurations and all that

665
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,460
stuff

666
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,760
um if we Google one of these ioas we

667
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,760
stumble upon this documentation uh from

668
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,100
ABB

669
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,679
and some of these iOS belong to a

670
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
circuit breaker failure protection so

671
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
the industry 2 sample may have been

672
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,179
trying to turn off this protection

673
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,539
device

674
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:14,580
so this screen shows the similarity

675
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,559
between the code between the old version

676
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,299
and the new one as you can see they're

677
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,700
the same uh some of the same string

678
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,700
constants uh similar code fragments uh

679
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,679
being used I'll leave that up for just a

680
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,240
second so you can compare that

681
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,919
and here's the console output uh it

682
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,020
changed as well before it was more

683
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,039
verbose it was clean and even colorful

684
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,320
uh the new newer version is is a lot

685
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,600
less clear they're using some error

686
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,700
codes instead of text and and stuff like

687
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,100
that

688
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,440
now similar to the in Destroyer incident

689
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,399
in 2016 in the industry 2 attack there

690
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,919
was also additional malware co-deployed

691
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,240
to amplify the impact of the disruption

692
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,220
specifically this was again

693
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,740
uh no surprise being done through wipers

694
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,020
with the intention to make the recovery

695
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,740
more difficult and also to cover uh the

696
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,360
attacker's tracks and to thwart

697
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,659
post-incident investigation

698
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,179
so there were again different flavors of

699
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,640
wipers there was caddy wiper again uh

700
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,000
for Windows and there was orc shred solo

701
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,340
shred and awful shred targeting machines

702
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,559
with Linux and Solaris operating systems

703
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,220
all of these implemented in bash what's

704
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,720
interesting is that orc shred is

705
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,520
actually a worm and it's trying to

706
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,200
connect to all hosts reachable on the

707
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
network through SSH and then it would

708
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,899
try credentials from a list and then

709
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,860
we'll try to run the wipers

710
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,320
uh here's the timeline of the incident

711
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,679
so the attackers used uh scheduled tasks

712
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,340
to execute malware after uh the malware

713
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,100
after the deployment and that's what

714
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,380
enabled us to reconstruct and know when

715
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,940
exactly is the center where operators

716
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,580
wanted to perform this attack

717
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,340
um so just two minutes before four this

718
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,159
is all Ukrainian local time uh they

719
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,140
would deploy caddy wiper on some windows

720
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,480
machines in that in that Network and the

721
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,200
Linus and Solaris malware as well

722
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
then four minutes later they were

723
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,419
created that scheduled task to launch in

724
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,140
Destroyer two uh then at 5 10 was the

725
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,600
schedule execution of in Destroyer 2 to

726
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,659
de-energize the grid and that then 10

727
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:40,980
minutes after that there was the

728
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,500
schedule execution of caddy wiper on the

729
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,740
same machine as industry 2 to erase its

730
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,100
traces

731
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,760
so in order to the schedule task uh the

732
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,980
Linux wipers were also using Chrome to

733
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,580
launch themselves at a specific time

734
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,020
um and you can see that this skirt is

735
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,820
trying to launch the different type of

736
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,740
wiper based on the operating system

737
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,600
either Linux or Solaris

738
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,020
so caddy wiper as I mentioned in in when

739
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,940
I was describing the March 14th incident

740
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,580
uh the wiper itself is relatively

741
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,360
unremarkable so it's wiping the C users

742
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,980
directory and then the whole drives from

743
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,620
D onwards or overriding files with zeros

744
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,779
uh then it's corrupting the partition

745
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,320
table making the machine unbootable

746
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,080
but perhaps more noteworthy than the

747
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,080
loader uh no no more noteworthy than the

748
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,899
wiper itself is the loader that it was

749
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,299
uh being used to load it

750
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,940
um and that's called argue patch and it

751
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,860
takes the four it took the form in this

752
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,440
in this campaign uh as a small piece of

753
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,480
code that was inserted into the remote

754
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,539
debugger of Ida Pro

755
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,059
now take a moment to think about that I

756
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,799
mean typically when malware takes the

757
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,260
form of a legitimate binary it's for

758
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,799
masquerading purposes right uh but Ida

759
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,220
isn't used at an electric substation

760
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,220
I mean we researchers use it to analyze

761
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,299
malware

762
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,140
so the only way that I translate it that

763
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,200
is that the attackers are trolling us

764
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,419
and this was then later confirmed in a

765
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,460
later campaign when we saw are you patch

766
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,279
again and this time they were using an

767
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,559
ESET executable script of its signature

768
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,980
as its host file

769
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,220
and even in this later campaign argue

770
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,260
patch was still being used to deploy

771
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,960
caddy wiper and we believe that sandworm

772
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,899
is actively leaking information stolen

773
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,659
during these campaigns so leaking them

774
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,260
on Telegram

775
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,659
okay now let's take a talk a little bit

776
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,299
about defense uh and highlight a couple

777
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,080
of opportunities to detect this activity

778
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,700
uh so in addition to endpoint detection

779
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,380
software

780
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,580
um first

781
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,279
uh we release some pcaps uh that

782
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,260
contained the capture Network traffic

783
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,859
produced by the industry to samples uh

784
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:12,780
they're up on our GitHub you can you can

785
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,940
play around with them you can research

786
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,699
yourself in addition to that we released

787
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,159
a snort rule that can be used to detect

788
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,800
this network traffic and the idea behind

789
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,440
that rule is to detect these single or

790
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
double commands to important ioas like

791
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,960
the failure protection that I mentioned

792
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,960
but there are a few limitations to this

793
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,619
approach like it's not always possible

794
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,139
um to to monitor the network in this in

795
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,960
this I iot environment also you need to

796
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,879
identify the iOS which should be

797
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,219
monitored and and when the rule is

798
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,359
triggered

799
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,699
it's actually already too late

800
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,619
so that's why we suggest another

801
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,179
approach and that is to detect the

802
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,800
lateral movement and and the earlier

803
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,480
stages of the attack

804
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,240
so I'm guessing most of you are familiar

805
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
within packet so it's the soap and

806
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,540
Source framework with these

807
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,859
implementations of various Network

808
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,619
protocols in Python

809
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,540
um and there are these tools built on

810
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,940
top of this this framework and they're

811
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,859
used for remote execution and lateral

812
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:16,380
movement among other things and impact

813
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,500
is is impacted is heavily used by sand

814
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,980
worm especially this wmix Dot py

815
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,180
and we can detect when wmi prvsc XZ

816
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,619
spawns a new command XZ as this has this

817
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:36,960
specific command line that's being used

818
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,420
and as a bonus you can also use this

819
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,000
technique uh to detect other apts not

820
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,720
only sandworm

821
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,099
and xenover has also been using a custom

822
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:49,740
Powershell script that uh creates those

823
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,320
scheduled tasks uh via the Active

824
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,260
Directory Group Policy and there's a

825
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,700
whole dedicated miter attack sub

826
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,880
technique uh for this this these

827
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,380
scheduled tests and you can follow the

828
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,900
recommendations there to monitor for

829
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,359
specific event IDs

830
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,339
foreign

831
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,940
now as a side note

832
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,520
um something that that something to

833
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,079
think about so there's actually a

834
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,400
Metasploit client for IEC 104

835
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,500
and if the attackers

836
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,540
um would want to do carry out this whole

837
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,280
attack manually they could could have

838
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,940
just sent those asdu telegrams through a

839
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,540
remote shell using something like this

840
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,000
um so effectively what in destroyer and

841
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
this applies to both versions so what

842
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,000
it's doing is putting all this

843
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,540
capability in into a package

844
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,920
so the gist of the attack was

845
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,440
in the attacker's Deep knowledge of the

846
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,820
environment

847
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,040
um they knew the IPS they knew the

848
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,859
specific ioas to Target I mean as you've

849
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,740
seen in the configuration like they they

850
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,780
had them hard-coded they knew what they

851
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,359
were going after

852
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,640
and that brings me to the wrap for this

853
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,280
this industrial section of the talk

854
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,839
um here's some further reading for you

855
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,760
in case you're you're interested in more

856
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,820
details there's our blog posts on it uh

857
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,800
there are two good write-ups by mandya

858
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,720
and nozomi networks that provide nice

859
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,119
documentation of the industry to

860
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,400
configuration

861
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,079
and Joe slowik put out a white paper

862
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,359
that goes into detail on the physical

863
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,480
destruction goal in the industry 2016

864
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,400
incident

865
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,700
foreign

866
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,579
now all of this really is just the tip

867
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,200
of the iceberg as I mentioned several

868
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,240
times in the talk uh there were many

869
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
many more campaigns and and there were

870
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,820
many other attacks by both sandworm

871
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,640
and the other APC groups as well some of

872
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,740
which have also been attributed to

873
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,220
Russian three letter agencies

874
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,839
including the gru like sandwich but also

875
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,700
svr and the FSB

876
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,640
so for sand worm I showed the FBI

877
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,680
indictment and I wanna

878
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,260
spend a few minutes on another apt group

879
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,320
that scammer it on and for gamma red on

880
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,839
the the Ukrainian secret service the sbu

881
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,060
published details about them

882
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,660
um they're calling the group Armageddon

883
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,359
and this report from November 2021 is

884
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,560
really interesting

885
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,540
um and I strongly encourage you to read

886
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,020
it uh it's linking gamma rhodon to an

887
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,660
FSB unit operating out of occupied

888
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,880
Crimea

889
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,079
um and they're publishing a lot of

890
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,420
information about the actual people the

891
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,640
individuals behind this group their

892
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,579
roles uh and even some captured phone

893
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,579
calls that they were making during these

894
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,339
operations so this really gives us a

895
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,800
unique opportunity to hear about Gamma

896
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,440
red on or an apt group operations from

897
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,599
from the inside

898
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,320
thank you

899
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,079
now I'm not going to highlight any one

900
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:04,440
particular gamma radon campaign I just

901
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,020
want to point out how active the group

902
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,200
has been uh what they lack in

903
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,480
sophistication well at least compared to

904
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,300
sandworm uh they definitely make up for

905
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,960
in volume because we've been detecting

906
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,180
attacks by gammaridon almost on a daily

907
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,300
basis in the past couple of years

908
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,200
so this makes it by far uh the most

909
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,800
active apt group in Ukraine

910
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,300
um and their primary targets have been

911
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,640
government organizations

912
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,940
so they're literally spamming their

913
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,560
targets with

914
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,900
pretty low-tech malware

915
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,240
um their tool set is composed of

916
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,060
downloaders backdoors uh basically

917
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,280
multiple components executed in multiple

918
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,700
stages uh in various forms so they use

919
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,579
lnk files and there are archives VBS

920
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,040
scripts and and recently and and more

921
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,740
increasingly Powershell Scripts

922
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,040
so what's what's uh very specific to

923
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,780
gamma red on and and their tool set

924
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,339
which were track which we're calling as

925
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,599
Toronto

926
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,700
is that they're constantly updating

927
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,079
their tools

928
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,599
um it first of course in order to try to

929
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,180
avoid detection and also to make the

930
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,800
analysis more difficult more time

931
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,359
consuming

932
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,099
um but these changes they're they're

933
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,960
mostly superficial

934
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,359
um rather than functional so for example

935
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,680
they would add a lot of comments uh junk

936
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,500
code and stuff like that

937
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,660
um an example that we've seen recently

938
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,000
was that in order to avoid domain name

939
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,579
block lists uh gamma red on recently

940
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,520
started using a third-party service

941
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,859
ipapi.com for resolving the IP addresses

942
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,380
of its CNC servers instead of just using

943
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,880
regular DNS

944
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,460
in a similar manner some gammered on

945
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,280
tools were using telegram channels to

946
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,160
get the IP addresses of their command

947
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,118
and control servers

948
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,380
now in many instances we observed that

949
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,480
the victims that were compromised by

950
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,119
gammaridon were

951
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,000
let's say upgraded to a more

952
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,420
sophisticated and a much much stealthier

953
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,180
uh apt invisible

954
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,160
uh if they were considered by the

955
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,240
attackers

956
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,899
um interesting enough

957
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,760
so this is

958
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,420
really interesting uh collaboration to

959
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,880
what we are tracking as as separate apt

960
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,099
groups

961
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,579
so let's slowly wrap everything up

962
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:42,800
um

963
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,420
what is the role of these cyber

964
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,700
operations in in this arm conflict well

965
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,619
we can split it into two main objectives

966
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,500
the first being Espionage uh the the

967
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,720
covert the silent part and of course

968
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,420
depending on the target quite often

969
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,220
we've we've been seeing diplomatic

970
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,500
military organizations being targeted

971
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,619
that can provide strategic or technical

972
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,099
advantage in in the conflict

973
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,780
um and then the second type of impact

974
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,940
was was sabotage

975
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,040
um disruption destruction

976
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,079
and also just purely signaling a

977
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,020
demonstration of of power of these

978
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,440
attackers

979
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,920
now

980
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,500
there has been a lot of discussions

981
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,260
about the effectiveness of this and and

982
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,000
comparing it to you know the kinetic

983
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,740
operations and

984
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,720
um for multiple reasons I'd be really

985
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,640
careful about evaluating the magnitude

986
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,980
and the success rate of these Russian

987
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,480
cyber operations

988
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,099
um in Ukraine

989
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,859
um it's great that both both the

990
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,420
industrial attacks

991
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,760
um have ultimately failed their goals

992
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,960
but still some damage has been caused um

993
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,160
so

994
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,260
all in all I would say that the thread

995
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,060
should not be hyped

996
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,160
but also conversely it should not be

997
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,640
downplayed and or underestimated we can

998
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,619
say that the threats are serious but

999
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,359
they can be thwarted with proper

1000
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,460
security measures

1001
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,900
um

1002
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,000
what I'm trying to say with with all the

1003
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,880
in Destroyer 2 implementation and all of

1004
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,000
that the threat actor sophistication

1005
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,520
is not really in the malware writing in

1006
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,000
itself I mean it's not using any any

1007
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,160
fancy obfuscation and stuff like that it

1008
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,859
really is in the intimate knowledge of

1009
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,240
the protocols that Target in an

1010
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,920
environment they really knew what they

1011
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,140
were going after

1012
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,780
and finally based on the experience that

1013
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,060
that we've had seeing these these

1014
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,380
operations

1015
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,240
um we can say that the defense needs to

1016
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,819
focus on early detection and prevention

1017
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,619
so

1018
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,500
we've been publishing the iocs uh even

1019
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,560
in this talk I included some examples of

1020
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,560
of detection opportunities but most of

1021
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,140
those approaches really are reactive so

1022
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,660
to stay ahead of these attackers you

1023
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,420
need to have endpoint security platforms

1024
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,380
EDR and and the typical

1025
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,099
typical Security Solutions in place

1026
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:13,319
so that's it for today

1027
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,760
um if you're interested in following on

1028
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,880
our research and you haven't done so I

1029
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,760
uh invite you to follow us on the wheel

1030
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,099
of security which is our blog post and

1031
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,599
our uh Twitter account uh ESET research

1032
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,420
uh here are my contact details and let's

1033
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,859
open up for some questions if there are

1034
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:32,900
any thank you

1035
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:41,769
