good afternoon good afternoon good afternoon our next exponent comes from the neighboring country of Chile he is a great friend of mine he is a consultant in social engineering awareness with a degree in representation arts with certification and social engineering retim and osim Team leader of friendry rats the social engineering unit of  Dream las Technology in Chile one of the best Hello one of the best field social engineers in South America and in the last seven years he has specialized in advanced social engineering techniques and tools everything that is physical introduction and mixed vectors and today it comes to us  with his talk drag us to wonderbatt a tale of How to be good people capturing credentials and 2 fa that he presented it previously in defcon no good with you Daniel isler applause please Thank you Well the first thing is to tell you that this paper was a work of several years  field work And we started looking for references if someone had done  or something similar Then we came across this video of Kevin midnik and his team where they effectively captured credentials and second factor authentication from linkedin and we thought [ __ ] the greatest social engineer in history already did it, it doesn't make sense to do this paper now but then we remember the  greatest social engineer in history curiously if you don't know it is a mouse his name is Timothy the mouse who was able to convince a group of professional scammers perhaps it still doesn't sound like they will reveal their biggest secret like this and he also managed to convince an elephant to  that could fly Here I go with this if you have already seen or listened to some of our talks you will understand that our main objective is to achieve the greatest reach using the minimum exploitation of a vector with high consequences but that can be exploited by anyone like Timothy through  This presentation we intend to explain to you is a way and with Obviously with fine  s educational and awareness especially how anyone could eventually capture credentials and second factor of authentication of one of the most used email clients in the world only with social engineering we will meet the team that worked behind the scenes the first is the  Mr. Conradstein, who will also be known as the Caterpillar, he helps us develop the necessary tools for the execution of all our services. Afterwards, he is in 1000, who is a magician and publicist who will officiate as the March hare, his compatriot Carolina Crespo, an electronic engineer.  and social engineering office that leads all our fitting and smitching services and that is the perfect example of but if he looked so kind César Soto a simple guy as he says of the field but with advanced knowledge in retina infrastructure a perfect profile which nobody  I would like to have within your network and finally I Daniel or splinter  or rat whatever you want to call me but this time I will be the White Rock Beat I am the team leader of friendly roth the social engineering unit of dreamblab technologies Let's start with some facts it is important to see certain agreements or what happens with us When we do services say security for example  a reptile when we literally open the doors for privilege escalation or lateral movements or even remote control of equipment What happens to us cider criminal attackers They usually buy It is not true they get those links and use them against their victim what we cannot  to do because we have to report them and we can't use them because otherwise we would be being accomplices of those who steal this information they supplant registered trademarks without any problem obviously they are not going to worry about that we cannot do that because there is a legal scope to which we  we face I know that it depends  From each country, fittings from your company in the name of Microsoft probably arrive here. I don't know if Microsoft is going to be happy with that, but not in all countries you can do that, they specifically choose who they want to attack, yes, and they don't have any filters, no.  there is no one from human resources who is going to say no to those people, not in this case.  there is nothing to stop them if they see that your child has a disease and with that you are going to click the link then guess what they are going to use obviously we do that because the context obviously has to do with evidence and an ethical context Yes then  There begins the paradox that we are preparing our people so much and it is a bit we are going to talk today. They have months of preparation nine months 12 months we understand or know of some m  anera In how long the last apts were created, we differ from them, we only have two weeks to have exactly the same reach or more and having to report everything, they have no problem making fake profiles, contacting people, befriending them, asking for information because  there is no moral or ethical scope obviously we cannot do that and we can only go overboard with information extracted from open sources I have already said it countless times there is no morality there is no ethics in the attack for us it is not a service we have to strengthen the people  we have to teach them not to do that So Wow How to get the same range without having those in quotes advantages let's see it then I think it's time to transform into the rat permission today there yes it is heard true yes you can change the voice a bit  So one of our great goals is to have the same findings as the criminals.  Many times, perhaps even you will find it ridiculous or impossible or that only movies happen. This type of finding I mean passwords exposed voluntarily to the public, yes, the photo of a critical device unlocked with its visible IP, nothing that does not happen, it is not.  true Well when I name this many probably immediately think of the Deep web the links or the bottle of Alicia saying Take me but as we have already seen we cannot do the same as criminals Yes what we do social networks Wow Facebook Yes my granny uses it I don't know if  It helps me to reach critical infrastructure, so let's look for another perfect Instagram network, but more and more profiles are private and we can't access that information. We know that people in the Data Center take photos but their profile is private and we can't access that information, so  a and the proportion of Instagram gives a lot of information it does not give us what we want to find then someone arrives  n a friend of ours And where to look for tinder I told the cat yes tinder look Let's start with the basic elements of tinder it is an application that works thanks to geolocation geolocation that otherwise many of you even have activated now is the grace of the  application I need to meet someone here here or not then with that possibility of geolocation that I can even select because today we can say that we are in another place to find a partner in another country and even more so the proportion to find those findings that Instagram does not give us no  they think me good due to the nature of this application most of the profiles Seeks to make an excellent first impression we understand that it is one of the basic rules of social engineering if we do not have second chances for a first impression So which nestlings show their best plumage in  the network my position my credential my team yes tinder does not ring a bell see  a little bit [Music] believe it or not in countries as large as Argentina there are industries that occupy blocks around and tinder allows you to limit the spectrum in kilometers to that sector So if I want to find the access credential to make a replica I just have to  search there I know that you also think about this the cat OK But that only serves you for physical access credentials said Chester's cat sure I told him I'm going to see [Music] hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello  hello hello hello hello hello [Music] hello hello hello hello hello hello many are probably questioning what all those people were thinking when they put an unlocked desktop an unlocked team on tinder they are human That is the answer we need that we need to belong we need to be accepted let's go with  the first chapter Who are you the chapter of The Caterpillar target profiling for the creation of a conv  encourage the preparation of effective vectors and exploitation of vulnerabilities essential to know our target perfectly with a decent submint we can find uniform workstations identifications critical and sensitive information or protocols and means of access now it is time to profile the targets but How will you get to  the right ones asked the Caterpillar in the last decade a paradigm has been established that everyone knows a paradigm used by IT leaders and that many times they use it as a shield to protect themselves to blame the user Yes instead of taking charge of that training take charge  of that education that is what we are going to see today when we let time go by to teach someone that they should not do something and it happens in those things then the caterpillar asked and who are we to look for Although it sounds paradoxical we managed to identify three large groups to  which we use as targets in the  The services of the first is the yes Level, its assistants and secretaries exclaimed the caterpillar, it is true, this happens, confesses many Tiny leaders for fear of bothering or bothering the yes Level, so they are not invited or included in the awareness sessions, making them a target  easy to reach the second team is critical Aries are you serious said the caterpillar Yes, since with the owl that perhaps they can feel alluded to that they already know they ask not to be included in the security tests because they already know So the ego becomes  something very powerful and especially a great weakness and the last group that is the one we like the most for this test recently hired staff Oh how much I adore them and their posts the linkedin don boarding to those who brag about their cute teleworking setups said the  caterpillar That's right caterpillar excess information makes them excellent targets That's right So how attackers and simulators co  We started our collection in Open Sources but for that they already have a lot of Austin stories I'm late A joke is coming we are not we are not many companies use the same user credentials for more than one service in the case of small and medium-sized companies Generally they are the  same credentials for all right medium small companies many medals and small companies are here this makes them an excellent gateway for the attacker we have a call [Music] How could we request this information without raising alerts asked the Hatter the first thing is to create a  person Put with me The hat said I hope I told him in this case we will use a vector called between webcam which is basically a phone call accompanied by a malicious site And how do we contact the target asked the Hatter impersonating internal support How funny the Hatter laughs once it is done  the call is from V  It is very important to have all the necessary information at hand, a well-rehearsed support script with its possible variants and above all, as Christopher Hattnaggy says, make them feel good about having met you, you have to be a solution to their problems, for that we will do the following to create a  the person or if you have validated by the client the impersonation of an internal department must master the technical language even if you have associated knowledge I recommend you interview someone who works in support ask them about routine queries recurring failures common jokes transversal solutions protocols and while you interview them  take note of their demeanor their fillers the type of laugh their inflections Have a keyboard handy because it will help you fill in the gaps and Set a believable environment avoid raising you as a Muppet that could lead to distrust in a dedicated player in a dedicated player and hear me out  in a reproduce  exclusive tor can include white or office sound in a constant Loop remember an exclusive player for that and if you use a cell phone leave it in airplane mode and without WiFi believe me it is just in those moments when voice message notifications are activated and the second 0033 of  the song Paradise by Coldplay yes together with all of the above we are going to prepare a fake support site based on the internal logins detected in the recognition stage of the service this will start with a login with restrictions of only user at The domain of the support company.  com.ar and minimum passwords of the company's policy, in this case, if they do not know it, 8 or 10 characters will be enough to force the target to include real information. An extra element that we have that was designed by Mr. Caterpillar is  a Bot that sends us the information entered so we immediately have the blogs of the page and we don't have to go looking for them c  opiate paste and we are not late Let's start with the simulation It's about time boring grumbled the Hatter let's assume hatter that you are an employee who has just been hired and has just uploaded a post to linkedin with her bomb and you receive a call [Music] she is  Argentina Hello hatter I'm Alicia from technical support and murmuring very well thank you very briefly hatter I was just calling you to see if you already have access to the support portal hesitating and murmuring the support portal we can validate it immediately enter the support site www company name  .com.ar when you enter you confirm me a moment ago let's analyze the construction and the elements of persuasion that you have just witnessed perhaps imperceptible but this allows us in each exercise in each simulation to obtain valid passwords and double authentication factor Hello hatter this is in no case  a question is an assertion a winning bet this eliminates the possibility  Whether it is a sale of a service or a call from a stranger, the target must feel your trust and even believe that you know him just by making sure of his name and a greeting. I am Alicia from support. How are you? It is important that this be followed up.  by combining the question with the short presentation, the question of whether or not he knows you, the question will be answered cordially Very well, thank you, perhaps after answering about his status, he will ask you again who you are and where you are calling from, but that is something that already  you solved and he knows it very briefly hatter in this case it is not necessary to use a time range to establish an expectation agreement since it will be canceled immediately always use his name Write it very visible in front of you we use blackboards I only called you to know what remains  all value to time and gives value to the closed response of the target The idea is to install in the mind of the target that the purpose and duration  ion of this call sakota still yes or no if you already have access to the support portal a question is established, being you the solution and the answer as we know is a false portal so there is a high probability that the answer is no what it is  very good since you are the immediate solution we can validate it immediately We are the solution and the objective should only follow us everything will be fine enter the support site at the end of this sentence a pause of no more than two seconds to install the doubt in  the head of the individual without him being able to verbalize any word of doubt or denial since you will give him the answer by installing a figure of trust and knowledge www dot the name of the company soporte.com.ar when you enter you confirm me according to your firewall rules  or VPN you could encounter some problems that you would even have to request new actions such as switching to the WiFi network, deactivating the VPN service or  even asking him to enter the portal from his cell phone and not the corporate team, it is important that you be flexible that you adapt to the reality of each objective and do not force him to comply with a rigid script, remember that you are supportive if up to now you have been convincing and projected security  You should be receiving notifications from the logs with the data entered and your heart beginning to beat a thousand beats per second. You must try to hide it in the call. Congratulations, you have graduated as social engineers. You obtained a valid username and credential, but let's remember Kevin and Las  Session cookies from a social network now Let's bet higher we capture the second factor email authentication And therefore all the services associated with it so we will graduate as social engineers Syria let's go back to the hatter entering credentials the March hare to create the fake  support portal we analyze all sites with  n domains in the name of the client in this way we were able to replicate an identical or familiar-looking login for the user they look awake he is entering his credentials said the march hare during recognition we were able to determine if the second authentication factor was a button or a code he said  the dormouse So when the Hatter clicks on enter a new screen is displayed with a Time out which gives the dormouse time to copy and paste the credentials in the login tells me to validate the application And yes please validate the application ok No  nothing happens wake up the March hare while the time out counts down the dormouse wakes up all the credentials you enter them and you are asked to validate in the application Oh yes I was able to unlock said the perfect Hatter let's wait a few seconds until the page loads now  I'm inside says the Hatter proudly the March hare and the dormouse celebrate Alice contains em  otion and sticks to the script the March hare and the dormouse already graduates of social engineering have full access to the user's account Meanwhile the user accesses the fake support portal Alice holding back her excitement says excellent here you could find everything you need to raise  a ticket or make any type of support query have a great day See you later and thank you very much you were very kind let's recap public information the linkedin of new hires the targets are selected people who have only been three days six days where you already know  Your operating system The equipment you are using How are you going to doubt someone who calls you who knows that you have just been hired and has that computer that operating system with that position and with that boss who put you in? We got contact through open sources We created the portal  false for the user to access and while accessing we manage to have the credentials  and the second authentication factor with this we not only already have access to an internal information service, but also with the password entered there is a high probability of deciphering hacked passwords with Session Cookies Alicia and her friends maintain access to mail and associated services for months  Since it was a new contract, no alerts were raised and the credentials were not renewed and colorín Colorado I hope this does not continue today, questions, do you have any questions for Daniel, here he has the microphone here, go ahead, I know you want to bring them closer or you can bring them closer, raise your hand  Come on, don't be shy, don't be afraid, that's the topic, I'm not sure, you have the mask over there, you want to ask the mouse a question.  he can go to the social engineering space that we are here in front of room c1 and well One  pause a round of applause for Daniel isler thank you thank you for being here and now I will show you the next slide it's only 30 seconds as you know today is November 2nd it's the Day of the Dead they probably don't celebrate it here but for me it's very important and we all have a  dead that accompanies us so I wanted to say a greeting for all the dead that we all have in health [Music] when I die of you I want a kiss from you and a crown of flowers, my darling, don't cry My life that I take you
