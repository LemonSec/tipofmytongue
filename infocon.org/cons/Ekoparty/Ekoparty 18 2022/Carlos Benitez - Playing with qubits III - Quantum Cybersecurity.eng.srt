[Music] [Music] well how are you Good afternoon Thank you for being here and let's start a little who am I first this very simple I had like four lives and in the last life only the last 25 years I'm in computer security in cybersecurity this something Quite a lot  important thing that I wanted to clarify is my day to day is the same as yours and I am dealing with viruses malware siemens risk analysis security ISO nist And then you will say And then this guy has to do with quantum because this band is talking nothing more than  That's why because I'm a fan of quantum I love the subject of quantum I had people who explained to me and taught me the things that can be done with quantum I'm seeing everything that's happening in quantum lately and I started to study and  try to understand what can be done Yes, if you pay attention, let's talk a little about numbers, just take a look How investment is skyrocketing in the world  or on issues related to quantum This is this is a statistic only for startups in the United States Look at the speed at which investment is skyrocketing, a lot of money is being put in, it has its consequences, we are also going to see some of the consequences it is putting in and  They are also getting a lot of money, now we are going to see why, but there is a lot, as we said, there is a lot of hype. I suppose everyone knows what High means, is to make hype, is to exaggerate things in some cases, the quantum if it is going to generate problems or it is going to generate benefits.  In other cases, it is not yet known, I am not going to say that it is going to do it or that it is not going to do it, simply that the elements are not yet available to know if it is known or not. But there are people who are selling and are taking advantage of doing business with this  Ok, well, another one of the graphs that I wanted to show you regarding numbers is, look, who is the one that is investing the most, we are going to do a little more  big this in this in quantum in recent years yes And this is only the Chinese state is investing that amount of money Regarding the states of other countries only regarding state investments in China they are investing very heavily alibabasta issuing very strongly vaidu  that it is a search engine, the movement that has taken place in these last two years is tremendous, quantum, so, well, you have to get on it, you have to at least understand what is happening, you have to at least understand what we can do with it, OK, well, I'm going to  say now because surely they are going to kick me out they are going to say there are five minutes left when I am halfway through the talk and I am not going to get the thanks at the end so I want to mainly thank the Eco Party because it is the third time they have let me  talking about this here the other two is quite rare this one is streaming now luckily in person So many thanks to the echo Party for allowing  go tell all this and very special thanks to two people Luciano bello who accompanied me in the first two talks solution both are doctors Yes One is a doctor you did computing another doctor in mathematics Luciano bello works in the IBM laboratory in Zurich is one  from the developers of the kisskit framework, which is the freeware with which you interact with IBM quantum computers. Yes, he taught me, he showed me a lot of things, he also gave me access to some things to do tests, and Fernando birdia, who knew him at Eco, knew him  in the Eco of 2020 he is a doctor in mathematics who is specialized is a writer and is specialized in everything that is post quantum cryptography and he nourished me a lot also this one broke this I tell you just in case this helped me a lot in the things I am going  I am going to tell you something also important that I am going to tell you is the things that I am going to tell you, as I told you, I am also from security work.  jo on security issues I am this technical advisor of the cyberdefense undersecretariat I have a couple of this I founded a couple of companies this they confused a couple of cybersecurity companies and I work in cybersecurity but I give this talk in a totally personal name Ok it's just mine I'm not here  Representing nobody and the opinions that are going to be half intertwined by Fernando's Luciani are also personal assets.  I am going to tell you quickly in two minutes what we saw in the previous talks, one was the concepts of quantum computing The talk that was given in 2020 was about concepts of quantum computing, so we were talking about the difference between the qubit, today we are not going to  Let's see within the things that I am going to tell, I am not going to express it specifically, we show a little how the things are  Quantum computers that exist today and that are being used today and that are being developed are quite different from classical computers and what we showed that Lucía showed I don't remember Dodge's algorithm Dodge's algorithm working on a quantum computer  it is the Hello work of quantum it is an algorithm that the only thing it does is demonstrate that a quantum computer can do different things and solve faster than a classical computer I am not saying that it is faster because that confuses it is not that it is faster what  It does differently, yes, it does the same thing at night, simply Showing that an operation that in a classic motor Yes or yes, it has to be done with two operations in a quantum one, is done with just one, that's ok in last year's Eco we showed the short algorithm  the short algorithm that we are going to talk about a little bit now is also the algorithm that once it is implemented will break with  public key cryptography is going to break with RCA it is going to break with this one with elliptic curves it is going to break with difigelman That is, if someone is capturing encrypted information with some of those algorithms the day they have a quantum computer with certain characteristics what will  to do is you will be able to find the key and you will be able to decipher all the messages Ok well what we are going to see today we are going to see today is this a little bit of concepts and quantum techniques that are going to affect our world the world of  cybersecurity for better or for worse and more or less in what state is each one of them?  that people have that might not be this valid But because they entered their heads because someone told them a certain way one of the concepts that entered their heads  of people in a certain way and that it is not correct is this what is this what is this Schrödinger's cat to be able to explain what the concept of superposition is like when he was developing quantum theory the example of Schrödinger's cat occurs to him I'm not going to  to count is quite long it is quite complex but the basic concept of the crying cat is that I don't know if I have the cat inside a box I don't know if the cat is alive or dead until I open the box Ok That's it  basically the concept of Geraldine's cat It turns out that with that concept I told him that it generates a lot of trouble Yes and a lot of mistakes we are going to count some of them now because I want you to focus later on What is the most real concept of what  What does quantum superposition mean? That is what Jordinger said, that is to say, if I have a qubit in a state of superposition, I have the same chances that the cat is alive and that the cat is dead at  at the same time Ok the cat is alive and dead at the same time Ok good but there are some small errors The small mistake you make trading is what is the example that the cat states use the cat is alive or dead forget about ones and zeros now  Is he alive or is he dead, what does that mean when I open the box and read the cat, what I'm going to do is collapse it to one or zero, alive or dead, it's a state that if it gets to be in one of those states, I'll go back to  put the cat overlay and it changes back So I can do this I can go from alive to dead I can I can yes Ok I can do this I can't So the concept of the cat alive and dead life and death is something that people  it stays in his head and he says Wow he's alive and he's dead Bye ready he put a wrong concept in people's heads Yes the cat It's not that he's alive or and dead he's not alive and dead the term is wrong that concept Ok that's one  of the problems  s what Geraldine's cat has the other problem that the English cat has what he says is I will not know if the cat is alive or dead until I open the box so very very intelligent people began to think and say the box is  there it is always there I am not going to know if the box has a live dead cat until I open it And who opens it a consciously quantum conscious person and a Nobel Prize winner appears a guy who is not a fool yes Roger Penrose had a Nobel Prize  a few years ago on the topic the work on black holes it turns out that it creates a concept to say Ok if someone conscious is needed to know if a quantum state is going to collapse as a zero there is a relationship between consciousness and quantum and he turned it around and said  then in the brain there must be quantum processes OK Why Because the only way to know if a cat is alive or dead is for someone not to open it if it is the only way to know if a ulna is in one or e  n zero is that someone consciously looks at it there is a relationship of course conscience versus good Fantastic from that a wave was generated that I cannot tell you It was more until a couple of weeks ago If you saw the conferences here in Buenos Aires there was a conference  about quantum consciousness yes I don't know if any of you have gone if you want if any of you went please see you later I want to chat with him What happened Where does the concept come from the only way to know if the cat is alive dead the only way to know  if the ulna is one at zero it is for someone to see it consciously Ok What happened a few years later the coherence appeared they discovered the concept of coherence What does that mean that there are a lot of interactions between the particle that I want to measure and the environment that  It could be noise, it could be this temperature, it could be the collision with other particles, the collision with the same photons that make the cubic collapse than the photon.  or that the particle collapses So what does that mean that it is not the only option it is not that a person consciously has to open the box he has to measure the cubit ok So that throws the other one to the ground well no no that was a few years after the  dog in 1965 spoke of quantum consciousness not quantum consciousness accompanies us to this day and will continue until the last of the days Ok well another mistake Ok it is not a person who has to read a qubit to know if that qubit is in  one or at zero Ok That is the correct concept Ok That is the correct concept the guinea pig has two classical states 0 and 1 and at the moment in which it is in superposition it is somewhere in between with some probability and that depends on the operations that  we are doing ok it is there is the way to represent it is with the Blog Sphere in which I have a vector pointing up that has a zero a vector pointing down that I have in one and  the state of Super questions to any other infinite point of the Sphere depending on what I am doing there.  10 I will never be able to know the quantum state, I will only know the classical state once I read it Ok well, this is how a superposition cubic is built, this is one of those of the quirky one Well, actually of the IBM composer the necro I put  at 0 an ulna and then a behavior happens to it Mari the only thing I do is rotate the vector I told it in the other talks So I'm not going to come here with this but this is what is real about life and death and opening the  box and all that forget it ok I know it's hard to forget a concept When it first entered in a certain way but forget it well the other important concept for what we are going to see later is understandably or confusion which is the term  More this correct in Spanish that you can find is when I have somehow I can generate two qubits that are linked together in tangled tangler How is this done Normally it is done through a laser This is one way of doing it I pass again has  a laser and I put two plates that are polarized one vertically and the other horizontally and when the photons come out of there some photons intertwined with each other will come out. What does it mean that these two photons are somehow connected to each other And what happens to it  It will happen to one to the other like the twins saw that when a twin is in two different parts of the world and one gets sick, the other also gets sick and those strange things that you see on the cable channels, well, this effect  It's the one that Einstein went crazy when he started studying incest, it can't be, it can't be because there isn't one, they can't connect with each other here, speed they connect p  because on top of that it is instantaneous at the speed greater than light it cannot be anything a speed greater than light can be connected There can be no transmission beyond the speed of light Einstein called this Spooky action ateristant a spooky action the  distance between those two elements Yes good And he said this can't be this is wrong and Einstein got together with powers that with rosen they made a paper that says quantum theory is incomplete here a variable is missing in the middle it's all wrong if I put it in mode  in tanglemen two qubits in different states there is a variable that is missing in the middle and it cannot be in the newspapers of the time it came out here Einstein attacks quantum theory and I am very amused by what the scientist and two colleagues say reminds me they remember  That that Chronicle headline that said two people and a Bolivian.  Well, we don't know what it's like, but it's fine, it works like this. This then, John Bell takes over and begins to develop and tries to try to see how to demonstrate that this was valid and they fight there, Einstein sells one side of the other to the point  de quebel ends up beating Einstein after Einstein died with the paper in which he explains and worst of all, he explains it with classical statistical probability yes easy and understandable for them Ok easy and understandable for them Then the engliment is  understand that it works it can be produced and used in fact it is used these are then superposition in tanglemen are the two most important properties that we are going to see now in the tangamen it is produced in this way if you pay attention What is the result the result is  that the two particles are at zero or at one, they are not really two particles, it is only one that can be at 0011, it is only one. In fact, there is one, we are talking to one of the c  Guys from the previous talk, there is one of the theories that says that it is not really that these two particles are in tangled, they are not two particles, but rather there is only one that exists in two places at the same time, so when I touch one, it touches the other.  That is what allows us to do what is called quantum communication, but we are going to demystify quantum communication a bit. Let's also start with the four techniques that I told you we were going to show. Let's see quantum computing. Quantum computing. We already saw a lot in the talks.  So I'm just going to do it quickly I just want you to have these considerations Remember that in a quantum program when you want to develop a quantum algorithm and take it to a quantum computer what you are really creating is a circuit it is not a program it is not a sequence of  steps like a classic computer They create a circuit yes from a number of qubits those that are seen there from the cruise ship  a q12 they are all cubes they are real they are devices that are on a chip the ones that are being used the most and with which I have been working this through obviously through the page mm No, well I never saw them they are based on superconductors there are  many different types of qubits that can be generated those that are based on Super conductors are the ones that are more developed and more controlled so on those what I do is do things yes make it count Ok and at a certain point when they finish all that sequence of counts  What I do is read the Coby and when I read it, what happens, does it go to one or go to zero?  the wave function This and that and that one that zero is going to depend on all the things I did before okay that is one of the topics the other topic like that one and zero depends on probabilities in the idea state  l I have 50 50 percent for abilities but when I start applying gates to it and it starts doing things to it it might have a 60% 40 percent chance of 60% of being a 140 out of 0 So what will be the result of my operation  if I run it just once I have a 60% probability that it will give me one 40 that it will give me 0 then you can give me one you can do and what is the correct result I cannot know if I do it just once I have to do it many times  to see what the histogram is that gives me so I say Ah well in this case for example the result is operations 1110 OK Because it is the one that gave me the greatest number but I can't do it just once is another important consideration of  quantum computing another important consideration is this when you see all those gates here they are not the logic gates of electronics that one remembers that they put one here plus one here if it is an Ana here she will give me a one  No, it is not that type of gate, that is a mathematical extraction, which in reality is an electromagnetic pulse with a certain shape that gives it the behavior of the gate that I want to apply, we will also explain this from the other time, if I have a sequence of  gates what I am doing is applying a sequence of pulses to reach a result the issue is that this sequence that you eject are very very short the quantum states last a very short time So I have to apply the next one this the next gate the next pulse before  before it collapses or before the quantum state of the guinea pig I'm working on is lost.  I don't have the slightest idea of ​​what happens inside, that is, I intuit it, I calculate it, but I have no way of measuring it at the moment that I gave myself anything and  inside 10 bye all the state of the devil is gone Ok so when you build a quantum algorithm what you have to have are all those things in your head yes I have to put together something so that I can test it to check that the result is indeed  The one that I want is left for later, obviously, I will give you the data, this one that I do not know well. What things cannot be done with quantum computing and some will laugh when what it shows now, but later they will realize that it is not there.  One thing I can't do is an enema, for example, with a quantum computer I can't do it, that is, how many times did you run for four and a half days to see a couple of servers to see what open ports they had then, daughter, great if I with a quantum computer  can do everything at once yes all simultaneously let's do an enema with a quantum computer no it can't Why can't it because simultaneity occurs at  inside the computer above the cubit when I left I went to the classic state and it doesn't work anymore I'm back in the classic state ok another thing I can't do is not look for vulnerabilities either I want to look for all the vulnerabilities of one of the entire library that  I even have the application and I have the pentecost in 30 microseconds the same exact same case you can't do that ok you can't but huh someone is selling it someone is selling how much a penetration testing is impossible this when I was talking about the hype and  of the people who are spending a lot of money because now quantum is fashionable and you have to be in quantum and you have to do things be careful with this do not fall for the deception ok well let's see what can be done yes what can be done  can do is break break the Only with the largest algorithm can be done, that is, it has been shown that it can be done, what has not been done yet is because there is still no computer  now quantum big enough to do it But the day the quantum computer is big enough they're going to break everything they have this with the algorithm of short the speed of to find from a key of let's say the text of the public key to find the private key  Is this I mean it doesn't matter if I double multiply by 10 the number of bits I'm going to put is logarithmic they'll find the key right away I mean it can't be used no more it's not going to be used difficult hellman  never again OK the moment that happens fine What is the advantage then of The short algorithm and yes it is in relation to the classic and all Yes there is a 10 because there is no there is no With what to give it I mean it will break it What is it  the level of maturity is still low because it takes more or less 6,000 a 6000 cubit machine 6000 cubits to break a 2048-bit RCA algorithm with superconductors beware that there are many ways to do c  ubic and other machines that use more others that use less let's talk about superconductors and Today we are in the order of 100, that is, there is still something else that is going to be able to break, but a little, as can be seen there, it is aes with Grover's algorithm the  Grover's algorithm is a search algorithm in a messy database that does very strange things we were talking about this with Los Chicos before that quantum is a totally counterintuitive thing Don't ask me because I still didn't understand it but the drugger's algorithm is certain  moment he gives you an answer before you ask him and that's how it is look for the explanations and you'll see that it works like this It's something totally crazy but it has a slightly slower speed Yes and its curve is different So I'm there yes I am  using several of 128 and I say Well no from now on we all use 256 sometimes even with a good quantum computer of 3000 cubits that is, I am closer because I need less  s cubits for that no no I will not be able to find it I mean there are 128 it will break those 56 it will not break well those are things that can be done something else that can be done in quantum computing  It's machine learning, more or less, let's see, it's Quantum Neural Networks, that is, I'm going to talk about two that you have to have and Super Vector Machine. The only thing that has been proven so far is that it's possible to run on a quantum computer.  it is possible to run a neural network it seemed the classic one is similar because there is a terrible problem which is when you have a neural network what you are doing is going through the different neurons and copying the states from one layer to the other of a  law to another in quantum there is what is called Well there are many no but the no cloning theorem of no copy in quantum is impossible physically impossible to copy a quantum state you can not I have a cubit that I processed it l  or I processed and it says 50 rotations and it says operations and whatever and I say Well this cubicle I want to put this same state yes I want to pass it here and then do an operation That is impossible to do if it cannot be done then the neural network is not  It doesn't exactly work exactly like a classical neural network. Ok, there is a kind of tree that is built in which operations are transferred and carried out, and what it has is that the speed at which a quantum neural network runs is almost the same as the  that this is a classic there is not much progress there so far at least all I am saying is until today Ok until today the level of maturity is a little higher because they have been working and they are doing things on that and they are doing tests  the other is the super vector Machine Support vector Machine is one is a generic classifier they call it in quantum they call it Quantum kernel Machine because what a super vector does  r Machine seba García I'm sure you remember your proofreader machine when it came in handy for the people of the bod this [Music] what it does is that Strange group of data that is very separated like this it generates functions called kernels that what they do are  Actually, hyperplanes. Rather, they are functions that transform the space from a circular space to that other space, and what I do through a hyperplane is to separate the two, the two groups of data. So he classified the data, they are binary classifiers. Well, yes  they can be run with machines there is a part that is the calculation of the Fisher space of the characteristic spaces that it is very difficult to make a classical computer with the quantum so it can be done in that portion they work and they work more or less well  ok that is one of the most advanced things that the theme of this quantum machine machines has Ok and here this is I leave it to you I would like that next year or  the other one, come someone and tell what else he did in quantum computers, you have to study a lot, eh, you have to study a lot, you have to understand it, I don't understand it, for example, many of them had a teacher in high school who said, I'm going to explain this to you so you don't understand it.  understand Well I am explaining all this to you so that you do not understand it above there are a lot of crossed things if you are interested read a paper and you understood it perfectly in another paper to which it refers and says something totally opposite in quantum So you have  to draw your own conclusions well we leave quantum computing let's go to cryptography well quantum this is a whole subject post quantum cryptography is still today if it comes the algorithm no longer exists and it can be run I don't have a 6000 cube machine to be able to break this RCA  OK But one day that's going to happen So the day it happens the people who were capturing encrypted data and who have tons of  discs with data, yes, a quantum computer will run it, and it will be able to return absolutely everything.  from fly I get fly is a very, very renowned cryptographer in the world who works in quantum cryptography well, quantum what he says is this if I have to save my data for a period x ok and I have to y is the transition period from today until  the moment in which they are going to be this list I will be ready to change my enrollment algorithms I threw out all RCA and started with makelis for example no that is one of the algorithms and z is the time to implement short what will happen at the moment  which is simply short everything from there to the back everything you have saved will reveal all the emails in which they said this Who killed Kennedy or Who killed Martin Luther King or where is Wa  lly all of those are going to be revealed Ok everyone is going to know this Who are they at that moment So what do I have to do I have to adopt post quantum cryptography now so that my secrets are at least kept for the period in which they should be kept  that is what the fly theorem says Ok the reality is that So what does the nis do is Open a competition and say Che they start throwing out algorithms that cannot be deciphered with a quantum computer start and start testing them and start  to publish it then Open open a contest that is not a contest Well a topic a semantic discussion there to see what it means What is the level of responsibility that the start has in that but it says all these algorithms we will go to those who come out finalists  We are going to normalize them so that they start using them. Ok, in fact, now I think that next week the other will come in the fourth round because the algorithms are happening.  We go from round to round and they are all killing themselves to find which are the organisms that are going to end up being standardized later, they have to be implemented and then start to do the whole process of change and start to change everything, all of RCA for the new algorithms OK Well yes  Look there it is kind of small well look there they have bike makelise the one I told them hqc and sike Ok they published this a couple of weeks ago and the next day it broke the nose because they are algorithms that were stored around there that nobody ever used  tested And now all of a sudden they say Che for all this would be algorithms that can be used in quantum constructographies let's start testing them and let's start to see if it works or not but they have been testing for two years Yes then it comes they are doing it in a hurry they are doing it with the  pressure that they have to release it that they have to release the standard then nothing comes someone sitting at their home PC and  in an hour with a PC it does not break an algorithm Pos quantum Ok well on the other hand these things appear not as I was saying a lot of hype people who are spending a lot of money buying things that are useless look what cuprotec says is a company that  It is the responsibility of the United States government eh 100% standard you see and Player include birthdays if they are going to come out next week they are already selling this Ok they are already selling all the scheme that post quantum receives and what they do is within  What the network does is encrypt information and the registration of information is done based on post-quantum algorithms and they sell them a fortune of equipment that we don't know if it's going to work. I'm not saying no but we don't know if it's going to work, for example.  It's broken because sites were implemented. They went well. Let's go now to quantum cryptography and there I ask the room if I have to put a cube in a perfect state of knowledge.  rposition I am going to read that cube and I have a 50 percent chance of being at 1 and 50% at zero and as long as I maintain the temperature and all that history I will always have that what can I do with that cube every time I read it it is in  one or at zero or at one or at 0 there is 50% what that ulna can be used for me How Random exactly very well how much Random lambers generators Ok great great if I grab one it's better better this random data source is perfect for that If it's  well implemented how to do it Well the same the mirrors here are different it is a translucent mirror here and half of the time it goes to one side half of the time it goes to the other and here they have how many and these Chinese who  They are already selling these products that come out in the order of thousands of dollars against the order of 50 or 60 dollars that Random USB generators come out to plug into a PC well they are horrible they have fences they are poorly implemented they have a mo  a lot of problems a lot of problems ok At the end of it all I'll leave you Well then I'm going to publish the list of references too there's a video where they explain where they show it's more the video is very funny because the exhibitor is showing how it breaks  to quantis and he says Unfortunately how much did I sponsor this event but well what am I going to do that's how things are no Well let's go to quantucky Distribution quickly Oh I wanted to introduce the other famous people these are the most famous couple of the  world cryptography who are very good but as in any famous couple this one There is always someone in the middle and a triangle is made and in that triangle whoever generates the Triangle here is not elegant It is OK Those are the characters that are going to intervene now How  normal public key cryptography works what Alice does is sends her public key to Bob what Bob does is sends his public key Alice l  the two combine their own public and private keys and generate a shared secret they both have the same secret and then they start translating To transfer the encrypted and decrypted information with that same secret this is how the public key works the public key scheme But why do they do that  because in the middle it's there ok because if they wouldn't do it ok well how does this work in quantum in quantum it's slightly different what it does is I generate keys in quantum form yes I transmit it over a quantum channel and what I do is that key that  I had to in private public key I had to pass a private and a public part and combine it sir now I don't need to do it anymore because the shape because and you can't get in the middle Because if you get in the middle and read some of the cubes  it collapses and breaks it and breaks the key and both Bob and Alice realize that this key was broken and they generate another one again Ok so that's the way and just ge  He got the key and sent it now let's see quickly I don't have time left how to do it This is something like this let's see if we can enlarge it a bit this works more or less like this this is done with laser what is done is send photons  Alice calls out photons, those photons are vertically or diagonally polarized, that is, vertical, I mean vertically square, horizontally, or diagonally.  plus 45 is a 1 if it is with minus 45 it is a zero This is how Alice sends the photons to the polarizers those are random if it is a totally random sequence then what is transmitted through the quantum channel are qubits that are in certain states  We don't know when Bob is there, he only reads them how he reads them, he reads them with polarizers too, and which polarizers Bob uses too, a random sequence of vertical horizontal plus 45 minus 45  the message was transferred there are ones and zeros on both sides both have a number of ones and a number of zeros on both sides if they left it got in the middle at that moment it is known that there is a one that they were compromised then and go thinking  for the next question, so what they do is they send it again Ok they send it again until they know that the channel is clean ready everything has a quantity of covite on one side and on the other ok now you put a random sequence of polarizers and and Alice  And you too, so what do they do later on through a commercial channel, my polarizers were these And you tell them not even mine were these and they compare them when the polarizers are the same, that is, everything that is different, they discard when they are the same, those means that those ones  and zeros of the same polarizers are the same for voice and the same for Alice Done you already have the public key Sorry the private key both Ok the key the comp secret  game And from there they encrypt ok well I just gave you the clue what can I do to prevent Alice and voice from communicating like I stay in the middle and I start reading and I start reading and I start reading and what  I'm generating a denial of service attack there I can't know the code but it didn't say that they communicate imagine that they are communicating here I don't know the clear ones for the launch of an atomic bomb Yes and the other country grabs and gets in the way and  He says you're never going to send him this guy's password. It's ready Ok well, those who are working a lot, a lot, a lot on this are the Chinese a lot and I'm not going to talk to them about now and measure your professor Anthonyger who had to get the Nobel Prize  a little ago just because of his his contribution instantly cubits because I don't have the time left so I'm going to go ahead they're working hard on this a lot that's there is a box that's a sat  elite are the satellite family that what it does is generate a laser and throw it at two ground stations at the ground stations receive those cubits and there they have the keys why they do it from a satellite because through the vacuum space there is almost no  of coherence So the cuits stay alive the states of the guinea pigs stay alive throughout the journey they only start to change a little when they enter the atmosphere OK That's why you can't do transfer in the atmosphere in fiber optics they have quite a few problems  Seriously, I am going to show you quickly the cockroach problems I have five minutes left, they are very expensive and I have to distribute the public key with satellite, imagine what a public key, not one, is going to give me. Sorry, one, one, one, one, one, public key, because this is  for is the shared secret It is not the public key that I am going to use as many times as I want every time I want to send a message I am going to need one  new password don't look at what is going to come out is terribly slow it is 1 or 2k the speed they have then the One time pad and those things of for example making a message from it a password with the same length as the message are the things that  that is spoken it is very difficult to do it this way many implementation problems have a lot of implementation problems have a lot there are many things that can be done what I said I put myself there in the middle to read cubits even though the guy doesn't do anything with it afterwards  it detected that someone read my message it does not generate the password new general again general again I never have the password and I have another terrible problem which is I am sending two stations on the ground Who are the people at the stations on  land is or there are others I don't know I have no idea I have no way to authenticate the receiver I have to use conventional methods classic methods to authenticate the receiver Ok well fixed  This is the position of the National Security Center of England But there are a lot of countries that have similar things, they say don't use this, don't use it, it's still very new, well, and quantum communication, I'm not going to get there, I have three minutes left, but I'll show you very quickly, This is  Well, there are two techniques that are super dancecoding And teleportation when you say superdens coding, can you imagine something like that? I can't imagine this selling a lot of things inside a little thing like that, well, super decoding is only transmitting two bits with a cubits Okay, it's done well  I'm going to skip it the same way here normally the one that generates the bits is a reliable source called Charly but it could be quietly and there's no problem because he can't see anything and that is, he can't see anything here [  Music] This is the way in which those two cubes are transmitted the other is teleportation if you say teleportation what do you imagine as teleportation  ation I imagine this, in fact, just as I told you about the brain and quantum there are many people who say that this can be done with quantum I can't imagine Mr. Spock at 273 degrees below zero I can't imagine how it looks OK  But well, what is teleportation? It is transmitting the state of a cubit, that is, a quantum state through two classical cubits. I am not going to explain it to you because I don't have time left, but it is like that and a quick myth.  two qubits at two extreme points of the universe that are connected, which is as if it were the same particle on both sides, I change something here and I change here, in reality it is not that it changes exactly the same, but rather it is the complement, but each action that is the same is  I have here I will have here then And it is instantaneous I communicate at the speed of light plus the speed greater than that of light Yes for this it is super Lumia einsteins says here he was wrong well no because because  In these two forms of communication that I showed you before in the two forms in one form I have to tell someone someone has to tell you I converted these two bits into one in the state of the qubit And in the other case you have to send the  cubit so that it processes it together with the cubit that they have and generates the message in both cases I have to send information by classical means at a speed less than the speed of light Ok so superluminal communication does not exist with  this Ok another other another one of my conceptions that there is in these things good summary Aha 55 seconds I have left this is a summary table that this with everything we have seen so far we have in quantum computing we have those algorithms that are the ones that are being used  What each one of them is used for, we have just told you what is the state of maturity of each one of them and what are the problems and vulnerabilities that each one has, the only two points that  I did not mention this, which are the last two, which are quantum memory and repeaters. Quantum memory is something that is conceptually somewhat illogical because I cannot copy it like a cubit, I cannot copy it. How can I do to have memory? Well, the concept is to carry  a cubit and I save it and then I bring it back it's always the same cubit That's the concept of quantum memory it's very crazy there are very few things done about it it has a very short time a few milliseconds it lasts what I can do OK And this is great it's great  Because the Chinese with that of the one of the satellites say Ok I can reach 1600 kilometers but I want to go further how do I do it Ah easy I put repeaters in the middle Ah I put repeaters I grab the message decrypted it and I encrypt it again I have a  lots of possibilities to do more or Miguel in there OK So everything that has quantum repeaters is totally hackable we rounded off I finished they put the r  Let's round up Well, I don't know if you want to ask, I think the questions go outside, right, they don't tell me out there, but okay, that's it, that's it, if you have any questions, I'm outside, greetings to Carlos Benítez, then we're going to receive Eduardo
