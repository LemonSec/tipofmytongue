Well, we welcome Dan Morgano and Liliana Barrio Nuevo With a round of applause [Applause] Good, how are you doing, Thank you, Thank you for coming, Thank you for taking the time, let's see.  what to do with turning our cell phone into a camera device Yes with mes Solutions well We are Iliana barrionuevo and dan burgoña we are application Security engineers orange x we ​​have other activities within what is resarching as well and you can find us on Twitter with that hands  for a little while this is research that we have been doing a lot of us on our private side, it does not have to do specifically with working in orange because we just test applications that also compete with orange X And ​​the solutions that probably x a lot of these things Although we had the opportunity to  applying the day to day in what we do orange does not have  things that come from before is a job that takes many years and thank you nothing but for the opportunity to give us allowing us to expose these things so good Thank you very much to our our emperor so good this passes quickly we are simply going to comment on some cases of abuse  Regarding the devices, for example, this one that we have here, which is the one that everyone knows about, in Pos, different solutions, because we chose this device, good in principle, because the transmission of communication is given by Bluetooth between this device and the cell phone, because on the other hand, there is no code.  from pairing yes from payding to precisely associate this device with the cell phone we wanted to see how secure it was Also because it supports Bluetooth 4.0 which we know has some insecure issues and Because sensitive information is handled with what is nfc the magnetic stripe and by chip and by  the other side that we would also see how much the end user can manipulate how much he can  You can manipulate in the business flow, in addition, we can do so much with a device, a cell phone, both rooted and not rooted, indistinctly. Well, we have different solutions.  make a payment or use this new solution It's good that there are different flyboards they have, they will have the application that I am integrated with.  The reader that works for something Jack that the information that passes through is basically by audio that can pass encrypted well it did not happen and we the last case that is where we precisely do the analysis are Bluetooth readers yes I tested in the same capacity of reading information from  the cards and then you strip them via bluetooth to an application that will be controlled  ador yes these are the flavors that exist there are others probably But well in Argentina nowadays you can find these in the vast majority well we found different solutions there you can see some brands But all of them Reside all use microcontroller technology from behind they use Bluetooth Classic And what's more  I'm going to Energy, well, on the other hand, they just use nfc readers by chip and by magnetic stripe and they integrate with Android, well, sacred examples, we have several, note that some in the note that some have the same shape, that's precisely because it's a sale behind these devices now  I will explain to you if you have manufacturers and then their manufacturers, these devices each time you adapt it to us, generate an sdk and then a tool, a solution. For example, a virtual wallet is adapted by this sdk to make it to integrate the payment platform and the payment circuit, well, the  simple process is so the user approaches the card to  make the payment The seller will receive the payment that he has made in his application, so there we already have a communication of the card with the device, the device in turn processes the application That information that the device handles, the application sends it to the payme  in processor and the first teacher passed it to the bank and the bank of course is going to communicate or the bank whatever it is is going to communicate in turn with other other entities behind us We try to identify failures in these four points that  You see here the communication between the card and the device between the device and the application between the application the same application the data it handles How we can take advantage of perhaps some tricks that we can apply to the application to manipulate the information or simply steal it and in turn  the communication that exists between the application and the server Well, a little more of the same that we have mentioned  previously we have chip readers magnetic stripe readers nfc readers we have firmware and Kiss updates that are handled in the device over the air and what we mentioned is that Bluetooth 4.0 is used and you can also use USB and  Different protocols that are seen here are supported. Well, Dan is going to tell you a little. I don't know if I'm going to tell you a little about the security mechanisms that are already implemented and that they suppose should be respected in these solutions, in broad strokes, what it has.  What to ensure the entire channel is that the customer's information reaches the payment platform completely securely and that person who made the payment can be sure that another payment will not come to him;  cards are going to clarify it in broad strokes very stabilized very simple behind there are many protocols many things but in broad strokes security gives you a protocol  olo that is based on two systems on the one hand the encryption that is triple is and on the other hand I have a management system here that basically a mechanism a protocol to be able to manage the keys that I need to generate at both points to be able to encrypt the  information and decrypt it when it arrives yes and another security mechanism inside All they have are Bluetooth 4.0 padding to be able to secure a little bit of communication in the air when a person makes a payment and well precisely Those are the three largest mechanisms out there that  one can find when one analyze type solutions What the triple cap finger is based on is simply a symmetric encryption key on one side the same key on the other encryption the other It is simply So it is quite secure it is a standard it is used a lot I have to apt is a  protocol that is used precisely when I have the problem of passing a key on both sides and how do I make sure that it is  precisely the key that is traveling is not intercepting me And bothering them using it to decrypt the same message I have to feel like it will be a system that consists of three keys, a Master key which is the Master key which is basically the key where everything should be from that  Master key is generated for each device that is on the street an ipk that is the second the second little square that you see there that is a unique key for each device with that nail and unique for devices here after each time a transaction is made on the device  a new key will be generated by a counter and with that it will encrypt the information when the information is sent and the backend arrives and at the time of charging the system behind says this device I know the Master key I know the device I know  a ksn which is a value that I am going to explain to you and with that the same key that the device generated at that moment generated the key and with that it decrypted the information yes S  What this protocol is supposed to avoid is that if someone steals a key, it does not compromise the rest of the transactions that were generated in the same environment and some concepts simply so that you understand when we show you so much information and any little things, see here is the  More From here, the ip is the key that each device has, it is assumed that this element is embedded in the firmware when it leaves the factory, you can update the vendors, but in mechanisms to update it, update it even over the air via Bluetooth or USB  and it almost comes is an identifier that the device generates when it has to make a transaction and that travels right with the encrypted information to tell it what key the cowboy system has to generate when the information arrives and the other thing we have, for example, are the encrypted keys that  on Twitter tracks that it is the encrypted information that travels precisely in the process and the other that I am going to tell  r a little is the information that we are trying to protect that this is precisely what these security mechanisms have to provide that the Data that you as a client are going to put in a virtual wallet card system arrives and is totally secure  I can use the card with complete security and this is based on the fact that, for example, simply to say it to you, the card has three broad technologies because I do not have the Max strike, what are they and what is static information, how can the electronics guys tell you that this information does not change?  and once it is stolen it can be emulated again and a card clone can be made from this those that provide a kind of intelligence layer to prevent the data from being cloned to ensure that the robe arrives encrypted come out  and on top of that the FC is implemented which is simply an extension in radio frequency of this same technology and is supposed to send secure and nfc if  Just an extension of this ability, but if I show you a little bit, there is a kind of correlation between the information that I can get from the chip and envy and the information the guys said that a downgrade attack can be made from the nfc information.  You can try to get the information that would go that would be correlative to the information that the maxstripe has in the cards. This is going too high because we just have little time, but what you see above is the information in the first three rows, the first two correspond to information that  It is on Track 1, which is in the black part of the cards, and the third row is the same information, but this information is a little narrower than the book and I send it to the moment.  What you see below is information obtained with an application called River Pro or River creper that basically allows us to use phone nfc  phone read a card and get the equivalent of what would be the information that would have to have in the magnetic strike And with that information you can take it to an emulator Like a maxbook or a Cat bomber for example and you can emulate that information and you can do  a charge Yes, this is the information that I am trying to protect Yes, that is essential If someone obtains this from me, they can already charge my name, so after analyzing the protocol How security works, what happens in the air, it comes from us  certain certain certain questions first What happens if you open the device you have before What happens if I start listening to the information buses What happens interacting with the microcontrollers allows me to operate the device Yes to the titan perinson mechanism that prevents you from opening the device  and can operate with the same what happens with the communication in Bluetooth pass the air What happens if someone is sitting mine and ugly l  to bluetooth information You can take my data What happens if in the place where the place I am paying for is so much fought even a rooted phone or It has cold installed What happens can you take the data from me What about the audio Rider continues for the information 3  ,5 What happens if information is stolen from your PC, can you do something with it? What happens if my data is injected into that River and or with some tool at the most?  mercadopago solution and we found precisely that certain characteristics of these protocols are not met, among them is that one of the things that the Kiss marshment euca PT protocol forces you to do is that when I generate a Yes key and encrypt information with that key that key  I cannot reuse it, it is information, it must be used only once and if I make that information a Replay, I should not be able to make any other purchases because  It should be invalidated only once, so what we basically did is we took the Mercado Pago solution. The Mercado Pago solution has certificates and pinning. Those who are on Android know that there is simply a way to ensure that communication passes completely securely between the application.  and only the application will communicate with the official servers of Mercado pago and what we did on the other side of the vs grabbing a phone I rooted it in my case I used magis you can use any other routing system I installed Xbox and on xpose it  install a module like that would be a peeling yes this because I'm just a ford they could have done it with other solutions inside with cold with the Jacksons I could have done it simply by tampering it by making static instrumentation on the application for having done a lot of way  I like this I was going about it use there ready So ​​the first thing I did is try  to clean the information, the first thing a seller does is saving an application certificating and starting the new traffic and I found that the first thing that happens is that a lot of information is of no use in what the pediment is. Yes, there is a lot of information, one of the  Things we try to look for When we make an application is that if you don't need something to be displayed I didn't bring it from the truck and it's a big problem when we analyze the traffic that comes and goes between the truck from MercadoLibre to mercadopago sorry we saw that here is an answer to this  It is simply when you swipe the card, you make a message to Barra care token and the answer that is on the right you will see that the first thing it brings is a pin that is the first eight digits of the ocr the ocr the code of the card yes  of the sixteen later, it brings the expiration date below, notice that what I actually sent you, the only thing I sent you is encrypted information, enter with one and Track 2 is the information  n encrypted with the protocol with triple of with the hand in the car, notice that it has these these tags that I told him about the coffee at the Point but I see that information now is when Mercadopago answers me I have the information of the card that I am doing  note that I have information that I need to make a payment, I am going to show it now but I have the last four digits. So, out of 16 I already have 12, only four are missing, the expiration code, I have the first ones. Well, if that digit and then I  What does he do next is precisely when a reader concert payment that is the oldest reader asks me to enter the pin the cbv of the card and that yes and also asks for the person's ID so my ID travels with that I can't get my  name and the psychotic that what is down there so I already obtained simply by cleaning the traffic for information that did not show me all the information I need to reconstruct the data  s of the person who is paying at that moment Then you will know that surely you have bought through a lot of web platforms that need the ocr that are the first I did digits the expiration date The cbv that I already have and the name of the card  which is a really public name So what am I missing? I'm missing four ocr digits that I don't have because the first 8 and the last four saw me. Well then I have to try 999 ocr codes to find the one with the value no no  This is how the card code has a defined structure, yes, it is not that I can have any number, they maintain a mathematical structure that can be validated by the python that is there, it is a very dumb script, they will find it later, they will find it everywhere, it is simply  To validate with a card, the only thing I did is try to reconstruct the codes of the r that I am missing, simply luping and discarding numbers, but from 1999 I will stay  n only a thousand So I simply have to try among a thousand card codes and I go with the data that I have to make the purchase valid and with that I can go to charge purchases to the name of the person yes simply Starting the traffic and with approximately  30 hours 30 hours without manual automation towards a monkey testing pa pa pa in approximately 33 hours I can guess the code the code of a card that is nothing yes considering that I can charge that card 200,000 300,000 pesos if that is what it allows me  the application And how can I do this obligation well can you generate the rebukes can I do I can try on different platforms I can and what is the big problem with this system it is very difficult to block usually the collection systems block from behind exclusively when I found that  Someone is trying to guess, you can see the seal, I have it, it is very difficult to block a, it is not r, there is no from Modesto, because really  It doesn't make sense, it's trying to make purchases But relative, you can already guess, but come on, you can actually come, obviously, for a short time with three, four people, you can guess the ocr of a person who is there, apart from this, we said well, just one of the things  that it provides us I have to learn is that it cannot be replicated The information then the first thing we did is try to make a data reuse attack I have very simple to charge the information travel from the device to the phone from the phone the information goes encrypted  del vaquen answers me what I do when information comes out of the phone to the vaquen captures the information and then I go to another store another business and what I do is When making a payment step on the information make this power of the same information that it sends  and see if I am actually paid and now what we are going to show is good, precisely this information that I try to reproduce  Note that this information could be encrypted only once and should be discarded The idea is just to show you now, good, full lab, we're going to sign the demo, just in case something is missing from the live demo or if I can fix it right now, I have a lab, basically it's a  rally Proxy running on my local computer listening to the traffic and I'm going to show you Here is basically the web rally that is simply a tool to be able to interact with the information a little more in an easier way since I have my Galician account in this case  I'm going to enter the Galicia account again because I have my account at the Galicia session where if you let me in, there it is, I have the last movement, notice that the last movement was 12 pesos, it was a test that we did. This account is associated with this debit card.  Yes, what we are going to use as a target, what we are going to do is that we have two rooted phones connected by  Proxy and with sslpining from the Xbox sl module a 2.0 pin at this moment a Mercado pago account that is the one I have is my account that at this moment this phone is in airplane mode it is without WiFi and this account is with the  WiFi in proximal mode what we are going to do is that we are going to go first to collect with Point the phone of the Iliana account connects to this payment market yes it is number 2 in Point in this case we are going to make the vital purchase cobra and  that it will be 55 pesos yes so that you can see it in the transactions and what we are going to do is that we write we are going to make the purchase notice that everything I am doing is logging in the tracks here once I know  associated to the device, what it asks me is to pass the card so the first thing I'm going to do is that I'm going to bring it closer by nfc make a charge the card is read here what I had at this moment I had it I had it intercepting data I'll do it  to get the technique  to the data section simply so that you can see it fluently and here it asks me directly to enter the ID of the person who is charging as in this case I am MercadoLibre it does not let you charge you my friend but I am going to charge right now that is  This is the Italian account, as well as that he was charging me, it's a peace. It's as if I just went to a store and paid with my card for a good and I left. In my case, I already made the payment. This phone can stay in airplane mode, yes.  I'm going to download it, the Wi-Fi has no data, yes, and both the system mode and the card, as well as the dialer, I can turn them off because I'm not going to use it anymore. The truth is that I already needed the intercept, if you look closely, I'm going to have it in the  first part the part that is called the ones that a post to cartokens says Yes this information that interests me this is the information that should not be able to be replicated or used again so what I am going to do is that I am going to  cop  iar and I'm going to take it here and I'm going to paste it simply to have it Yes this information has to do with the data the Track that is encrypted ksnxpoy that are data that we are going to explain in the talk about what will they be for if  We haven't explained it up to now, so what I'm going to start to do is that I'm going now. From this moment I'm going to go to the attacking phone, I'm going to connect it to the network.  any card in this case a next card this card no longer works anymore it is inspired to trigger the rich man and step on him with the information that I just stole yes I start what is the intersection of the tokens yes the Card tokens that the information  that they should be interested in intercepting and being able to change the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to start a charge already. In advance I already have this Data copied, yes And here and I go back to the phone and I'm going to make a charge with mercadopago what I have in it is  It's time I turn on the second device and I'm going to charge with Point I already have it associated with this device to my personal account of Mercado de Naranja de MercadoLibre and I'm going to tell them that I want to charge a monster quite high in this case 500 pesos  I am going to charge and they are already broadcasting Proxy is already intercepting information so what you are asking me to bring the nfc or the payment system closer to the post what happens immediately is that the information was intercepted and what I am going to do is now I go here  to edit the information control control go OK And I press him twice because interesting both the rich day and he came and now he asks me to put the ID in this case right now I am going to use any ID 58 yes And again here he asks me  summarize the information because it also hits cardboard and note that it is processing the charge And at this moment if everything goes well the transaction should go through Yes then I was charged with the information stolen from another place and  therefore, what I am going to see now is that it is indeed in my account in Galicia, I was debited both times, what I will go to next is that I go to my account and you can see that the last movements this was Iliana's account that were  at 55 pesos and this is my account and my MercadoLibre business that has a very particular name where it charges me 500 pesos yes and again I don't have this physical card anymore you can make a charge without having the physical information with that I'll summarize we'll give you  [Applause] wait, wait until it's missing It's still a long way to go This was fixed on the Mercadopago side It's not a vulnerability exclusively theirs It's because of a system because it's behind in payment transactions So thank you and work with Mercadopago for just taking  the bar follow us look for a solution the truth is that they have behaved 10 But what is the problem mercadopago just ready well managed to block the transaction but it is still silent  Although the protocol is well implemented and effectively blocks transactions when they are encrypted twice with the same Key, the problem that exists is that since I have control of the phone, I can make the person who is paying believe  I can do it, it can deceive people into passing the card twice and in broad strokes What this attack would give is that a person from Vinilian comes to pay me, pass the device, pass him your card, he says that I charge a mistake, but I get that information  I captured it, I didn't send it, then he passed it again precisely because it tells him to try it and baby pass again and I sent the first information there and I'll capture the second information that I captured, I keep it for myself to later make a transaction And with that information  I could make you a copper Liliana Yes Even though the transaction can be done only once, the encryption and the encryption process I can capture it, I have the  Total control of the phone and this is one of the big problems. Your solutions leave control of the payment platform to the user than to say to the seller that The seller may be a malicious agent and you are not protecting the data of  the clients, that is, even though the pptv protocol simply comes, you can continue attacking while I have control of the Android phone, that is, it is very difficult to mitigate this type of problem, well, obviously, we have to talk about what happens in orange, well, also analyzing the flow of  touch yes the charges with this device we find some things some cases of abuse that we raised like the one that they mentioned where the seller what he is going to do is start the payment process the collection process actually positioning ourselves as sellers from the application  then choose to charge with touch associate the device by Bluetooth and Configure the data well in this case the amount  or to charge, then what the user does is just approximate the card to this device and that charge is made, then we observe that there are two communications One between the device, actually the application with orange, and another communication that is towards geopayments, then we saw that there are certain  validations that perhaps we could go and walk well four simple steps to graph a little orange create the transaction with a first line the second root is going to go to geopayments also starting that collection process then it is confirmed and then the status is consulted well  so here I am going to put the video I am going to tell you a little about it here pretend that I have already learned the device I am Starting the collection process I am already intercepting the traffic the client is doing this Yes so Well there begins the  process all the communication a first line is that it does not matter, simply consult the plans etc.  there the amount is 10 pesos all of this OK Well how much is going to be received and now you are getting rich is that you are just going to start the process.  here they take time Well, the process begins there, so there will be another rich one, this is the one we said, the first one that creates the transaction, it has an identifier like any transaction that ends in C, that is what I am going to clarify so that we can follow the thread, then it will  What is going to happen is that a token is received that initiates the communication with geopayments, which is the second communication that I mentioned to you, that touch lasts 15 minutes, but note that in the rich it is we find this data similar to the one that is shown Encrypted data and  what is tlv, which is like the format that is used precisely in payments where we also have included the encrypted data that we see here if there is also the amount among other information and it is followed  maintaining the air of a transaction if that is what I was telling you more or less and there is the ksn that can also be seen there we are going to see it in detail then It is confirmed in this third step The transaction is confirmed everything goes OK it is processed but  The Happy Little Walk left So I just kept the first one rich is that I had the encrypted Data I go to King Peter which is the Word tool where all I do is create a parallel transaction with the same data that was encrypted  keeping the ksn keeping tlv everything that was there and the only thing I do is simply change one character of the transaction so that on the other side it is believed to be a new one but keeping this data that I am checking that this is the problem that  we are mentioning then well. Apparently it enables me to continue with the process so what I am going to do is continue confirming these transactions towards geopayments in this case everything  I did the process and well I'm going to confirm it so I change it again as to keep it I changed it to the letter d But it can be any other value and it is processed Yes then there we see that if I wanted to check the status of the transaction it tells me that a  They paid me 10 pesos yes refusing data So something that shouldn't have happened right now in more detail what we had seen there you can see the 10 pesos that are among the data TV Yes I tried to do some things observe there I decoded it notice that  the site that and in vilab decodes that information is the ksn you can see the encrypted data of the card the transaction there are other data that I don't know which are that are encrypted so well there we saw that everything was processed Ok and notice that you can see the original that  it is the one below and the second one is the trout The false one that is the one that I reduce the data well what else can be done Well we could use Frida or Jackson in this case I used my c  elular that it is not rooted, that is, to give you an idea that we do not necessarily have to have a rooted cell phone, what we could do is coquet the different methods and send us that information, programming certain snipets, we execute them with Frida with obsession And that information we finished  to collect it by intercepting the traffic simply with these tools we could send it to our server And steal it then Well, it doesn't matter there everything looks very small but simply mention that I started to listen What methods appeared as I interacted with the application there  I am using objection and indeed I see that by listening to the methods of one of the classes I also receive the information in memory, the objects in memory of what we were just waiting for, the encrypted Data and the tlv data, the ksn, etc. So what could I do? Well  there it is true later for your investigation fix  I showed that it was indicated that a certain method was called, the encrypted value was also returned, the ksn, among other things, so, well, that is one of the examples of things that we could do later, program things and take the data that we captured without rooting the phone simply with  objection you can get the same data from the transactions within the application that is, get the data from practically the phone I didn't need a rooted phone or anything special or certified and Pin and nothing is quite simple yes and I'm going to go a little further  quickly so that because we are going to run out of time but simply tell you that in this case I wanted to have the amount of the transaction manipulated, which was what they give, it was also done in the payment market and the question is that I could not even manipulate the attributes of the model  Rico is not even manipulating the TV data that was there, for example, a purchase that was 11 pesos here was modified to 15 and I couldn't, in fact, there I went out  ta the error that the information does not match what was reported by the chip I wanted to make it massive What happens if I start sending all rich things like crazy with the data creating obviously modifying what makes the transaction ID change what happens well Apparently  It seemed that everything was going well but they rejected my payments, they denied me my cards and Well, there are security controls in this flow. At least they prevent someone from carrying out a massive attack.  They had showered me well the denied denied and notice that what happens is that well since I had used my own account to make those payments to myself try that it was due but again it was done accreditation was made that is, the payments were reversed so  well in that sense we have some protection the other one that is going to show just another of the attack platforms we saw this where  e Wilde doing fraud analysis in what is orange x we ​​find that in broad strokes what it does from behind as I told you these little gadgets are manufactured by someone for sale that is adopted by a company from abroad that generates an sdk and then companies  third, in this case, orange x integrates its virtual wallet system and simply what a payment cat does, the information that enters touches the base, a geopayment backen returns If the transaction has been tested, no, and then the backen of Che knives tells me  you have money What we are beginning to see is precisely that there is a kind of trust channel when the information reaches the cow and it is decrypted, it is supposed that at no time has it been so fought over because it has a fairly robust encryption system like triples what we started  let's see that in broad strokes we saw that they go down there were many rejected transactions many rejected purchases that always made mistakes and were rejected for the same reason  or purchases of one minute on average and I always get rejected by myself with that remember at the beginning that I showed you the information that has this magnetic inside it has a cbv that you can see it is the security code it is not the same as it is on the card  the card has two security codes, the one that was printed on the back and that was inside the magnetic stripe Yes, that code always failed and there were a lot of three actions for the same ocr for the same card José berrón that erroneous berrones but one of all those transactions  It was proven and then a purchase was going to be made for a fairly large amount of 90,000 or 100,000 pesos and a person came to that person and the statement found me 90 thousand pesos where it came from so we began to analyze and one of the hypotheses that we  I was injecting at some point I was injecting the data which did not happen because the information comes out encrypted from the device and is decrypted exclusively  and the alternative was that there is a state trying to inject data into the device and this is exactly the case again like the ones that the electronics guys showed that I already did a lot of publicity for it this can be done with the macbook the macbook basically allows you or  You brought a coil closer to it, you brought a reader of this strike closer to it and you can emulate two tracks from practically any card. I think you can fly up to three a little more here in Argentina.  It has a Brute Force attack, eh, usually one loads a code or you can load it in the most basic version, you change it with the card and you dance like a mule. So what we want to do is emulate, replicate this attack to see if the attack was actually  that someone was trying to emulate cards to the device that is, I was trying to use an input channel to be able to guess the cb and  do it relatively automatically this is just a diagram there you have an arduino I'm going to show you a little bit This is a prototype prototype what comes here is very crude if anyone who is a little bit electronic I'm going to want to shoot myself but basically here  which is a breadboard I have an arduino promicro there I am going to show you a little bit the demo has a motor driver it has a button and it has a little coil that is connected to what is like new it does not have the protection system we had disarmed a touch and we had  I took out the electromagnetic head a little bit simply so that it could be read better and there wouldn't have been any damage in the middle. We implemented what you can see at the back, again there's this patched part, if you want, I'll pass it on to you later. The code is basically the implementation of  of macbook on arduino yes that again it does Exactly the same thing and what we add on top of that is that it allows you to use  generate the parts of Track one and Track 2 and the means to be able to generate dynamically each time an error occurs generates a different CD so what we are going to show now is precisely the attack process that we arrived at, so in the tacante basically the  The person entered wanted to make a charge, he connected to what the reader is and when the person charged, he brought that device closer and reproduced a new CV code as there is a layer of trust. Yes, it is very difficult to realize that this is indeed carrying out an attack  of Brute Force and block the cards Yes, because again There is a trusted channel and that is what the attackers were abusing and in particular we found reproducing this attack That there were two responses to the card eventually when one does more than 10 tests it is blocked but  The answer that came from the payment market is different. Even though the card is blocked, I would answer you in one way or another if everything looks correct.  or then the attacker almost blocks the card tested tested when he saw that the answer was different because he had hit him The cbv waited for his card to be unlocked later there he goes to make the purchase the process worked what I'm just going to show Moy now  in a very crude way, it is simply the process that we did to emulate this, obviously it cannot be reproduced because this is already fixed like the rest of the vulnerabilities, but what we wanted to show is how the gadget works, simply for forced, let's say no no no it doesn't have much particularity  but so that you can see how it worked and what we had to resort to precisely because we didn't have the device anymore and the things we were learning in the process using the macbook implementation on arduino to do a brute force attack in order to validate  credit card using simply the touch that we have in orange and this is the solution  which we arrived at based on the tests that I am moving at the Fraud Analysis level what I have here is simply a touch and what you see here is simply the touch totally disarmed and a Power Bank is connected yes simply with a matter of ease  of use and what it has here disassembled in particular Is that I have removed what is the reader, the head to read the magnetic stripe and it was simply wrapped through a coil which is in charge of making the reader believe that a  card and here is simply the implementation of macbook on arduino promicro which is a garden implementation or Leonardo a motor driver It is simply the same as a macbook has and a button to simply emulate any card But the interesting thing that I have here that behind  I have the serious Arduino Monitor and every time I touch the button what we are going to see is that I am going to emulate a different card. This is just good  Just so you don't see the card, but you can see those last digits here. Only that it would have to emulate when it is in charge of passing a different cdb in each transaction. So every time I touch the button it will emulate a different CD, simply what  I want to show you how easy it is to be able to emulate a brute force attack through arduino And using the maxford code, what we are going to do is simply make a purchase, they will see that this is already patched, it is done, they will not see  nothing, nothing exploitable, but the idea is to teach the three how the attack worked, an attack begins, a collection of orange, and for each time a card is wanted to be passed, a code is passed again, and in this way, from the answers, it was guessed if  the CBR correctly which makes orange connects When I touch that one there And now it asks me to insert the card so I'm just going to touch the button I wait for the card button  and it is simply patched up to the moment when it fails you simply see the white response it is blocked whatever the White response is but notice that I can try again later another one is seen and reads it again and notice that this time every  time I'm flying a new card in a relatively simple way Well we are very short Time so let's summarize the rest we also seek to attack the bluetooth platform in this case we attacked at the time a solution that worked no longer works that was market that was  everything paid the first thing we did open the device we saw that it had a special chip and that chip supports virtue protocols I had it 3.0 and the bus 5.0 5.0 is quite vulnerable it is a Grace over 4.0 it can be cleaned So the first thing we did is try  I'm going to go too far on this, I'm not going to go into detail, we discovered the characteristics, we discovered the options that it basically has.  within a feature it has a service of a service it has features that allow you to write and read data which is where the data that goes to and from the card goes through and Well I wanted to make a transaction we installed the sdk that is officially provided by the vendor for example and  what we did a transaction, note that the first thing I try to do in this case is an example application to a collection and it shows me all the data that I am going to send the cow and what I do simply with video since there are three microbits connected to the  inflating the three channels again I'm not going to go into much detail When we have time and I went to warhack to see that you were cleaning this information that I am cleaning in the bluetooth on the air and note that there is a direct correlation between information that passes encrypted and  the information that I am cleaning in the air means that by Bluetooth 5.0 me sitting next to a business If a person was charging  I could interpret this information I could hack the application of the interaction and you could take that information to me to make an email in the future yes But what is the problem all payment does not use 5.0 it uses 3.0 which is a little more secure Yes because again  4.0 and 5.0 are downgraded to give you more capacity less capacity the data charge but to make the Bluetooth device last longer battery life a few more things then We find that 3.0 can't easily inflate you need a relatively expensive device  I don't have it and I'm not going to buy it either so I went to see the h6 every Android phone what you can do is basically tell it that it's my faith and I listened to all the information that is going to come out via Bluetooth so I'm going to do just that I took out the H  Followed Download from my Android when they say the transaction and also comes the same as the information that is going to pass encrypted space in that fact that Glock  In other words, when the information is released from Android, it passes without encryption, without encryption, a custom, what is the problem, that the Bluetooth 3.0 protocol, when two elements would be paid, make an encryption layer? Yes, even if this information leaves the phone without encryption, when  It comes out to which the bluetooth stack comes out, encrypted But what is the problem? There are attacks because the pairing that the two devices have is basically based on numerics, for this, which is that no devices show you a number of a number and if the two numbers are  equal in positive like this Ok and they would be paid What is the big problem that all your users have they do not have on the screen the person who is operating a device gives Ok to a number that has no way to compare So the attacks are quite possible and just what  that we are doing that we got ahead an attack by Miguel on all payment we could actually execute it but when we publish  When we received a payment, we realized that the solution was already explained, therefore we cannot continue to effectively show a Point-to-Point attack and up to here we basically got to all the payment, he said enough, I don't know if more payments fell, the application fell and we can continue  with the attack But the idea is to continue in the future until we arrive more or less with this investigation I was reading to continue precisely with these attacks in the face of the solutions that are available today because the country is very weak Yes and if it can be done until it measures  a person sitting in the same Business where a person is going to pay can capture information that is in the air then they could make a charge with that information what is left in the future to be able to continue investigating and that we are investigating and that the idea is to bring you things  more interesting future can be done Well the proof of concept sign in the air That is, you can try to update the firmware by Bluetooth this  It has a certain attack surface in particular, what we tested with the Mercado readers, which is very good, is that the signature information is already encrypted, which is great, with the key that is invaded inside, you can also update the ipec, which again is  another attack that has another surface can be done Hardware hacking that we haven't even tried it's about taking out the keys that are inside trying to inject something different it can be done adjusting the firmware we've obtained the firmware of what this all paid for Can be done  injection you can inject nfc data you can insert macbook data you can do a lot of attacks Here we go with this a solution that simply by adding Bluetooth ends up with a lot of attack surface and is breakable on all sides notice we broke the  injection of data in the communication that it is like Bluetooth is broken everywhere so they are solutions that although p  they seem secure they are one shakes them down a bit in many places with this I close mine he said it's worth it and not usually the information that goes through encryption goes through device identifier yes it's device identifier I change it encryption doesn't work  because you can't generate the cow, the code that goes with that is, I buy a reader, it generated a mercadopago account that I have to associate with my face, if I start this fraud, the guys will actually see that the Data came out first from my reading OR  it is not not so exploitable but precisely today well nowadays attacks can no longer be replicated but it is not it is not it is not easy to carry out a scam scale system in broad strokes at a massive level Well now closing we are left  Some final recommendations How can we mitigate or alleviate this a bit This is good using integrated solutions like the one you see on the screen Yes, where encryption is used in twen with mechanics  smos antitampering at the Hardware level and of course reading the manual good to always use single-use keys even try not to reuse the encrypted Data because otherwise what is the use of using a key per transaction and all this history good just to monitor the association between  accounts mobile devices etc. and good general generic validations do not trust the intermediate steps if I already validate in the middle good at the end No, that is precisely what you should not do always validate everything at the end good enable notifications via email preferably good  revalidate good etc. Thank you very much thank you for staying this end Thank you for waiting for us I know you are tired that you want to steal a beer that we listened to you for a couple of questions and they leave us I think not to throw her out later except pookies everyone can ask only one question if  you can move the middle microphone closer you can make a line there is nothing  A problem, as everything is working fine. Do you think you are asking a question about the bluetooth snifer with Keller Master? Basically, with which module does the bluetooth snifer depend? The one I do is Bluetooth 4.0, there are three microbits connected with Bills, which is an open thickness, and the other Mariel attack.  simply with two devices 22 two generic USB connectors what I do on the one hand is emulate the device Knowing the scp protocol that it has to have for serial I didn't count that out there because we went above it's serious USB of course it's the same as  a device and on the other side I try to connect immediately to the new device and basically that by Data code I'm going to explain it Yes yes yes I have time What cell phone model did you use to install the Xposed and the Magic expose not all let's say the Nexus X5  it's very old I think I bought it or nothing I mean you're alone and for me it's a beautiful tool a lot of people do pentastin eh inclusimiliano  with virtualized devices and having some hardware I think it opens up a lot of possibilities it's great just for everything that is audio man so excellent excellent [Applause] Well thanks for the time Thanks for being thanks for coming I hope you enjoyed we're not done  the talks on the second day of the ecopart see you again tomorrow on the last day of this
