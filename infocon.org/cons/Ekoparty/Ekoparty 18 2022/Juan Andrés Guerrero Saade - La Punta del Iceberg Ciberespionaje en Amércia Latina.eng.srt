it's all yours [Music] can you listen to me yes perfect Ok Good morning good afternoon My name is Juan Andrés Guerrero Sade normally I can't say my name as we always speak in English the gringos only have jacks left because they can't handle him with the four names but  This has to be the first talk I give in Spanish easily six seven years old So I ask you to please forgive the spanglish for the lack of words if anything I wrote as a high school kid in the Lights seriously Not even then it gives me the  Spanish, but we're going to try. I wanted to, if the purpose of the talk was precisely to speak to this audience, it should be in Spanish. I don't know if the timer wants to start it, but they vote for me whenever they want. Ok, coming to the Eco is something very interesting for me.  heart eco Party 10 years ago It was my first punto security conference and I haven't been back in 10 years So I'm honored to be here with you and to be able to give this talk  and I wanted to prepare something specifically focused on Latin America Because nothing focuses on Latin America in our industry Latin America is a continent, that is, South America is a forgotten continent for a variety of reasons, and I wanted to talk about it, always far from the language, that is, to say things as they are  because things are like that and what can we do then, that is exactly why we are going to deal with this topic of cyber espionage in three parts and I say it like this so that you have patience with me Because first we are going to talk about the topic of cyber espionage intelligence threats International whatever you want like  market as something that is produced as something that is sold from there we are going to talk about the region that is happening here we are going to self-evaluate ideally with local eyes and from there we can talk about steps to take So what we can do from now on to  change things ideally improve our situation But hey just the subject of the cib  espionage for me is something super interesting I don't like it, that is, normally when you are in the subject of malware analysis or threat intelligence, or you specialize in criminal matters, or you specialize in apts and cyber-espionage most of the time, that is, there is no  head in which they equip both things and I tell you the truth For me the criminal issue is not very interesting, that is, what is the money motivation, that is, what is the motivation, has money, that is, all the operations end in the same thing and I have never been  motivated for me i have always loved the subject of mr espionage in large part because it entails a local understanding you have to have context you have to understand the motivations why Someone has spent sometimes millions of dollars trying to build capabilities to explore Sorry to  spy and be able to collect certain types of information that for them is surely strategically valuable how much do they actually exist I put it that way for  that it has existed for 10 years here outside of the issue of intelligence agencies, the global intelligence community where it has been practiced for 2,025 years, but as a matter of the private sector, it did not exist before, in reality, probably from net stocks and in a certain way here I still do not know.  treat it as if it existed I think we have talked about four apts the famous apt not to the subject of Latin America but in reality there is an impressive amount of cyber espionage in what we have discerned published at least from last year because we didn't even have an easy update of the account about 120  actors including certain mercenaries and not counting those who sell capabilities such as hacking gamma etc. that Maddie Maddie's team has been in tag at Google for two or three months and said that they have 36 groups of these that are selling to which they are following up  so there is quite a lot of cyber espionage but it is not that there is a shortage of this but that  We know of hundreds of groups that we tell you to bring in. They are not necessarily related to governments, sometimes they are mercenaries, sometimes they are private capacities, sometimes they may be several apts that are somehow related to an intelligence agency, a military group or the police, but  The important thing here is to emphasize that it is what we know because precisely the activity itself is not in doubt. We know that there is a lot of it and we see espionage. We know that it is an important part of international relations, but our knowledge is in doubt and we do not really realize how much this activity happens.  unnoticed unless someone is paying attention and that's where we actually have this problem in South America that we're going to keep dealing with there's already a difference between what we see and what exists And this is a big problem for academics for people who  It is not in the industry because they say well we do not see so many reports about Apps and cyberespionage  e in Latin America maybe it doesn't exist anymore at this time this year It's ridiculous to say that but we don't necessarily have the material with which to work we are talking about Latin America and this idea that nothing really happens here led them to an image of anxiety  From my childhood this was the school I went to in Guayaquil where I learned my medium Turuleco Spanish as we would say for me it is something very interesting to point out this school because I did not think about it it did not occur to me to think of putting myself there easily in about 20 years but just when  I worked at Caspersky and we were starting to discuss an extremely important apt someone told me you know the German School in Guayaquil will it be that you can talk to someone Yes why good it turns out that there was an apt involved as a Proxy in the same school I went to  since this pestel liked to have local proxies in universities and colleges to be able to filter the information without the victims knowing  n note that there is a lot that is traveling outside the country and it was my first Introduction to the famous equation Group which is a tremendous project something extremely interesting when we want to talk about the tip of the rocket So it is the best of the best of the best let's start  out there but it is something that was not even discussed, the subject was not touched on, there are victims in Latin America, it does not matter, the truth is that cyber-espionage exists here, it happens every day and it happens everywhere, only if we start talking about the subject of attacking groups  Chinese in the region would be drowning in work, something interesting for me, with all due respect to President López Obrador, who commented that something Chris Creeps had said, who was the former director of sisa in the United States, is leaving, and who says that there is no reason to get into our heads this  the idea that the Russians and the Chinese are attacking it is ridiculous to say that they are attacking us in the United States all day and here it is worse, that is, with what is happening  sando It is good financially with China in South America we can talk a lot about the subject but obviously they are looking for this information and it is important to emphasize that we are not the only region I think that the best word is not just a racism against Hispanics but actually  The financial dynamic implies that the talent that exists in In other words, there is so little talent in this industry dedicated to the issue of threat intelligence that they are focused primarily on the United States and as secondary things in Europe, more than anything else on the western continent, hence perhaps the eastern one.  Well, well, Russian and Chinese things appear that we don't see elsewhere, maybe something interesting from time to time you have a store over there in the Middle East and now they serve it more for financial reasons and the economy is not also in the United States maybe  people are not going to want to spend 100,200 thousand dollars on intelligence, threats, reports, iOS rules, etc. But in the med  io oriente and it does like this, so we started to change the focus and try to get that type of business. Although we do not necessarily understand the priorities of these regions better, that is, something to talk about, there is not much follow-up on the groups that are presumed to be European or  Americans Five is etcetera because we have this idea focused on the United States that this is something friendly and we don't have to touch it and well We agree that is, I don't have any problem with these activities in general but I am going to sell intelligence  to the Middle East of Asia Africa South America changes the focus that should change the focus What kind of threats are dealt with in these circumstances and the truth is that it does not happen and it does not happen for a variety of reasons that we are also going to talk about the real question is what  it is relevant to us So we need to know well we could talk about local attackers we could talk about regional attackers economic espionage  mico is actually going to be, I think, the most important thing. If we were to get into this issue, but there is also a lot of activity around the destabilization of social institutions, when these groups are allowed to act with impunity, it opens up that they are not only government groups  it is done here we have 10 hackers or 5 hackers who have the capacity of interest because they cannot be mercenaries because they cannot attack the opposition because they cannot start creating blogs for disinformation campaigns to change this type of conversation if they are not going to  jail without anyone is going to take them into account and this happens but we don't talk about it in the way we should What is the issue of threat intelligence In other words, a bad translation of the Florentinental Legends issue as a market this happened first between the agencies of  intelligence From there it went to the private sector as a way to actually generate recognition marketing Good job m  My company has so many experts, so much knowledge that we find things that other people can't find and over time, when political pressure began to build in these governments, it went to a type of closed market, a subscription model. So maybe it seems like a  crazy but in the United States a company a Force in Five Hundrell that has a tremendous shock that already has all the accoutrements and for having they are interested in knowing what else there is beyond which they perhaps do not know to the point of being willing to  pay 100,200 thousand dollars a year for reports tell me that it is not crazy in terms of finances that we deal with here the companies trying to defend themselves you can create an entire team a shock instead of buying a subscription but precisely if we are going to talk about the product in  yes we are talking well i did not find words for these facts situational awareness does not sound right to me but hey the idea what is sa  see what the attackers are doing at any time not just write a blog but be able to say Ok this infrastructure became this new infrastructure they are signing up here they are attacking such a thing using that kind of tools this kind of malware this kind of web reader  infection and know exactly how to defend if you have the concern that this particular Russian group always attacks us Ok calm down we are monitoring this group and we know that now everyone registers them in volture and uses this type of email and uses such a thing and  You can defend yourself in a more focused way because as you defend yourself from everything it is impossible this entails precisely this active monitoring the famous hunting of threats now with this horrible word fronting that they try to pass on Twitter we still don't know if he is going to stay with us or not  but in reality we are talking about the result of a process and I think we can invent  Here among friends an informal equation of what it takes to create this type of intelligence we can say that to create this we obviously need analysts attention motivation and telemetry and all this sounds super basic but the idea Here What is it let's start evaluating How are we our respective countries  our organizations when we talk about these requirements to create this type of intelligence then let's talk about analysts sounds easy this may be the most problematic part for most countries most companies that is we need to have people with certain special skills we need to give them  resources allow them an institutional institutional approach that is, I can say Well you are a tremendous analyst you are interested in the topic of threat intelligence but I need you to focus on fixing the firewall well you don't have the time you don't have the support the resources and actually I'm talking about one a  collective  Analysts, because there are so few people focused on this that we can, that is, the entire industry of studying intelligence easily enters this room and there would be plenty of space, keep that in mind because when we talk about the fact that we are not serving the other continents well, it is partly not a good thing.  we have an army and they are focused on where the money is the natural motivation the issue of attention actually you have to think about the attention of the analysts as it has a certain bandwidth we can see it super clear with the issue of the invasion of Russia to  Ukraine a lot of people from the industry including me my team we focused 100% on the issue of Ukraine wipers Ukraine new attackers what the Russians are doing we ended up with 7 wipers for Windows 3 for Linux 1 good for satellite modems Green mips focused six months on  this subject if we have these limited resources on the subject analysts specialized in the subject who was looking at China C  North Korea Iran etc. while 80% of the industry was focused on Ukraine So if there is a certain amount of bandwidth that is important and also that implies that you have to have a natural motivation for these people to want to spend time focused on this topic What do they want  say that well the obvious motivation is the obvious money because I say it because Well I looked at time you will end up doing this work as part of a company companies want to earn money if we are going to put expensive specialized resources towards this type of activity normally the  motivation what would it be is money but also the issue of marketing or advertising creating a brandt making it appear that we are bigger than we think is also something that carries value and also the issue of the relationship with governments the governments themselves do not have enough resources  to do this type of analysis themselves, they often depend on companies that are going to dedicate themselves to  this here is a great way to make friends between companies and governments and in the end the most important thing even if you have all these resources together is telemetry which means we need relevant data we need granular and consistent telemetry think about everything an ideared votes  whatever antivirus product you have that tells you this is what is happening in these systems save enough time I will emphasize this with a couple of examples I mean I guess I don't know if many of you have seen the report we put out a month ago about  an apt called metadador I hope there are people here who are interested since we suspect that maybe there are a couple of Argentines out there involved in the group we don't know the platform is called Mafalda just in case but just in case a lot of people from the industry were interested  this issue because they were attacking telecommunications infrastructure in certain countries and what was very interesting to me is before I could  publish the report we approach several companies many partners in the industry say look This is what we have found please search your collections in your sensors to see what you find to see we are talking directly with very talented people interest motivation resources etc. they did not have  nothing relevant telemetry So they didn't see anything And that's what can happen to us here in a certain way Ok Everyone here we met decided that we are going to focus on the threats attacking South America Ok does anyone have data no How much is it selling  devise exdiar antivirus here I don't know which It may not be a good sign since I work for an extir and at the same time you can start to see the semi-open collections as viruses Total there are not as many aplons and submations as there should be and I say I say they should be Because  not being in a position where we're producing this ourselves or collecting this ourselves I don't know what  it helps us to decide to deprive the industry of local information keep it in mind I mean there are privacy issues there is everything you want but as a research topic it is a problem So what does all this really mean Especially with the issue of motivation no one comes to us  to protect until the markets and the stars align and everything is difficult to think that the limited resources that we have that will be 20 companies in the industry are going to decide to focus here unless tomorrow we decide that we are going to spend an impressive amount of money that is not  We have and we shouldn't on the subject of intelligence threats because that's the other thing to be honest with us if you told me I have 100 thousand dollars for my security team spend it on equipment on people analysts everything before buying any subscription I mean it's ridiculous  but I also believe that the other side of the coin is that what we have we have to do ourselves and that is where  The famous call to action is coming and things that we should try to do as a group. Let's talk about concrete steps. I can't. I'm not in a position to assess what's going for Argentina, what's going for Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, etc., but I think we can focus on  certain certain areas certain topics that I think could encourage having more resources to be among them it is super important to create incentives and protection when I talk about protection we had talked about incentives obviously money marketing etc. Also things with journalists for example being able to carry a story do a  follow up and say Ok This is an important story in Argentina Uruguay Whatever and having the interest of investigative journalists etc. carries an incentive In itself That is, if there is a receptive audience to which I can take what I am working on at the same time protection is  important there are many countries good There are certain countries that reacted differently  It was too strong when reports about their operations began to come out What happened the analysts said Wow well I don't mess with such a country And when that country had problems and needed help they need telemetry they need analysis the people said I don't deal with those people so  there is a relationship here in which the local governments themselves should try to encourage a certain level of protection to say, that is, it is not that they are going to stop you Two policemen in front of the house, but to say, that is, we are not going to go against you for  This is important to create that shape, so to speak. Not now, we have talked about the fact that a lot of specialized talent is required. This is super difficult for many countries, but I think not here. In other words, we have a lot of parallel talent that is not necessarily focused on this industry, but the amount  of researchers researchers involved in issues of offensive malware vulnerabilities in renting is a similar talent  ar but with a different focus For which I think that in a certain way we are in a good position to get into an industry that is Generally remote pays well they need edges keep it in mind That is, it is not just Security There is a lot that a reverse engineer can do  getting into this in this field but I think it is seen as something difficult to access as a project if we are not going to get into the issue of giving away the information to a total virus, which I understand Although I prefer that they do it, it is important to create certain  services a certain way of creating a collection of malware fishing not to mention logs because obviously that carries a lot of information but especially for people who are in difficult situations who don't have serious resources opposition political activists people who get a lot of this and don't know where  put it if they don't trust international resources there is no problem but let's create local resources because at the end of the day  if i decide i want to work for free to serve the region i have nowhere to go to get information so even for us to empower ourselves we have to do it a certain way and well the quick wins thing i hope it's not something you hear a lot  I think it's something from there or that they always have to bring up the issue of we're going to have quick wins, which means never having slow wins, but I think it's also very important to create this type of reward cycle, that is, we create certain work and  something came back valuable positive on this issue I really forgot to put a photo but we must recognize this network group in Mexico that has dedicated itself to doing these investigations the issue of that as a local issue in a government that is not necessarily very friendly  to what is happening there but I think it is something of inspiration if it is if in those circumstances they can dedicate themselves to such a difficult subject I think that too  We can also do it in our respective countries, here comes the question of where we are aiming and all this has been super academic theoretical in the air. So we are going to land the plane ideally with something a little more interesting and I give them the choice of exactly how much they want to get into  In this matter, let's not start with the easy, the easy and I see Fabio here in his line here in the second row, Roberto Martínez is also here at a certain time we worked in the same team focused on Latin America and I do not remember the first wish in  The one we work with locally is the famous machete, which is still monitored bachata. It's interesting, let's be real, it's not the best malware in the world, it's a large operation, probably a military one of interest in this region, and it stops counting, that is, in a certain way, most of the  focus is here now from time to time an international company appears that takes notice that you are making a machete but you don't need it.  Essentially it is a constant follow-up, an understanding of the situation that the actor, the group, the attacker is doing, at any time, and how we handle the situation.  Poseidon which was interesting I think it is the only apt that has sued us at some time well let's go to the next level and this will go into abstraction in a certain way more difficult but ideally more interesting Lorenzo francescaray good at that time motherboard do you live I don't know  if you know him he and I are working on a book together on the subject of hacking team I think it's a fascinating story they didn't create a market I think with the right motivation and we can see the history of this company from start to finish in a certain way and  see everything that happened in large part Thanks to Phineas Fisher but I don't know this link, that is, this was reported  ation will not be maximized even to 10% of what it entails Although hacking has died in quotes, good time continues in Arabia alone etc. But let's say it is not the company it was before, it gave us a gigantic gift unattainable unthinkable in certain ways that is it gave us a list  of clients, people with whom they had negotiated or contracted military police intelligence organizations around the world and I think it is important to highlight them, not because they necessarily go against it, but because it gives you an idea of ​​exactly which organizations, at least until 2013 14, have  They had the motivation, the resources, the interest to participate as attackers and many of them may be doing it for the right reasons.  go against threats I think good pedophiles etc. I think we all agree with  to persecute them but this was not the way in which the tools were used in most cases and the only way to know is to investigate If you look closely at the hacking team link we can see that almost all of Latin America tried or contracted the services in  certain cases they hired Team and Fisher in other cases also in that or they had resources to say enough to get into this issue and sometimes we think that the countries well our small country without resources do not have for these things Ethiopia prefers to hire hacking Team than to fix  the streets So let's not put those ideas in our heads either until now we review two parts there in the research topic first what were their operations now we know that all the hacking team camps have a specific watermore from which client it came from so that they can  know when the ones in Saudi Arabia had inadvertently put the malware in total and be able to call the client and say why  please don't make this joke again but which implies that now that we have the list we can see all the saints that have been seen in the last 10 years and say Ok these were the ones from Colombia the ones here are the ones from Mexico etcetera etcetera that job I don't know  He has done it just in case someone is bored and the big question is when assimilating this Where are the Now list, that is, the Village One special where all the intelligence agencies that were involved in this subject left, in certain cases we changed their names  but they are still in the same building no and well let's say enough now we are going to the last level in which I dare here I do not know if anyone has had the pleasure of having gone to Black hat in 2016 if I remember correctly people tell them in Claudio  marrion talked about a group that was called that they called homeland that in our time we talked about we called it popetier I was quite resentful since I had this presentation ready about  spa peter and they came out with the report I said Well we are not going to talk about the subject anymore but more to be hurt personally I thought it was a super interesting report but it precisely lacked that knowledge of the local to understand the countries that had been violated  to understand the issue of politics that was super emphasized in every aspect of the attacks from what they saw in the report we are talking about a group that was at least seven years old from 2008 to 2015 lousy malware, that is, the type of nonsense that  You can download purchases for 50 dollars from the internet. I am not telling you that they are going to have fun doing the reversing and many, that is, they were. We are not talking about the group because their tactics are extremely advanced but they are effective if it is enough. Something that seems very interesting to me is  that even on that date they worked a lot with the issue of disinformation and media manipulation they created false media as information leaks create fa stories  lsas about the opposition to the government in each country and it was part of either the attack or the service they provided And this is something that I believe with all due respect to Jason Claudio Mario, they seem to me to be excellent reisers but by not understanding what is happening in each  One of these countries is very difficult as a foreigner to say well These are from this group and on this date such a thing happened and the opposition went against Whatever at a certain time they are very difficult things to understand as a foreigner part of what is interesting about packard is  precisely that if one can, one can see the demogranular victims attacked both sides of each country, it was not that the government of let's say Venezuela was attacking the opposition, it was that they were attacking the opposition and they were attacking the government at the same time.  in each of these countries. So I think it was a very confusing dynamic for the people who were investigating that to say well who are we dealing with today and the chall comes  enge not for interested people who would be interested in doing this attribution work and I am not going to solve it for them maybe if we get bored enough in a month we write a blog together but I am not going to solve it what I am going to give is indications that I know  they lost to people from outside why Because they wrote the report they said super interesting we did the talk in Blackjack and I'm leaving and the next time I'm going to work on Asia I'm going to work in North America Russia Ukraine whatever you want and one will  forget about what happened here and not having a local follow-up not having an interest in continuing the work this report fell and there is no blog that I can find that follows the work after this and that is where we failed to keep track  to a true monitoring of local interest that should be of interest to our governments For our companies for the stability of our social organizations then here comes the challenge the h  hypothesis or the two hypotheses with which they tried to fight at that moment was that States What is the nice way of saying they worked for a government or not and I would like to give them a third option it is because not both and it is not by looking for it as we say the  fifth leg to the cat but because there are things that have changed since 2015 who have not been taken into account and I am going to point them to one thing about my beloved Ecuador when the administration changed there were many political fights between the previous government the next one the one that follows  all the people who hate someone there who did not agree did not agree I do not get into the subject of politics there for many reasons but something super interesting happened that was the case little walk as they told you and I am going to give you a summary  super short since everyone has Google and can start to investigate but the issue of the caminito case is that the director of local intelligence, that is, the director of cenaim, they tried to put a  embezzlement charge based on the fact that they said that a series of payments had been made to an individual who did not exist and their idea when trying to review the finances was that he should have been there.  he paid so and so and he was putting it in his pocket That was the idea in How they understood it from outside and since this was a classified operation it was very difficult to reconstruct if it was true it was not true who was telling the truth etc. what is interesting is  that as part of the defense of Pablo Romero they decided to remove the classification on the subject and we came to understand that only from the government of Ecuador a total of almost 14 million dollars was paid to an individual called the Russian that Russian has nothing  and the reason why it was thought to be false since the passport was false This is not a person that exists there is no Edward Soler I think the photo is true but the passport does not exist  This and what I leave you with is a couple of things of interest. First, Pablo Romero started talking about who the guy is and they named him. I'm not going to name him, but you can find him, and second, remember that Packard is the operation in which  we started talking about who had hacked nisman who had hacked the government of ecuador who was hacking the position in Venezuela there are many points of interest with this group we have the technical report of 7 years of operations and we have insiders who are starting to talk  what was happening And the clue that I give you is that we have both parts of the story and we need someone who understands the local issue to put it together and that is my challenge so far happy hunting and welcome to the topic of intelligence threats [  Applause] If you have any doubts, I'm sorry if you have questions, you can approach the microphones that are in the first row, that's where the questions come or not.  Juan Andrés Ah Well here's the first question something something easy Well thanks for the talk one of the things that as an intelligence analyst And looking at these not always in the field of analyzing local things one of the things that jumps out and that is  discuss a lot is good What is my personal risk and I think that as always investigating external threats that happen in other countries is much safer than analyzing something local where there can literally be a physical risk [Music] a high cost for as a researcher seeing the experiences that  They have people who report vulnerability and things like that, how they treat them when one starts on this side, how does that appear, not what is your opinion in that sense, how is it great? But there is a cost, how much do I have to risk to get into this and  not pay that much let's say well let's deal with it honestly first of all obviously I don't have any sense of survival to come here and play this tea  ma so I don't think I'm the best person to tell you how you should protect yourself, however what I can say is so far what we've seen is apart from certain special cases, an analyst working on these things hasn't really been touched, he doesn't want to  say that it cannot happen but in a certain way advertising and working in the public sphere is something that not only gives you some protection but begins to bring out what you did not expect, for example, the subject of metadora that we did this analysis recently was partly in  Spanish and we suspect that there were some possibly Argentineans issued on the subject but also Americans and Americans with language that suggests that they possibly worked in the intelligence community of the United States in a certain way we have no idea we don't know who they are a lot of people see that and say  we are not going to publish on this topic I am a little more I do not know I do not know what the word reckless is careless but it seems to me p  But it seems to me that the right thing to do as analysts is not to put that filter on, go personal and move forward and it turns out that we put this forward, many people that you would not expect came out to get into the super interesting topic of surgery, start thinking about this project Raven topic  Dark matters et cetera leads us to something that is going to become very familiar to us here what about the people we train who work in intelligence agencies in the military services who learn to run these operations they know how things work in their country and they come out of the  service in certain cases they will be here they will create companies to do retining and they will be part of normal society in and certain other things so what I am trying to say is that it seems to me that it is the right thing to do and that in a certain way  I do not think that people should go out and do it alone if there are risks, for example, Mexico has hardly touched on intelligence issues, threats and the most  Most of the time why because people said well we have employees in Mexico we can't risk it we don't know who is behind it and well yes there is a certain reason but it doesn't seem to me that we should leave so much of the history of humanity coming to this as we say  the Main effect in the United States we say that it is the fifth domain of warfare the only unclassified history of what is happening in that domain are those blogs and reports and the things that we put on the internet and sometimes on Twitter that we cannot find and nothing of  That story is being written here so I'm not saying it's a sure thing Although it may be something lucrative I think it's a Spanish word I'm not sure about lucrat something in lucrat but it seems to me that it's something correct and that it should be done ideally we do it as  group and we defend ourselves together thank you yes we have yes finish early Thank you very much thank you See my question is more related to the one you mentioned  You're going to have me with the Chilean accent. Sorry for my doubt. It's related to what you teach me about the policies that have to go to the government level, such as laws.  information gathering but what should be done to be able to take an action because one thinks that perhaps the most drastic measure would be to do what China does what Russia does perhaps having an average almost taking over the entire network and for them to filter all the information because in the end  In the end, this is how they obtain information and they can also have analysts where they make decisions mostly as you mentioned about all the steps and all the information that is needed But obviously there too We are talking about a restriction of perhaps a suffocation perhaps of the people who wanted And then  According to you, what would be like maybe a balance or if that is the best method to arrive at no I am not saying that it is the best method OR  Let's see the question as I understand it, it comes from two sides, not as a topic of that good, let's say politics, and as a topic of telemetry, organization of how a network is managed, the topic of managing the network, I can tell you at least the point of  In view of the United States, sometimes we are jealous of China because it was, I mean, the Chinese can at least kick in someone's door and say, do you know that you take that server out of me, that's it, that's it. No, we don't have that power in the United States, we would like to have it.  Sometimes when we know that the right thing to do is go and unplug a server and the threat is over, but I think it would lead to other problems in society for which we are not prepared. I'll put it another way, think about the example I said about my school close  The network, as Russia intends to do it, as China has already done, does not stop most of these threats and what it does centralize a lot of information in the hands of one of the institutions that does not need  They certainly have the best resources to manage, so there are other ways to do it, for example, the United Kingdom took a lot of talent from Jesse who created the mcd, which is something more public that allows you to work with companies that do they have information about the dns about everything that  it passes from the networks of this Island to the rest of the world and they look for ways to take that information hand in hand with people from the private sector and work with them together. So, which entails, we have a natural motivation if I bring something to the government they will  to give something to me in others we work together each one better and at the same time I have that protection that relationship that understanding that we are working in an aligned way it seems to me that the issue of protection is mentioned because I know that we in our countries treat the services  of intelligence in a way that is different from what is expected in the United States and Europe, that is, I am not that good. I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not  I am so naive as to think that everything is the same, but in a certain way I think that there is a natural motivation for governments to have these resources at hand, that is, they are the first to attack. Here they are to the governments.  that we have enough We know what we are doing you guys stay there leave us alone no one does it there are people who, that is, start to see how many collaboration centers have been created only in the United States, even more so in every country in Europe but rather collaboration centers that come every  company please sit down with us and tell us that they see what they can do how we work together So you don't have to create a protective law But you can create certain open links that give you visibility to both what the government wants and what we do between advertising  and the circle I believe that a more or less effective healthy ecosystem can be created Not necessarily but that's what  It takes trying to create something new. Well, I think they told me that the talk is over, but hey
