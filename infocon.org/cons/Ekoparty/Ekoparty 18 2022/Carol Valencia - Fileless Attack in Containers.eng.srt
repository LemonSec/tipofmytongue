We welcome Carol Valencia with a round of applause [Applause] Hi, can you hear me? OK, good afternoon, how are you doing? A pleasure to be here, Carol Valencia.  Latin America in our good our first my country but it feels very close there is not at least speaking in Spanish and also being able to have the pleasure of meeting foreign guests in other languages ​​so I really congratulate arecopar and any other event that we can help including our participation Because  It is important that our Hispanic community also grow sometimes, for example, I am going to give an example that sometimes we can have immigration problems to go to other events that are in the United States or Canada, so it is really important to start having high-quality events in Latin America to  that even people from Europe or from or  other continents In the end, everyone is going to enjoy a little Latin America is not one of those who is not going to enjoy a little change of culture Well then, after my thanks to this event and having the opportunity to meet several people, I am going to talk about what  What would files Attack be like in containers? Generally, the file part is better known in Windows and here I am going to specify a little more how it would be in Linux and an example in containers because in the end the containers are based on Linux technology, not so well I think  when Now it was it will be that it's going I'm not feeling control here for a moment I think my computer is slow Well I'm going to come back here in the little introduction just to say that I really like the Open source community because it has helped me a lot we found in the  community quite a few nice people who help us So I really recommend you to participate to people who are starting  Currently, he also participated a lot in the cncf, well, I try to participate. So that symbol that looks like a robot that is there the second means the Release of 1.24 of gubernet, I help in the Spanish translation part for the documentation of cure once and almost you too  If you are interested, please, look for me or you can enter the slacks themselves and there are many initiatives, such as Translating security wipers that are created in English to our Latin or Portuguese language as well and, well, a little about me, I work more as a Cloud architect  Maybe that's my path that I come from development a little more focused on the cloud part and now on the Claude Security part and I like tropical climates I definitely don't like cold This is going to be what I am going to deal with in my  Talk basically it is because there are many security tools using epf technology so I am going to give an introduction to what it would be  or then entering what is a definition of what is a friars Attack maybe many people have already heard it no who has already heard files Attack raise your hand to see I see that most of us are here in a security environment So it's good  common Maybe a little more in Windows and as we know the definition is that they are not using the files part and They are probably going to use legitimate programs to be able to do the execution that is more reliable my finger than him So this would be the part of one of  the definition of what would be Attack steaks sometimes the antivirus part will not detect because they are using the memory part for the execution of their processes they are known as no no malware Or zero Food print can go on to the next and well maybe  They are also known as Living of the Land Because they can live among us without us realizing it. Generally, attacks made in files are like a wolf in sheep's clothing.  means that they can be years of years and sometimes they are not detected so that is why they are also known as living of the Land in this case in that example that I am placing the references of how that author created the persistence part using Windows and the part  from register So you can see it, that's why it's State file with persistence and even there is an example made in Windows using a legitimate program that would be the power shell, they are also known as apts that would be persistent advances So when we see that we have an attack like this  type Generally they are between nations or between important governments a famous case of friars is that operation cobal Kitty that was more than a year until it was not detected [Music] running and executing in their systems so that is why it is known as cobal Kitty  because in the end it is always like a game that is hiding inside the system and the fileless USA part Like for example  or Power shell or wmi in Windows to do this part of attacks so here we see the part of Power Power again using a legitimate program to be able to inject some payload or cover strike which are other famous programs in the blueting part that it does  the exploration part So, as you can see, they use legitimate programs and with that they manage to reach the execution part and now I am going to explain a little what it would be like.  when we talk about files in Linux we are going to have the one that helps to load the dlls of the non-church ones I am in Windows the one for preload that helps with all the links you need Maybe a process then a way to inject  at the time of execution the part of Price which is another ciscol within Linux which is widely used for part of divac And we have the part of menu ef of create which is another  Cisco What is it that I am going to use it for my demonstration the part is also going to allow us to execute a descriptor file in memory in memory so we see that we are going to have these stages first we go due to some bad configuration in our machine this is going to  have the input of a hacker actor or a bad actor and then they can use these artifacts like the dipload price to get the files part of execution and at the end you always see the part of the ciscol call display to do itself the execution no  So Those are the common steps that you are going to see based on that based on that is that when I read this this this report there is no that says smartwatch files running in containers I wanted to understand a little more How this part is executed So when I went  entering a little more that is this next one So as we can see there are already attacks in the Wild as they say using the part of files against the internet This is a report  You can do it later, the security people can go in and see in more detail how it is and here [Music] a part that I want to highlight, which is why I put it up, is that we generally have our security scanners, we can do the scanning  same as this and executed in a virtual machine and not in a container and it is not a container scanner specifically it will not be detected because they are legitimate processes For example I am going to use a Coleman systems it is not a vulnerability in which a static analysis  It is going to say that it is a critical vulnerability No, that is what that part means and here is an example that is part of the image that is already embedding the part of this of this of this binary he explained to me there to execute it that we are going to do it  Let's see later but basically what it is is my final image that I'm running with a static analysis and it doesn't really present a vulnerability because it's u  In a legitimate process, these things cannot be detected, this would be because of zero detections, which is related to the previous slider attack. This is what I am going to develop a little in my presentation.  attacks on files and we analyzed a bit the part of the code that was done in this friar he's going to have the execution itself which says run Ram from Memory which says the second part execute Memory he still has an encryption pass on top of this binary to  to be able to hide better and my demo I'm not going to do the encryption part so I'm just going to do the execution part in files so in the original attack he still uses that encryption part there we can see the algorithm and the execution itself  of files that celebrate from Memory that would be the part of my code that I placed inside my container So as you can see the first step is going to be a circus  He's calling the F create menu to create the descriptor file and then he's going to inject a hair of a process and it's going to end up executing So this is a real example of that code was on the internet and someone found it.  started using to start hacking Here we see a bit of the definition of create So as we can see it will create an anonymous descriptor file that will be in the part of my memory which will allow us to save some hair in this file  descriptor that I am creating and then executing it, there are several ways to create the files part in Linux but if we see This was one of the easiest because I only have to call it and it does all the work for us So that's just to remember that this  It is the first one, this is one of the most important steps within the program and now I am going to explain a bit about the part of fpf that is being used a lot in the security part, observability in everything that  ue is within containers Linux gobernats and it is because it allows us to see all the events that are happening in El Carmen probably people who already work with security at the level of Linux systems are used to it or the lkm part of load Ball carnal models Only that  with the technology of Ever and PDF which is part of the Linux carnal we can create programs inside a Linux carnal an easier way that's why it comes with a process it comes as if it were encapsulated not and it has a verifier part Because if we also put  imagine programs within the kernel we can break the user's operating system So he already comes with a better architecture thinking that we can continuously load programs within the Linux kernel and with that start monitoring events according to what we  Interested, so that's why we'll see, I'm going to do an example of detection with mpf with three bpf solutions to be sure.  ity that would be falcon Tracy and to Show how they are using this part of fpf in this specific case of detecting the free create memes and maybe just for just Highlighting here that if you see the System calls part it is only as an abstraction layer  of communication between the user and space of carnal Space and when we talk about rpf you can call to communicate with these systems but there is a lot of instrumentation inside the car so it can not only be communication with System scores it can also be with carnal Funes that is why we see  all those terms of trans because it is already the world of Linux instrumentation so systems only a small part of that world that would only be like the communication layer O layer yes between user space and carnal Space so that is why when explaining to you entering  to understand for people I am also learning a little before ebpf When we do a program of fpf pr  ograms we are going to listen a little more to those parts of carnet fusions socket because they are different parts that implement the Linux carnet and according to that we can create a Hook which would be from the bpf terminology to be able to capture that specific part so there also comes a  It can be said complexity that you have to know a little more about Karla's developers understand more than a knowledge of Linux to do that part of bpf programs here for example this here we are looking at a 3 Point which is one way you can do a caprut  What would be another way to implement within bps what we are seeing on the left side like Dash net pros exit are functions within the kernel that we can create hooks to connect with that specific part to start on that create the mpf programs that would be when we see a  solution like tracy falco what they are doing is programming all those parts each in a different way because you can have  er an approach depending on what they want to capture, everyone can go for different approaches and an epf lucasso program is created here I am highlighting the exact part of that Tracy sketch process a bit because as you can see it can be complex even when we go sometimes it is like a  middle path there are problems and problems of how they can do a bypass within security so here it is talking that for example if you do a cooking you only try to do a bpf program in a specific case that is more touched on in ciscols Maybe it is more appropriate  do it by 3 points mode because he manages to capture you or other parts that would not be that in that specific case against the limitations that one gives you then it is already more to understand which approach one is going to use in the definition of his program  This is just a parenthesis so that you can see that sometimes the decisions within the bpf programs are a little more complex and it also depends  well from the security team security and also technical knowledge in the Linux part to understand all the bypasses that you can do when you are going to try to capture does not exist and try to evade it so here are the logos of the Open source products that I used and the  idea was to detect this specific part as Main Fly create no So as you see those are what the suspicious behavior would be first I'm going to have a call The System call from men F create I'm going to write to that end of writer which is in Memory some  non-dangerous content then what would be the famous payloads injections that I write then I have a right action and I think it executed that call in a project that already exists in a process that already exists For example I am going to create in an enginex image  So the process would be enginex and there I inject anything that comes after one of any lf so that's why it says display name se disp  lay name can be for an active process, which is why I make the injection in some process that is already running. I know that this process is running because it is placing in the part of the proxer file descriptor which is a folder that Linux uses to  the processes part then following that part of my suspicious behavior no So see here the source code everything is in that project that is I am placing the lax from my repository So all the details can be seen there including the doctor file and the idea is that  i am running an enginex i add this compiled code after i run my ram from memory binary i put it inside my image to start using it which was included in the previous slide i did scan over this image version and it has the above steps that would be  menén Well here would be the architecture of one of the programs that would be falco So as you can see We are always going to talk  in mpf both user space carnal space and everyone has their architecture of how they are placing the rules as they are interpreting because it is not only creating the program once you create the program You also have to create the rules that will identify that suspicious behavior  in that case we see that the rules are going to be in the part of the user space snake the rule engine Here is how I configure my rule in the part of falcó so I could also try to detect the part of the create system only in this specific case they still don't  They also support the details, they can even see there in falcon md that you enter the community, they will see that the discussions that exist in this specific case are not detected, so they will probably make a public and then support in the fricurate part, basically this rule  It is the rule that they have to make spawn detect processes that are being scared on a mac and I am only  Of course, I am only detecting the part of and the part of processes that it does not have, that is why the part of your event enters here we can see the output, so here is the animation that is being executed. So you see that I execute my container, I call my binary  that I placed that is called demo men Fried I tell him that the process that I want to do the injection is called enginex because it is a ginext image and I can execute the truth I am executing Bin from there more could be well ls well Anything or a malware by  that is that you can execute it and see if at least your security tools detect this injection in memory mode in that injection. Then you see that there they indicate the descriptor that is reading and in the part of the output of falco as my rule still  it is only detecting the part of excepbe it still has a lot of noise, not that it could be together with other processes it is not detecting Only only the part of me  execution also captures other things because the rule is not yet very well defined and here I am going to go to the next part which would be the next project 13 dragon So tetra how is it a relatively new project in the community because falco already has more than four  years ago it has quite a few security rules in its repository I bring you it is new and perhaps the highlight would be that they placed in the part of their rule to place the rules within their own that they call it Smart collector So you are going to see that there is a  a bit easier to program a bit maybe the rule But one has to implement it for example and it doesn't have many security rules either So it's like the program is there for you to use but you have to have security and instrumentation knowledge  So for example in this specific case your files that I am doing So how do I know that I want to detect the part of the eas  Coleman F create and xxv I place it and they have the feature that would be Kill, so it matches my rule, in this case the male is matching the part of my rule that is the proxer because I know my code and I know  that I am placing the proxer part so I am going to tell him to kill it of course anyone who is also a hacker or not is going to look at my rule and is going to be able to do a bypass by creating one more path and that's the rule  it's blocked so that's why even They have now it's also in my annotations of this dragon they have a public is doing the detection with inote with inode to improve another security approach that doesn't allow those bypass parts here I'm doing the same thing no  I run the binary I give enginex which is my same image but there we can see that since it has that Kirk action it gives the finished command and the next one will be Tracy in that case Well let's see that it also has the d part  etection also using mpf they have the rule creation part can be done using Opa which is Open police town hall wowland and I'm going to pass here that Tracy's case I didn't have to write the rule because it was already there so it was just more the work of  see how I could execute or if they detected using the other tools then in the project you bring and what you have is a part of signatures that would be the security rules to detect malicious behavior in that case it would be 105 even now last I know that they placed more  30 rules so Whoever has whoever is from Security can go see so I'm going to explain a little more what they did So as you can see here He is using a 3 Point for them or the theory he gave before you bring him Point of bpf for  the exeg processx part and based on that they get to get all those arguments start mapping the path system dumen Fried and the other  ras that would be the first two parts and the other two are from shm ram because they are other ways where they can write the memory part so it is also mapping other cases that may occur So as we see Sometimes seeing a little bit the hacker deeply understands a specific case  or the person can find a way to make a bypass create in others elsewhere so here I am using the same example I am not going to execute and there it is doing the detection part based on that rule Here it is already giving the output here is  in the detection mode that it simply gives to the user it is not if someone identifies a behavior, we have the other mode that would be more for the forensic part or the research parts that is why I have put it there than if one uses the Tracy project in mode  mpf is going to start giving you all the events that are actually being captured by the project in this case it is even capturing imagine that I am going to do a car download a  payload a binary then one can do the capture based on various parameters, for example, capture only what is being executed in memory or capture a Ketchup that comes based on a container output. It has many filters so that you can filter all the information from the  from the meat of events that a lot of information really comes if you just Execute it without even a filter that maybe and Well here we can see the vision of a real attack that was So how can it be the nt dye that is well famous in the part  from Cloud that always have a lot of attacks and he uses a legitimate process that could be the swing router that we see that these are processes that are a natural part of the operating system, no, and then there is that process where it makes the injection, which would be like  mianginex no instead of closing it would be an ex and the part of execution and memory binary wicker Only that specific part would be the demo  from my image but there we see that they still use the part of the packets that was the encryption to make it more difficult to detect and there they can execute it instead of executing a Bin day they can execute a cryptomanner being executed in memory on the other side we see that we also have  the rootkins part so really the attacks that can be can be really more complex and with that I'm really coming to the end of all that security process that I don't I don't come from security I'm not a security expert but when one tries to be deep  in understanding at least what an attack is like, we see that even in the blogs themselves or the Security research and all they were always finding, it could only be detecting the display part or something and you see that someone says No, but you can do the bypass and  fal memories you can use this form and another so it's really like entering a and it's a game like cat and mouse really in that world of  e security even if the rule is published it is easy to bypass or as someone told me in the case of cbps programs this You know what they are detecting what they are capturing so you could try to do the bypass part of course more is required  knowledge But hey, everything is possible and in the end, simply my thanks to all these projects that they helped me with. When I went, I asked how do you do this, they helped me a little to improve the rules. So I always recommend consulting the community part and  well, thank you very much for being here in the present tense. well, if anyone has questions to ask during the hand, if they can't get closer, line up at the microphone that is in the middle. Hello, interesting. I wanted to ask you three things. The first is that for these tools that  requirements the carnal had to have. For example, if he had to only have dps enabled or he also had to have  some back settings in the configuration no I mean when El carnal was seen if I had to have for example here 3 you need to confirm so to know this I hook you up with the second question if these tools can be running continuously on a production Server because it depends  from the first question is how I had to compile the carnal if for example a carnal of the seaf from alpine or one of these You already have the necessary ones those first two questions OK Yes excellent question and that really has quite a difference between the three three projects Why  example I know that I think that you dragon supports only the most modern versions because they use more keyproops Only in the case of Tracy Most of the new meats already come with the btf flag support by default So they already support rpf programs but I know that  in the case of Tracy They also have a part of bilton onward which is a project that they do the compilation for  to be able to support in those meats that do not support btf by default and to be able to use this technology, the carnel can be used by a dioga-enabled card or that kind of thing No, it is not recommended for production, well, that part of production in Open source version as it is  eh I don't know if it is so mature even in the Dragon Tracy part there is no documentation how to run it in production it is more like forensics maybe there you have to go in the Enterprise version they already give you support for that than if we are now talking about production  It's already a bit different, Nene, from the part that security gives you, what stability does support give you, then also, and some possibility of analyzing this statically by seeing the sequence of calls, first identifying the ciscol and then seeing what is done in the rest of the program.  requires Hall program analysis and all that but do you have any idea if there is someone doing that with static analysis What would be the definition of static analysis  or for you to execute it Simply by assembling and compiling The binary or that kind of thing, no. In other words, looking at the binary without the need to execute it, there are quite a few solutions that do static analysis Only some, for example, this example of files only goes  to happen when it is executed, then someone active is needed to monitor the processes that are happening. So, the definition of ramtime from Trenting Tools or dynami canal would be for me and that Dynamic analysis is a nice challenge. I think it can be detected statically. I have heard  I have heard about projects, for example, it is an interesting approach that would be to try to execute on your developer side to see the behavior of how it is done and try to see some behavior to anticipate then, but it is something new type No I have not seen it very mature Yes in the market  Good afternoon, excellent discussion. My question is based on your experience creating rules, it would be more  It's very complicated to create specific rules for known vulnerabilities, that is, for some cb and detect them that way in memory rather than through dependencies or for specific exploits, so being able to make a specific rule for an exploit that is published that well has a Food  memory print that when it is running, well, it could be found No, how complicated would it be to build those rules? Well, really good, speaking of bpf, the part of knowledge in Linux, schools, including kernel instrumentation is required, which is relevant to be able to detect behavior. So I  I really saw two things that help or that is complex: first, the knowledge in the Linux Channel and second, the knowledge of a Security research for that part that knows how to identify. For example, I can know how to program in the Linux kernel but I don't know what the  Serial actions that, for example, are going to form my sign, not the famous signat  ures then there I require the famous securizonte So maybe that's why I also began to value the Security Resort steam team a lot because maybe in companies we only have a security team or we don't even have so the part of Security Resort change is  the one that is going to develop this part of signatu is going to be even seeing what is in the Wild to be able to create these these rules with the available technologies that help us in this case bpf because it would be like in the old way the programming card  a kernel the net module which is the lkm which was the old mode only now it can be programmed with fps any questions I'm also here walking and I'm in the Aqua Booty and this I would stay here too we say goodbye to take it out With a big round of applause
