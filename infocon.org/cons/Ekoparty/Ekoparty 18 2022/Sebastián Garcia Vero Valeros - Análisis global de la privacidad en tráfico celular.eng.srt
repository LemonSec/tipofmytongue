So I ask you please if you can sit down and also if we can give you a round of applause well hello hello good thank you very much for coming the truth is that it is a joy to be here at the Eco not only in person but with so many people but  It's beautiful beautiful for me for us I think I can come back and see you and be there and participate Thank you very much thank you very much for coming for sitting down Thank you very much to everyone who made this possible it makes us very happy The truth is that we are going to start with an analysis  global privacy in cellular traffic and how are you at risk of surveillance My name is Verónica Valeros I am a security and digital threat researcher at the Technical University of the Czech Republic in Europe I work analyzing digital threats from malware and a lot of other things I am also  project leader our stratosphere research lab and now I'm doing a master's degree in intelligence And I'm  security studies at the university of Liverpool so good going back to the roots to study My name is Sebastián García I am the project manager at the Technical University of the Czech Republic where we use our knowledge in Machine learning and security to help  the community is one of the things we do and that's me Maty is a historian, investigative journalist from Morocco, he spoke a lot or against the government and that's why the government tried and at the time to infect him with the pegasus spyware Unfortunately he was very persecuted  and they put him in prison for his activism and he was only released very recently at the beginning of the year Alberto nisman if you are from Argentina you probably know about the case Argentine prosecutor worked investigating the cases of amia he was infected with spider-man we don't know very well Probably yes but  we don't know he was murdered or committed suicide seven years ago and still today seven years later there is no ab  absolutely no investigation or case or beginning to resolve what happened he is a human rights activist also from the united arab emirates he worked hard at his job writing articles also opposing the government at one point he became the million dollar dissident no  I know if some of you remember because the government paid a million dollars to buy the pegasus license to infect it try to infect it with this spyware that it tries to find it tries to get information about your every move everything that happens on the phone there were several attempts  At one point Unfortunately they captured him and put him in prison Obviously he was found guilty of something and was sentenced to 10 years in prison Many years of this sentence were in complete isolation He recently turned 53 He is in very fragile health And he is still in prison  Simón Barquera is a researcher is a Mexican scientist  who worked hard analyzing and was taxed on soft drinks in Mexico and the government decided to infect him and attack him with the pegasus spyware luckily Simón is free and from what we know Karla Salas is a lawyer defending Human Rights in Mexico surely some of  You know her or have heard of her because I was investigating the disappearance and murder of students in Mexico and she was infected by Pegasus by the Mexican government in order to have first-hand information about the investigation she was conducting. Griselda Triana Griselda was the wife of  a person who also supported the Mexican government and her husband was murdered and ten days after her husband was murdered she was infected with pieces to reveal her movements and to know everything she was doing in her search for Justice for the murder of her husband and  Emilio Aristegui at the time he was infected with the pegasus spyware he was a m  Underage, he was the son of a lawyer who was also doing investigations that affected the Mexican government and because of his closeness to his mother, he was infected by the government with spyware to listen to everything he chose to do when he was near her.  Mom, that's terrible, no, he's of legal age and he's already had interviews telling a little about his story. The problem is that these are only a very few of the people who were lucky enough to be able to show him their faces and their stories, but there are many.  many many more people are not the only ones attacked persecuted or killed for their work protecting our society This is the pegasus project the pegasus project that is a conglomeration of media organizations and journalists that through a leak of information about the company that makes pegasus  in Siout of Israel they leaked that there were 50,000 people on the waiting list to be infected with pieces and that they were the tests  possible new targets of this company or of the clients of this company, but it is not just malware, they are not the only risk that these people from civil society face, the Frontline Defenders organization published the 2021 report earlier this year and they reported  that more than 300 activists were assassinated around the world for their activism work Yes, these people that we need so much to denounce a lot of the things that are not going well in the world are being attacked not only attacked but also assassinated and the truth is  very sad to see that at the top of this list we find Colombia we find Mexico we find Brazil and other countries also in Latin America like Nicaragua like Peru and also Argentina Yes then there are a lot, a lot of risks that these people are going through and  As we say, just getting infected with malware is not the only method to keep watching you, there are other things that happen and when you  We have governments that are against the work you are doing, they can do other things to keep an eye on you, such as learning about your activities through network traffic. This is an example of what happens to your phone if you don't  they are using a VPN I know that all of you here are using La Viviana on your phones but if you were not or were using a VPN you would be there, you would be the person in black with the cell phone and what he is telling you is that if you are using a WiFi that  It does not have encryption so all the people around you could see the same thing that we saw in the analysis that we are going to show you if the WiFi you are using is encrypted which is the most common now then those people around you may not  see but the data is going to go to its worst internet is going to have a Seat ming and the internet provider can see all the data that you send through the sis admin usually in a gov  democratic law and through a judicial process the data can be accessed So justice and the police can access your data as seen by the internet provider in the case of an authoritarian government the whole government without any communication and by the  years that they are there they can access and I have made access to the data like the ones that we gained to see in the investigation today This only in your country because later they go to the rest of the world when they go to another web page So they travel the world  their requests and they arrive in the country where the website they want to enter is located and there they will have another one but right now the internet will also collect all the data and it will also do so and the judiciary or the police of a democratic government can access  to that data as well as an authoritarian government of the country where they are going to be able to access all the data that you are sending And of course the website itself through Susy Jazmín to  Through attackers there are many cases of attacked sites and the attackers collect the data of those who enter and very importantly all the advertisements and the Data Brokers that are working on that site will have access to the data as we are going to show now in the  in case they want to use a VPN or they have a VPN What happens is that all the local access all the local exit is going to be protected it is in little green they see that it is good green good red bad and now the people in the WiFi and in the  The internet operator and probably the local government cannot access it, but what is not forgotten is that after the VPN is the rest of the world and they will go back to the internet and providers and everything that happens in the destination country continues to happen  they can access your data AND they can access your userration if they can access the data they settle clearly using a VPN is a protection methodology when we want to protect ourselves from our government or d  in our local environment And that's important because it's where we move physically, it's where we want to have protection and the web pages we enter we still enter another so much we don't care the problem is that someone is always taking your data no matter what they do it doesn't matter  what phone they have no matter the provider someone is taking their data And this data will most likely end up in brothers of some organization or government So what we are left with is we can choose our own spy by the phone brand by the service we have by the VPN  that we use at least we know that someone is going to have the data well choose your own spy and that is at least the choice we have now it is wrong to think that this only happens in governments that are not democratic is this happens around I don't know in  Russia in Egypt in China in local or democratic countries everyone respects our data And the truth is that it is not like that there were many investigations  ones and reports in recent times denouncing large-scale and systematic data collection data capture programs Even in countries that are the cradle of democracy like the United States and other countries also in Europe in particular This is a case that happened not  it arrives in the area below it is September 21 20 22 we are talking about two months a month and a half a report came out from a well known company unfortunately called Team where they have a product called auguri and this product was sold to many agencies within the United States  United and the project or the auguri product says when they are going to sell it literally says that they capture data in pickup format of everything they see in many suppliers around the world and they literally say there is nothing more to capture than the smell of electricity  in those cables Yes and they say how the n6 was already under investigation for using cookies in this case they were from Facebook for ide  ntify and track their targets their surveillance targets capture all internet activity and say they have access to 93% of global internet traffic and this company that has these accesses was found selling the raw data to the US government  Nobody I find myself I am one in billions, yes, but you have to think about the particular case that we are presenting, the focus is on civil society, people who are not just any person, are people who annoy a government and governments collaborate with each other and it is very  easy to know Ah I'm looking for Sebastián Ok how do I find Sebastián it's much easier than analyzing the entire Data Corpus looking for something strange Yes then there is a misconception there that I do not hide in the data And that does not happen anymore if it is not  necessary to be infected in order to be monitored is only more efficient because when I infected someone with malware I know that I am infecting Sebastian and all  or the data that I collect, sorry, click here that the data is from Sebastián, these data are labeled and it saves me a lot of work, but it is not the only way and the problem with this is that this data is going to go to a government like  the government here and sometimes it's intentional and you don't know it's because Well, one out there has confidence in the government or out there you don't have the confidence of the government the real question is your data now that they are in this government are you going to trust the  next government and the one that comes and the one that comes and the one that comes and the one that comes and in 15 governments Because all those are going to have this same data of yours now then we cannot allow this work Only because we believe that the current government of the country can  be more honest than another So how can we help at the Technical University in the Czech Republic we developed this project called and within this project aimed at helping civil society c  let's see our services tvn is a service created to provide help to civil society by verifying mobile devices, they can also be computers, but it is focused on devices that one carries everywhere and to be able to tell them to give them a refund if these devices are infected with malware or are  at the risk of any other type of security problem including data leaks the process of this service is very simple the people who use our services connect to a VPN that is on our servers we root them to the internet safely and in the  means we capture traffic pickups yes they have all the information that people browse the internet once the VPN session expires we analyze the traffic and then we generate a report that is returned to the person saying ok I found threats from Malboro  I didn't find security issues or not or anything else we found  the skin margin It has different functionalities or features it is a VPN that works over tcp odp and with several different types of services it is almost anonymous because to request a VPN profile we need people to request it let's say we do not generate them and for that we need  that people send an email that they can create a fake email if they want and ask for a profile or we also accept orders through Telegram we also do an automatic analysis of the traffic that means we have programs like the slippel of the free software instruction detection system  running on the traffic reporting things automatically and the reports are also generated automatically but not only that we also have a verified analysis What does it mean that after the session expires and the automatic report is sent there are humans like me like Sebastian Like Mohamed our colleague  who look at the captures without knowing who they are from and they see  package to package 10,000 packages or 100,000 packages to be sure we didn't lose anything as I said before we accept by mail and Telegram and all this is powered by free software airbn is the new cvpn image engine that we can develop and publish it is on github  You can download it and install it. It is the software behind the cvpn margin service and we develop this open so that any organization does not have to trust us. Your organization can go install and generate its own cvpn image and be able to protect its employees.  With this service, eavpn implements Open VPN Walker and eduvpn has an automatic launch of services through dockers of the Telegram and email modular system and also automatic slips reporting and also Pijol for dns monitoring and also automatic blocking of trackers and advertisement there it is  You can download the QR it is not malware since 2019 that we started this service we have analyzed  more or less than a thousand devices around the world and that more or less to give you an idea is more than 19,000 hours and 600 gigabytes of network traffic Yes and we manually analyze all that data one by one so the idea for now from the rest of the  chola it's a bit to tell you what we saw what are the problems and where do we go from there so analysis of data leakage in people at risk Remember that this is not for all people our project but for those who are in  risk now traveling to a country that is somewhat compromising or in a situation where your life is at risk And we started with a calculator like you calculator that sends GPS data and it was good This is a calculator the real one is called calculator Plus is an application that is  for Android for iOS and this calculator when it is installed it uses the calculator and it also sends its location in real time every few seconds to some server on the internet if they look  down there I can't get to read them here but I tell you it says that there are more than a million installations of this application in the world only of one application yes we don't know why it does this we assume that it has this world clock and that's when  you need to know your location every 5 seconds but the amount of data that is filtered is very large But why then why is your calculator sending GPS data and the reasons are many marketing one because the application wants to work or its applications if they are here developing  applications you want to do marketing of your product you want to do this in the user and show them things depending on where you are in the world you want to make them have something special a social network that is also a reality this improved user experience when you want to carry out your application  a new rivals of people start taking private data they need to know who uses it where it is  even when they use it time of day also because many applications sell this data to the market, specifically they sell the data of citizens and private persons also for selling the advertisement, it is not advertising I have advertising on my product in my application and it is the advertising that  it takes all the data Because maybe they want to know telemetry the class it is How many people are using my application others do it simply out of maliciousness I want to steal all your data and steal your credit card it also happens many times or due to negligence companies Because they can take  all the data, even though you don't need it, unencrypted Remember that everything we see is because you are seeing it unencrypted So these are the five categories that we are going to use for our analysis, which is your location Remember the little map symbol the location personal identifiers Sorry in  location can be GPS but sometimes they send the city the  exact mailing address yes sometimes applications send your home address personal identifiers which can be these names documents email addresses and anything that can be used to identify you from another person private data that is based on the gdpr the law of  personal data European and here it has to do with all conversations political preferences sexual social circle IP addresses and a lot of things that are considered sensitive and private another category are the Software versions especially for attackers it is very important to know exactly what software you have and  The last one is mobile operators, which is who your local operator is in the place where you are. Imagine that all this collected is what one would more or less try to obtain in a penetration test recognition stage in any company. We try to see what it has  installed We try to see where they are from what religion they have no I mean all  This information is what we are looking for, no, and the Government already has it when we send things without encryption or the statistics of the amount of data are leaked. It is approximately this. This is of all the thousand and something devices analyzed, there are twenty something percent.  Of all the phones that we saw that are liquidating the location many times in real time, approximately 12% send unique identifiers that separate them from the rest of the population, there is 35% that send private data. So it's like the whole middle row.  from here all of you Sorry that it touched you but all of you are sending your private data at this moment with your phones This is the reality of what we see in our version analysis there are 11% of phones that send different detailed versions and finally around a  5% that is liquidating by filtering data from the mobile operator What applications send this data there are many many applications here we see  Some, like the NFL, some have it installed out there, some of us can do, we can't do a show of A Show of hands with each application we don't have, for example, games like Billy pood alibaba su Players vessing fit mitel people from Mexico surely know this  application some have it installed Yes yes I see that yes Live look at the icons he will tell you a little Which ones have GPS Which ones settle other types of data is an application to search for rentals check the location of where you are looking for the rental how convenient cellscher is  an application that is a security application that lets you search for fake phone cells but at the same time it is liquidating the location and a lot of other things. In other words, it is putting you more at risk than it already was by trying to be more secure  Microsoft and my similift 199 taxis are some applications like those that are to have the location not like the taxi that  well no Wait for it to be as well known as lift and do this this data filtering a lot of applications for the weather no meter weather Ah not another calculator Stream the world cleaner music players MercadoLibre buy online we are not saying that all versions of all  the applications of, for example, MercadoLibre or metro are liquidating data, yes, but there are so many scenarios available, both different hardware, so many versions that are coming out that some of them have been shown to liquidate data, we have the video and mpr downloader and there is a taxi Open weather, a well-known application as well  from weather TuneIn for music if anyone uses tinina here they can also uninstall at this time we should do a show outside of uninstalling apps who is installing I see some like this very fast typing I'm sure some use AccuWeather here yes sometimes cell phones use AccuWeather Although  you don't have the app  from AccuWeather not also lived in Mexico also sent unencrypted data quite large companies this particular application customized for Mexico yes we have more cool beans antivirus use browser alibaba app Mexico City Mexico the interesting truth the Mexico City app is used to find routes  Yes to search for services around a lot of unencrypted data there weather day and microclimat and the main application of aviaba but but no we don't have time to show them all and These are some of the icons yes like the Nike app like Spotify like Google Maps like many many  applications Ok cupid some here more importantly cell phone applications and since LG is all the applications that already come pre-installed it is not that one downloads it sometimes you cannot install them in the case of Samsung they are literally liquefied directly to Samsung Yes very important  This is the case of the Google app, which is used by Google for many of its  products and that it is also liquidating data and finally we did an Ok the whole company there is Gigi dot with all of them, that is, it is all of them if you even look at the same icon for many applications they are all games of things I have no idea but I am going to assume that  By the way, they liquidate a lot of data to all the people who install these game applications, let's see. I'm playing, it doesn't send anything, it sends everything, literally everything, from the time they manage to play, sometimes many of these game applications have an internal chat where you chat.  with participants from all over the world and sometimes many times those chats that you talk to people are all in plain text that goes to the internet and all the way through one server and another everyone can see it yes security applications we  we asked well what we use to secure our phones well not a couple of years ago and we conducted a data leak study leaked from  data in specifically in security applications such as antivirus applications of the 40 or more security applications a single one did not put its users at risk due to data filtering a single one and these are applications such as caspersky such as avg such as Avast such as sofos such as norton are these applications  with which one thinks that they have to take care of us, they do not have to put us at risk anymore so that they get an idea of ​​the situation of how serious this is, we dedicate ourselves here to making a security report of each of these applications of the problems  What we found takes more or less 8 hours. We have a report from all of us. We send all the reports. Only one antivirus company answered us three months after the report and told us This is not a security problem, it's a file, it's faster and look how difficult it is.  that is to fix these problems that these companies that know what they are doing because they work very well still have these filtering problems yes  These are examples Remember that we are working with people from civil society with activists with Human Rights Defenders with opponents So we are not going to clearly show private data but we want to give you an idea of ​​what it looks like and how this data liquefies what it is  what we see when we go to see that traffic This is the Epa of Google Maps Google Maps for some unknown reason or from the application or from lapi send this data here we have the Maps elevation the location and directly the GPS data of where you are and how they are  very fast very often here we have Samsung the devices Samsung contacts the Samsung server for a lot of things including updates lists of system applications that need to be updated etc. Unfortunately 99% of the Samsung phones that we investigate send these requests  to Samsung without encrypting Then we see all the URL that is sent to the device to the server  from Samsung and there Including the names of the packages that are installed on the phone we see the code of the specific version we see the device ID and we see other quite interesting things such as mcc and eminemc which are the code of the telephone provider  and the country code of the phone provider we see the code of the phone provider we see the version of sdk that the phone is using yes and all this data including the phone codes can be used to tell where people live yes the country code  Yes yes it can be 84 which is good Argentina and then the particle the particular code can say 06 which is clear Yes then I only know where you are In which country are you probably In which city what is your telephone provider from which I have to request data  or intercept or do something we have Spotify links in this case Spotify makes a link because it uses an advertising system in a company called scorecar res  ort.com and by Spotify or by the bookstores that this system uses advertising leaks a lot of data here we have to reduce it to be able to put it here but it is not only known that it is Spotify in Android 8 that value called C2 is a unique identifier of the  person who is anonymous sends your phone for some reason to the provider no 2224 to the advertising system Remember that through the Data broker is the advertising bash system to share this data with many hundreds of companies that buy this data and We have many more identifiers behind this  without encryption Yes yes of course other things I wanted to Show from Spotify I don't know if you look up there it says WiFi yes And it's because at all times Spotify is Sharing with this server by Albert ticing If you are connected to LTE or wi-fi the amount  of time that you are using the application yes And here we enter a different area which is not only do I know data about you let's say I know data about your behavior Yes so  If I change the phone tomorrow and someone is looking at the behavior, it is possible to compare two behaviors and say ok. I already have suspicions that all this data is from Verónica. It looks like Verónica that I had already collected that data.  we change our usage patterns Here is another application that cupid who has it installed is a dating application Oh I see a couple of hands this application also shares data with a server of Albert ticing here in this case Mob pop and we can see the same  the data of the phone the ID of the device but also other things If you pay attention the age of the person the gender if it is female male and the status Yes if you are Single married or it is complicated yes And this also liquefies the carriers that we saw before the mobile operators  and also the company that you can see there in this case that is the cel that also citizens this is an example of directly the s  Google site user content.com which is Google's official Claudia service to store all requests and data sent or received by the users of the application This is no longer your application but the users of your application every time you  they upload a photo a text something Google provides the service for this to be stored in the cloud and for your application to store all this what they don't tell you is first that they send it unencrypted and second that those links remain alive for the time that follows  This was months after the photo was sent and anyone with access to that link can see the photo in the future and see photos of you or selfies or whatever you uploaded yes directly a Google service the problem is very big giant no  We are the first to notice this, it is already being investigated, it was investigated in the past, it is very complex, these servers are the largest providers of personal data in the world, as they always say.  the common saying if it's free you are the product yes and the product this product our data our behavior is worth a lot of money Data Brokers are real professions is there someone who has This title if he gets up in the morning and says what am I going to do today to traffic data when  They find a good script, these data from advertising services do not only remain between advertising companies. Yes, they are also sold to companies, they are sold to governments and not, most of the time, we don't know. I don't know if someone tried to let us continue. Sorry.  in the area of ​​obertaxing services and the data that is not only collected but how it is sold and where it is kept and how it is stored there is no regulation there are no security standards there is no control yes and often no  there is encryption our study of mobile devices showed that in more or less three days which is how long our cvpn margin session lasts a mobile device contacts  ta more than 150 services and advertise indifferent yes So we are not only sending our unencrypted data to a server sometimes we are sending to many servers located in many different regions of the planet and as we know when there is good quality data taken in real time  abuse is always present and the problem with encrypted traffic because we know that if we are encrypting the traffic and we use tls And we have the green padlock, everything is encrypted It is not this and what is not Sometimes many of us have a conscience and  others it is not that the encrypted traffic tls the traffic the green padlock is not all encrypted I do not know if you were aware but the encrypted traffic is not all encrypted it is but but but we do not have the tls standard that supposedly encrypts everything I command and it is not  so in particular with the field that is called that night the server name indication is a field within the tls protocol which is where you man  They give the Host name, the place, the destination of the website that they are connecting to, this is for technical details, a certificate is needed that will later encrypt the connection and so on, but this information is fundamental. The mangrove cornerstone of many companies  telemetry and censorship security that use this data to know where you are going to find out who you are and to stop you, uses it from the Chinese and Russian governments in their Great firewall to stop how far you go to companies that need to protect you if you go somewhere a  Malware such as antivirus houses need to read that data and it is like it is here and we like that it is here because we need it and at the same time it is very bad that it is there because you are liquidating data So today you now have an encrypted protocol that if someone looks at the traffic  knows directly where they are going Ah you went to Google by dog ​​here MercadoLibre wherever it is yes it is a big problem in the industry a small Resort that we did a few years ago  For a time, it showed that the top 10 websites that you use that Nike were enough to separate people very quickly. The 10 places that you go to After three use your phone are different from yours from yours from yours from yours  of yours Up to a certain limit not clearly and it is sent like this to encrypt a lot we send all our dns to unencrypted and in particular multicas you have no one encrypts multiples and sends a lot of data And yes we have diot but if you know about uncle you know that he also gave watch which is  the encrypted dns uses tls in fact it is low tls but tls has scenario problems So when you use dio age You are also killing your Hotmail So maybe better say useful and some directly send http I don't know or have a problem encrypting And there is  many protocols of these personal custom that do something very intelligent that send data in a great way and leak a lot of data yes or make their own registration for example Like this  It is very important to know that even in encrypted data, particular data remains with the destination IP. Where are you going only with that data, the destination IP and using Pacific databases of the world that are free, it is very easy to know which domain you are  belonged to that IP although I only see your encrypted IP I see that you are entering OK cupid For example, what we found is that 9 out of ten devices analyzed in the last three years leak or filter the location of private data and personal identifiers And many other things that  of those that we show you yes 9 yes 9 out of 10 devices this is very very very very very high considering that we have had a registration for tens of years Yes no device that of those that of those that we analyze if you rub Its content none that means that everyone here  At this moment we are sending something that is unencrypted and that you can potentially use to track us and monitor us and the problem, as always, is the  awareness Yes so there is much much much more that we did not see and that cannot be put into the chat these are not all the applications that are left there thousands of applications many that the people that we investigated were not using and that are known to leak  and it was known before that they are sending data we have a lot of activities a lot of advertising a lot of companies there is a very big world that clearly its main problem is money and earning money and surviving and this is problem number 36,000 and it doesn't even have the resources O  They know how to start solving the problem, yes, we could clearly identify the applications because they were cleaning their name, we don't understand it, that is, we knew what those were because they say nothing, it's me, it's like, that's where the problem is so basic, sometimes things happen that we don't know well.  what and an application that supposedly had encrypt someone in the USA on their phone and it is not encrypting the country We do not know that sometimes  We can't check because it's not our phone, but how can it be cleaning if we know the application is now IKEA and well something happened someone did something we don't know what and was liquidating data Yes, this problem that we identified in the project that we identified is very important.  It's about the Phantom versions, the phantom versions, and if anyone is here developing applications for these companies, we would love to know why the application is being updated, there is an update and it was installed, but the version number did not change, it was you, how did it not change?  it may be a law 1.1.1 but as I brought now How do I know which one was before How do I know which one is before previous how do I share it What was the one that had the problem that they update every day do not convey responsibility no because as reported a problem of  a responsibility a security problem When the version is not the true one you are saying 11 But which one was there yesterday or the  What was the one that will be there next week because it has the same name? Yes, then the companies that reproduce the applications in some way I don't know how they manage to invisibly send patches or updates the change, so well, difficult to reproduce  Clearly for us it is a problem that we have because we want to install it but sometimes it is very difficult to do it. It is a problem that affects all brands and devices. I don't care what phone they have or what applications they have Unless they don't have a phone if the Nokia 1100  out there we do not check it for life I say now to check it but it affects all brands and devices a very important piece of information is good but if I have to elect someone as a government to monitor and follow it or look at all the data on the network  planning to follow it in the end is a question of cost it is not a question nor technique of decision the question that this is that if a government  wants to monitor using infections will monitor a few people from scenes 100 a no more than that and the first this the first step of the cheap is to develop your own spyware or download a spyware from somewhere in the world of gift modify it a little bit with each other  person or three people in your group you can do it very easily low quality usually from what we saw and heard the talk about spyware in latin america heard about this it is very cheap or as cheap as it can be to make your own spyware the next step  is to buy high-quality spyware, as in the case of pegasus, it is very, very expensive. Remember Verónica saying that a million dollars was paid for a pegasus for mansor and the other option is good to monitor without using infections, which is what we are analyzing in this  In any case, you can scale to thousands of people or they have already scaled to thousands of people and Well, there is a high cost of entry, which is not good, laws, democracies and things  like this The coup is expensive there is a lot of food for all sides but once you have control of the government and you have to buy the communications thatsits So the cost is like this that weight order everyone what happens Unfortunately the countries  that we see it and from there it is very very easy to keep track of many people and we wonder why phones are not more secure. Why? Why if we use them we carry it with us all the time we work from phones and the truth is  that access to the traffic of other applications and the operating system and knowing what happens is very difficult there is no behavioralization of identities we mix work personal life work is all one it is very difficult for us to control and you know this better than anyone what it is  what an application does I install Spotify I am using it and it works and does what it has to do and how do I know what is happening below there are no applications that  They show us advertise otherwise obviously we are not going to pay for all the apps but at the same time we pay for it because they sell our data but we can't control that when I eat it is very difficult to verify these applications it is very difficult to know before installing them what it is doing  What is the risk for me to be aware and the easiest and what we all fall into is good I install it I try it and see what's wrong and good and we take the risk But remember that there are people who cannot take that risk because their life  It depends on them, yes. So in certain governments it's very easy to watch you and follow you. You have to know, especially if you travel, it's very easy to do this. Many do it. Many don't tell you and maybe you don't know.  phone to carry two phones in certain countries and the reality is that civil society and society in general need hackers they need you now here they need people  Like you, who work in security, people who are interested in this, who have ideas, who are motivated, who have some time, need you to support this, because there are very few organizations and very few governments that are going to put time and effort into this, we don't know who is selling and buying.  the data is not clear there are no regulations at all We don't know where the data is going there is data that is known to have left the country We don't know how much data is being sent or not being sent we don't know how to even automatically detect this we still have to do  hand because very difficult task and there is almost no awareness in most people outside of computer security of everything that our phones send without encryption and remember everything that you send will be kept for many many many many years in all governments  that follow in many parts of the world yes the internet does not forget So it is up to us you are to help protect civil society if u  you value your freedom of expression as journalists or as citizens you need your help if you value your physical freedom you need your help now is the time where we have the time and effort in many countries to help in many others we no longer have the time to improve the situation  So today we wanted to say a big thank you to our colleague muhammad who for the last year has been working hard with us looking at thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of packages with us.  where to find us steven.org you can go there send us an email or check how to use our emergencycvpn service we have projects on github that you can also access from the web that are openers that can contribute and good Thank you very much thank you very much [Applause]
