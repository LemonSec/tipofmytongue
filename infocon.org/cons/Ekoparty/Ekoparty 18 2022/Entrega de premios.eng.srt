How are we another one to share more for many the first for other layers not so much what we think of the new place we like it we don't like it yes we don't come back yes no no problem Connect is cheaper if you want let's go No really good I'm going to do a  little time while people stop doing the main activity of this conference, which is the reunion, it seems little it seems like a joke it seems minor but if we could measure the number of arms that were given these three days this talk this conference would be measured with the only statistics  It's worth it with these criminals that I have here, we never thought they would let us rent this thing, we have to see if they renew us, but for now we're letting go of the idea of ​​a crazy party. For many, they already know it for others the first time they're going to hear it, and I  it seems that it is a story worth repeating eco Party is because there was nothing else sharing is what it is because it is an extension of us with its actions  The true and its errors the parallel activities the talks the beer the ping pong the table football the popcorn the shirt The shouting the megaphone are little things little Hot fixes that happened as we went on doing a conference But the reality is that we never wanted to do a conference  We always wanted to make a meeting point to meet other people that the same thing happened to us with what we were living learning and doing this year is the exception quite the opposite we understand that for the meeting we have to be more to be more  We have to be more empathetic, we have to teach more, we have to leave empty spaces for others to occupy, and I think that above all, and look at it, I am always the one who sends me the note. Come on, you can talk, I always try to say the same thing, the Echo  It is a stage a place for you in 2019 or 2018 I don't remember we already tried to do an eco party in another place in the United States with  and there was a question, no, what do you say, ok, dry party, if you're not there, perfect, applause, if what was planned, if we planned it, it didn't work out for us, that is shared, there is also no important improvisation, but that's it, and I think the adventure of doing it  free to do it in another place is the foot for what comes the first time we did in the Connect we didn't even have to hang the lights this year I think it's the same with another pole and nothing I'm a little excited because I met so many people again  from so many places people who have not seen four or five years ago and there is something that I think we have always talked about and someone who has come to the Eco in previous versions in the comics can attest that it is I greet all the people who  they entered from the welcome and normally when I told them the people who came to work at the Eco for the first time I explained to them Look at the Eco for us it's a birthday we're going to be busy we're going to this  running everywhere we are going to try that the world the people who came here have a good time with affection with closeness to the ear so that everything works to do coincidentally they celebrated my birthday for the first time in the Eco this one and I said Well it is the  damn But well we received a lot of love and I hope that if it is the first time or the fifteenth that you have come you have felt that love too everything is fine for sure everything is fine with the hacking but what makes this event special is that you are there who  share that they learn and today at this moment in this on this stage we are going to celebrate some milestones of this reunion so without further ado I am going to ask you for something to pass me the machete because we have the leonapsis people who are going to be delivering announcing winners come on [  Applause] And where do we have the chance, Mr. Ignacio is not good Mr. Ignacio is going to be here making announcements about what a good thing we had a cts this year if it was not very  and long there were not many challenges But there was variety Thanks to everyone who participated yes the idea is to tell you a little about how the delivery methodology is going to be we go up with the prizes just for you to see and drool nothing more but  We are not going to hand them over now, it's more if I knew that he went on stage I was combing my hair before But well, not that, and well And apart from a comment for one of those who are on the podium, if I have them, I just ticketed them, the first one was funny Yes  with that name let's say team pug the second and Phoenix the third those are the order of the awards yes congratulations to them [Applause] just to clarify let's say that the people of Phoenix have posted an email that is incomprehensible actually it is not an existing email please  we ask you to update it to receive the prize Yes because the method is going to be to contact us via email to validate let's say they are really the account owners So actu  Alizo normally possible otherwise the third place will be for the rooms that is cusquito that has a real mail Yes so good just that Thank you very much to all and especially to you Ah Well there goes the prize So correct the mail because if not  I was lucky, we are going to invite the New Life Team, who have been the organizers of the Eco Party CTF for many years, everything is live, don't come, come on, some geniuses, the truth is, it's a huge job to organize the Eco's stf.

Today it is the pirate ship that navigates the networks of Buenos Aires and  that works not only as a meeting point workshop but also as an albaysori that they do not use the web or open networks But hey, we are going to launch a map It seems to me that we already have enough Data to make an interesting map or have we been allowing the map for a while  time a map several times we go we go the map comes the map So yes Good but Sorry to interrupt you this Beyond War driving awards this is for them part  Especially not for the organizers Agustín Tomás I don't know if they are still going around there they are not but well I want to tell you that for the first time there were more than 100 people two days in a row who got on the bus So a big round of applause for them is  It's super important, it's a super fun activity, it's characteristic of the Eco, whatever you can get on, you can go for a walk around the city, go hacking, you can't say that word on stage, it's not going to scan networks, test a couple of systems, but it's highly recommended to everyone.
