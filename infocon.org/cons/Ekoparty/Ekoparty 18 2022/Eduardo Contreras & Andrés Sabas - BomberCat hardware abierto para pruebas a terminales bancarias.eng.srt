We welcome Eduardo Contreras and Andrés Abastos with loud applause [Music] [Music] they announced My name is Andrés abas he is Eduar Contreras the partner and today we are going to talk about bomber Cat Open hardware for testing bank terminals we introduce ourselves  first a little about us I am Andrés abas I am an electronics engineer by the technician from Mexico I am also a co-founder of electronics I am currently the engineering leader also a hacker space for a long time that was called inventorhouse Free Hardware for approximately 10-8 years I  They liked something like curious and I really like board games traveling to eat So if we take a drink here we can go eat something delicious I introduce myself I am also a graduate of the electronics engineering degree in Mexico from the technology of Mexico co-founder of  electrónicats together with Andrés abadz and two other RF amateur partners all the RF part they can see  er of the products I had something to do and well, I'm a fan of craft beer and board games. Likewise, if someone wants to share a beer with great pleasure and Well, we'll talk a little about Tommy cats, we started it in 2017 electronics is a Mexican electronics company  created specifically for Open Hardware we mainly developed electronic cards in areas of Education security we like security a bit and we started to create the same we made some alliances you will see it later with with hackers with friends of us who like this part of Hardware and we started  to create cards to develop amateur makers but we also help companies in solutions in the consulting part for the Hardware part and this presentation It is a bit of a story that led us to create bomberca won the part of how we started to create introducing ourselves  in the part of the payment methods a bit of why we are in this part of what  s payment methods is because from 2004 Eh Well the truth is that the nfc part has been established there has already been a great part because the part of payments that is, I have gotten bigger and bigger and it is considered that it will continue to increase in  how much from the use of nfc magnetic stripe and all those technologies, well, every day we have them with us, the bank terminals, we are going to see here how they also need to be enabled and even for the development part. How good we are going to see it with Wally's example  to be testing these terminals in these areas Hardware tools a little about so that we have all the concepts we are going to be talking about magnetic stripe the magnetic stripe of the cards that we all use both in banks and accesses for hotels for the bus or others even some  theaters have it is this band that sits at the bottom of their cards and internally you're going to see it Well internally it really has  e small points of magnet You could say magnets That at the moment of being read by the reader The reader of a terminal or a card of one of an ATM well these ones and zeros will simply appear this part really mentioned it did something  mentioned as maxbox And these days it has a standard for a long time Although this type of technology has stopped being used, we really continue to see it, it has not really stopped being used Although it is going to be replaced by nfc, something very important to note about the magnetic stripe here  It is that the information is static, perhaps it sounds quite logical because they do not change our card often. But this is a key factor that will help us understand the concept of payments a little more and how the part that is static has evolved, since it is a  vulnerability as it is, but in order to defend this static part, they created different codings and different standards, such as the isos that are being released  located here where each one has a different protocol to be able to access bank information, not then here This is a very important part, which is where all the first technology used to make payments by means of a card starts from here, not even  It has not ceased to be used and an example of this is smst that was recently acquired by Samsung and that in itself What it is not, it could be done or you could think that it is nfc because it is close to your cell phone and you make a payment but really what it is doing  here Samsung is emulating a magnetic stripe this is like an update of this type of payment Because here that magnetic stripe is constantly changing as a token but the disadvantage is that it is still a magnetic stripe not to be confused with nfc it is a different technology it is simply  emulating a magnetic stripe card good based on all the above mentioned about the mst Sami Card exposes a vulnerability about good just with  a device called the maxbook publishes a Hardware based on an at&t and an l293 in a motor driver with a fairly simple coil, simply with a button, it begins to make the evolution of the magnetic stripe no So from our point of view it was a hardware  not easy to do you had to buy a perforated card to get the components and solder them and we thought that the l293 was a little functional Driver for the times we live in and quite expensive So from electronics we did start an initiative to create open Hardware for the security approach  where we began to try to make small improvements, add a slightly more formal presentation towards the Hardware and here you can see on your left a macbook version 1 that we generated where you can put your at Tiny is the same processor has its programming port and also comes with  a Driver for the coil much more much more robust and much smaller robust in terms of the  electronic part the electrical part of how it works and also a specific place to solder the coil when we started this design we thought of it as a Do it yourself kit because since the first matchbook that Sami put out there was this philosophy of doing it yourself not here it is  where we learn or realize that many people dedicated to computer security are not so deep in, they are not so interested in soldering and other things there are few who are not and here we began to sell more than anything the fully assembled kit This began to give us a  better understanding of the public, no, and well, it was so much so that one of our friends Salvador Mendoza did a little while ago in defcon about precisely the type of payment from Samsung where he took the tokens generated by Samsung and then inserted them into the tokens  happen with a matchbook really what he does is take that token that never expires despite if you don't renew it is one of the fa  llas that he found and also makes a type of Relay this Well, at some point Salvador contacted us because we have a version of maxbox the version of maxmo that you see there if you realize it is smaller you can put a battery and we begin to realize that  We can help other people who are experimenting with this type of card and Maxwell was the first one taken from an already open circuit and we have come to improve it. They realize that the payment is with Samsung and later I already know it with MacBook  A vending machine has already been bought, I read the coke with a Samsung token, well, from here, from electronics, we continue to develop products and, well, different applications with different processors, from here comes the idea of ​​generating a new version of the MacBook, at the most because it is a  An open design, someone, I don't know where, had generated a version 2, we decided to respect its coming, its version 2, and we released version 3, the version  on 3 comes with a much more powerful processor than an at&t with a usb connection capable of reprogramming via arduino in a very simple way it also has more ram more flash memory you could already store enough cards not just three or four tracks or lines of max drive  and it has a much smaller size and in this case you no longer have to create your coil the coil is already included it comes with a protection and comes with a battery charger so if you want too Suddenly a lipo battery a cafeteria León go ahead and you can  take you from your portable device so that's how we found version 3, which is the last version we released from the Max, moving on to the part about knowing that payments have been evolving and the magnetic stripe is no longer being used, so we started working on projects  that they are using new payment technologies and there is the nfc inside the nfc and the part of the mv that is also the part of the chip is in the pelu  which is the protocol in which the terminals or points of sale communicate together with the cards themselves in broad strokes It is a protocol that is already established it has an ISO and within each transaction there are these attachments these attachments give access to certain parties  of the card as a file system in broad strokes and it is used both in chip and in nfc this mainly what comes to change compared to the magnetic stripe is that these data do change and are not static and Well a little earlier about nfc  For those who do not know the technology, it is a wireless technology that you will find it above all, for example, in cards, for example, of the metro, in buses, to access certain places and, mainly, it can be confused with the rfid that the rfid is a similar technology but that  mainly it has greater distances one of the advantages disadvantages of nfc is that you have to be very close to be able to read those are some axes  Examples of cards, for example, there is a Latino delivery in Mexico, bank cards, example tags where you can make payments, changes in transactions within the same nfc, there are active ones. Well, there are mainly passive ones. And that depends, they are internally powered by the card reader, so yes  they realize they are in the bank cards and Well, there we begin with this adventure It is also important to mention that either rfid or nfc all part of the same principle that it is an rf that can be identified So not because it says rfid it will necessarily be at Low frequency  or high frequency is a fairly common error But well in the end they are somewhat similar technologies each one may have other protocols it may have less protocols but hey in this case we are categorizing to make it easier to talk about the entire part of rfid on 12  megahertz As nfc here I am going to talk a little about the nfc copycat That we practically realized  I find that the information security community used a chip called png 532 a lot, which was used to read nfc. So we decided to generate a carrier board, a master board that can control this VPN 532 module with the nfc, the NFL comes from here  energ5 pickup which allows you to program by micropison or circuit or with c any nfc functionality so here we also put a microcontroller of the addam family of 21 quite common with the arduino family quite common with families of other developer brands and also  uh, we integrated a flash memory to be able to have much more goofy programs, no, this was one of the first devices compatible with Circuit python focused on computer security and it also already gave you possibilities to reprogram the device simply by dragging and dropping this device right  now we no longer sell it due to the inclusion of the Cat bomber in e  The mfc copycat that we added at the same time we also added no So we had Max nfc and and a controller that could be reprogrammed with Circuit python in a simple way something interesting in this device is that together with Salvador Mendoza we made a dangram of an nfc card a net nfc card  it has some data similar to a magnetic stripe card so you can read that magnetic stripe card Selene security and pass it off as a magnetic stripe card as it is then from nfc to magnetic stripe And this is something that allows you this  Good device, this part is quite interesting because it all starts from the beginning of the stories that we saw before, since they are compatible, you could take the Track number that comes inside the nfc card and modify something within the protocol so that the terminal detects that it is simply  a device your card is a device that does not have nfc or a chip so anything else can happen  go magnetic And you can also uninhibit the pin Or you can choose other types of technologies no So it becomes an interesting vulnerability due to the emulation part it was something we wanted to achieve but with pn532 it could not be carried out correctly so we decided to create  the nfc undercut which also integrates a m0 cortex as we saw in the nfc but here we integrated a new reader a pn7150 a series of nxp quite interesting where we could do good to have the ability to emulate reading all the protocols that are listed here in the image no Y  As you can see, we can emulate card reading and writing cards as well as communication to transmit information, that is, you can leave a Hunter somewhere to obtain information and then with another Hunter Cup to obtain that information or simply in the same Hunter Cat  no then This is a product that is still for sale and for example here we have a  quite fast video where the huntercard detects when there is a reader reading data for example in this case the reader is on but it is not reading any data and I do not detect anything as soon as the reading of the reader is activated the Hunter Cat will tell you someone is taking out  information from me what do you really want to know when you generate an nfc transaction there is only one session and there can only be byte exchange through that session So when you want to know that there is a reader Well when it is really active and when it is  looking for something to get from your card not everything all of How can you get something because it comes from the part of the apdos that we saw ok this is something that we did with control every hour for ecoparing in our airbnb the access was nfc and the countercad  It allows you to emulate an nfc card simply with the ID, that is, the badges only need the nfc ID, it does not ask you for any other information, so we simply clone  that ID and we made it emulate the FC counterchain to be able to open the lock or the door of our airbnb and I mean for this specific lock it was an Audi with a 4-byte ID so making a Brute Force attack is not very difficult either, no  we thought about it but they didn't do it and well as a result of all this we started to get good, we started to have clients, especially one came that we are going to present, Wally who, when he saw our technology, saw it not only as a tool for auditing but also as a  I developed a problem that they have or that they had was the part of multiplying cards when developing terminals they are dedicated to the development of some bank terminals they have to test with many cards and each of their developers has to have that number of cards then  it became something really expensive to have so many cards for one developers and what they need is something they were Something similar to this  To give an idea of ​​what it is to be able to have a rack of cards and be able to pass them through each terminal, this is really just chip reading. But what they needed was to be able to do nfc and to be able to do magnetic stripe, so they saw the nfc copy, which were the products that  We saw previously And they told us Hey, I think it could be something interesting here as a result of that, well, Bomber Cat was born. We generated the bomb with an architecture very similar to all the other devices where we have a main chip that is compatible with Circuitton. We have an NFC  pn7150 that is already handled from the Hunter knfc but apart from that we add something that the Hunter ktmfc does not have, the matchbook does not have all the magnetic stripe emulation part. So if you want to get information from nfc as I mentioned, you knew recently how  did in the nss nfc you take information out of nfc and then downgrade and emulate in the magstripe here you can do exactly what  same but apart from that you can also emulate the part of the Band The nfc no So you can obtain the nfc data and we will start this technology something very important here that gave the board a lot of versatility is that we added the WiFi connectivity part and  Bluetooth then with food WiFi connectivity really allows us to create a world of possibilities where we can already be injecting packets directly to macbook and exposing different cards we can already be taking information from different nfc cards at the same time with some hotspot etc. no  So with the same cell phone with bluetooth here you can see the Bomber Cat is a fairly small device this was an edition that we released for Defton it is a Pink edition just the ones that we are bringing here Argentina and that we are selling on our website They are  dark but this was the first version we released, not what you can see below  It is the nfc antenna, it is external and also what we can see on the right is the coil to do all the magnetic stripe emulation part. The antenna gives you a range of 10 to 15 centimeters, very dependent on your entire environment, but practically for that reason.  it is flexible and let's say with its long cable to be able to generate more connections a simple application that you can do with or for what we have thought of as a bomber every time for example there is this example that is You have your macbook your terminal the cat bomber and you want to be  You test both magnetic demand and nfc, you simply connect the bomber cat to your computer via USB and through a python script or some other language because the bomber cat has certain commands that it will receive to either put itself in magnetic stripe mode or in nfc  You will be able to insert either by injecting the magnetic stripe tracks or by asking it to read certain cards or furniture, certain nfc cards, this can be completely  automate and that is why it has taken this part of its positive you cannot automate certain commands and be replicating so you are generating a new update for the terminal you need to try it with a mastercard with a Visa Or others and execute the entire cycle of  tests in which you load the firmware you run the test with mastercard and you check or with the cards you check whether it happens or not If your software is working or not another quite interesting application is where you have a test center that is not centralized let's say centralized to  level I am working at home not at the post level because it is something physical it has to be centralized but let's say that you want to do certain tests from home you connect your bomber Cat your final device that is linked to or is physically connected to or near the terminal  tests and then from any other point you will be generating commands and the same programming In the same way that  it was done through USB this can be extrapolated in many ways, but in the end you have a device that you can control externally which you can leave hidden somewhere to be able to do some kind of test and the most interesting I think and the  What we like the most Even the first proof of concept that we did on the Cat bomber was with this architecture where you have a local WiFi network or it can be through the internet you have an MTV broker and on one side you have a card with nfc and a  Cat bomber client that is doing the reading that is connected to a Host on this side that is next to the terminal so the card on our right is doing the emulation of any other nfc card and the one on the left will be doing the reading  So when you start a transaction the first few commands to pdu arrive to our emulated card and the emulated card transmits those commands to pdu to see how.  mo responds to the other card here is a video already with the demonstration of operation it is a Replay attack there you can see a Mercado pago terminal and well those are some that you say 3D that we made for them it really is not a big deal they are public the same good print from  That side is the client and it explains the whole part of how the apdu commands are being sent and received. There it is doing the emulation and seeing the commands and finishing a bit is not as fast as with the card because there is a certain delay but that is also  Another interesting part where there is a strong Gap and certain times that allow us to do remote attacks, not something very important for us, has always been open source. We have learned a lot about Open source platforms and we believe a lot in the part of  share technology and share software and well this is no exception No here we have bomber Cat it's made in an opener program called kickass it's a t  quite simple two-layer card and anyone who wanted to learn about how to use for example the processor that we use an rp 2040 that comes in the raspberry pico or others or the pn7150 And how to make the part of the antenna connection or the part of the macbook  Well, we invite you to review our repositories and then you can see how it works, see how the guts are and also Search for the examples here we already have some examples, you can search for them in github as well as in bomber Cat and then you will find as Eduardo says from the  quematic but also some examples already of the firmware These are some examples that we have already developed in which you can do detection of nfc cards make a macbook mqtt in which you can send commands or good magnetic stripe via mqtt to the device we have the relay that is the client  and the Host that the same we are still updating new things in that part is a device that works as  client that does the emulation and a device that reads the card and sends it, we have the Maxwell part and well, some other things we want to do is the Point-to-Point communication part between bomber cats without having to go through a server but simply  through the same WiFi network where a device works as a server internally does the reading and there is no intermediary we are missing the bluetooth part also the one that you can have a Bluetooth application that can be receiving the information or also sends information to the device some  examples in Circuit python because we also want it to be a language in which programmers can also feel more comfortable when it comes to generating firmware and well, we also have one that actually already exists, it is also the one we call it Attack, which is  take from a csv file a series of list of cards or magnetic stripe and it will go testing one by one simply  Before you modify that file or edit it and they will be doing a test attack with different cards, then you don't even have to have or be sending this data via mqtt or via WiFi, but rather if you have a series of cards that you want to test, validate if they work  you add this file And he is going to do them each one And well, we also want to thank Wally because this company has helped us in terms of accessing a bank terminal as it will be in its test center, it can be said in its version of  tests to be able to carry out a series of transactions without being banned or blocked and also that the Wally company approached us, for example, and we told them about the possibility of doing Open sours throughout this project and well they are open and well that was the agreement not then  Well, we are very pleased and we are quite grateful that apart from the internal scope at the company level that this project has, we are  We are now able to bring this project to the market also thank you Salvador Mendoza and who helped us a lot with his book Show me the money is a book in Spanish completely dedicated to the part of digital payment systems nfc rfid chips So if anyone is interested in  This part of technology is an excellent book in Spanish that we highly recommend and also good Salvador was waiting for us about this part to be able to make the payments to be able to do the example of Relay so thank El Salvador for the tips it is also very important to highlight here the  part of the bus ap no each each Command each each part can be very specific to a bank or a type of card so right in the book it gives you a path that is a little easier than what you can find on the Internet no then  Well, just thank you, we can skip some questions and we also bring a bomb to give away and a Hunter to give away E  So we are going to ask some questions at the end, two questions to see who gets them, but if you have some questions for us first, we will gladly answer them. It would be a matter of seeing if the card you are trying to emulate is already inside the 750 penis because we  What we did, the 7150, is the improvement or evolution of the 532. So it already brings new ones, they support new devices. It would be a matter of seeing if it is already there, you will have to see the data sheet as it is, very surely.  with obsolete and there is a new version even the technology is completely evolving But yes rather and you will have to get the data sheet and see if specifically the card you want to emulate is already supported by the penis 7150 works by means of nci commands So if you have  a functionality with a certain specific name, you could go to the reference manual of the chip as it is and check if in those c  omandos comes specifically what you need I say right now it's a bit difficult to walk but I'm almost sure that it can be covered due to the amount of technology it brings and because the 532 penis is more limited but it depends so well yes I didn't want to ask you if it has  some limit on the issue of the amount of Data that I can make modular for the matchbook because I found that in tests that I tried to do Brute Force to do to make plugins on the reader I found that something always burns medium so I wanted  To know more or less what limitations I have directly, I can send you the quantity. Well, firstly, the limitation at the physical level for us in the coil, we have found that we can be making multiple transmissions and absolutely nothing happens to our device at the security level of each terminal, it can vary. So  at least in the tests that we have done around a transmission I say each  at 500 milliseconds a second and the terminal continues to respond because it's like you already know something more human and in terms of track capacity that you can have Well, it's rather the memory, for example in Bomber Cat Well, if you have 2 megabytes of memory and that's what it's for  Since you have to have hundreds of tracks rather instantly, as they say, it's the time you sent it to the terminal and it reaches them for processing and One last question I know that in the matchbook there is a Trick to be able to emulate El trago an interest  to pass 32 in reverse that, technically with some firmware fixes, can be fixed in the readers to only read one address, it opened some way to bypass that problem once that fix is ​​implemented, there would be no going back, let me explain. You don't want that now, or in  the terminal part on the side is the terminal if it fixes the problem exactly both heads had two different tracks If you run Track 1 and Track 2 in reverse such that  The tracks by checking the firmware of the reader could be forced to read only one direction in both cases. So you couldn't hide the traitor because you only have one coil that would kill the evolution of trek 2 on the macbook no no because in the end you can with if it reads  Track one or if it reads Track 2 anyway, it will be the transaction, both are not always read, that is, it can really be one or the other and it will be trying to make the transaction. It does not necessarily need both of course, thanks, no.  I also know, does anyone have any questions around here, no? Well, we are going to give away a contracad, which is another of our products over here, which is a very simple skimmer detector and a pump, which is the product we are talking about, so you don't want to make one yourself.  question that Salvador does not Well then let's go to the first question would be what application So that they give us an application that they gave to the bomberker that they can think of right now that is not d  and the ones that we show, that is, you have a Bomber Cat, what can you think of right now to say Ah look, I could use in this over there I don't know here first from the back I think that if you can repeat it with the microphone I would like to analyze all the security of the cards  university that I understand that they are, that is, they can, for example, in a good implementation, receive messages, encrypt them and return them, it will be another issue like Chanel's response, but I have also seen that in other places it simply reads the first four bytes, like what you said about the  side of your from your airbnb so I would like to take a look at that at least within the university where I am since you are a university student we are going to support you

827
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,500
so that you can start come on

828
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,200
and the last one is What is the name of the

829
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,060
protocol that is used to

830
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,180
communicate  with mb and nfc that I already

831
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,160
mentioned here

832
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,940
mv and nfc remember

833
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,400
so here is one

834
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,980
Okay well we are all you can

835
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,800
find them in the riptime area at  cá

836
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,700
in the classroom c the room c the same Well if

837
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,079
you want to talk or something Thank you very much

838
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,619
everyone thank you
