well We welcome Frieza with a loud applause [Applause] good people how are you going I hope you come enjoying the Echo my first chamoneco So I'm a little a little nervous you can see the slimes no good I'll start the talk now we'll get into the topic  so no we don't waste time this talk is called doing croatia with space satellites because basically I'm going to show you things that are pretty crazy by the standards of operating space satellites I'm Juan Pedro Fifanotti But everyone tells me at Pizza So if I  They say Juan, I'm not going to turn around and I currently work in satellites, I did a lot of things about artificial intelligence, software development in general, and so on, but right now I'm working in this company that makes space satellites. We design them, we manufacture them, we launch them and then they  we use squares at the image service and I am in the part that we write the Software that controls the ates  software on the ground and in space that decides what each satellite is doing at any given time. So the idea is to show you a little bit about how we broke or used them in ways that people didn't expect or at least weren't designed to use them in  That way, nothing without permission, I mean, all the things we did were always with permission because we had to do it for Laura, but it's still hacking in the more general sense of taking something that was designed to work in one way and using it in a very different way.  I know I'm going to show you some examples of that and then it takes a little bit of What are the things that made it easier for us to use them before in such crazy ways to have a little bit of context so the company that makes these ates is satelogic the idea like this  long-term satellite analysis, which is to have a fleet that is remapping the entire Earth in high resolution every hour, we don't have such a large fleet yet, but we're going  We are growing little by little and we already have thirty-something satellites launched into orbit and today we provide image services, that is, if you want a photo of some place, hire a photo, and one interesting thing is that we do not welcome the service, but rather the  At these times, we design and build them ourselves, we operate them and we know them very well because they are sats designed by us. Well, what is operating sats to put a little base so that we more or less understand what we are going to break later or use it differently?  basically if you have a disaster what you want to do for the purposes of the types that we use that are earth observation we want to do two things capture photos and download photos yes if we could what we would like is to have a camera floating in space that takes photos  when we ask him, pointing out the place where we ask and magically the photos appear here on the ground, that cannot be done because it is magic, so what he does  Emos It's good, you have to put a computer in the back to control the camera, you have to put solar panels so that it has power, you have to put disks to save the photos, you have to put antennas to transmit it when it passes by somewhere and then a lot of things start to be added  extras that one has to do to achieve the final objective, which was to be able to take the photo and have it here on land. An important detail is that the connection with the ates is sporadic, they are not connected all the time, they are not online all the time when they have a connection.  It has a very good connection but they only have a connection when they pass over the antennas, there are earth stations in places on earth where there are antennas that point the satellite at it, so also the tip of the antenna and at that moment you have a connection and there you have to do everything  that you need communication with the satte until you upload all the new instructions that you think the next ones will do  orbits and so on and download all the Data that has generated the photos mainly and then also telemetry and things that you use to operate So satin is you can think of it as a server that is running Jobs that is running tasks things that you want it to do and that  It has sporadic connections, so when you're not connected or you're thinking about what you think you should do, when you finally have a connection, you upload the plan, we tell it that it's the sequence of instructions that you think it should execute, and then in the next pass, perhaps you don't upload it.  nothing because if not I didn't follow through with the plan you had or maybe things changed and you built a new plan and uploaded a new plan with instructions Yes then all the crazy things that I'm going to show now are designed and worked more than anything in  land, that is, on land, we decided to upload a sequence of instructions that does something crazy that was not what it was designed for, but the main  ipal work let's say to be able to do those crazy things is to change how we are planning these sequences of instructions and so on and many times that is not enough many times we need to add features rise up to be able to do crazy things And then the teams of people who  write software of the system that points the satellite or the system that turns on the devices or things like that then sometimes it also requires futures on the other side and on the ground What is the objective that one tries to pursue basically optimize the use of that fleet Yes  so all these crazy things are generally oriented to that side, which is that we want to get the most out of the satellites we have in orbit, yes we want to take as many photos and square kilometers and more as we can to sell more because it's a  company So the plan was on Earth, you have to be watching all those satellites that we have that are resources and everything  s the requests that you have on the other side, which are the targets that people want to take out as you distribute and How to put together an instruction sequence for each sate of all that fleet so that you maximize the strike of the output of that of that fleet, true that I have  well, some details of how to take photos that are not minor, the ates orbit very fast, they are advancing about 28,000 kilometers 27,000 kilometers per hour more or less if they are low orbits they are more or less 400 and something kilometers high at that altitude to keep you  in orbit That is the speed you have to have is similar, for example, to the height of the space station we are just a little bit higher, and also the cone of vision of the camera is very small. Do think that, for example, our high-resolution photos are  of 5 by 5 km So, at a distance of 400 kilometers, a small square below 5 by 5 is a very finite cone Yes, very very very finite, that is, the field of vision of the SAT is very very  narrow And that means that any error in the angle doesn't hit it, even by chance, what you wanted to hit, that is, I live in Rafaela I wanted to take a photo of Rafael in the center in the Plaza de Rafael to Rafaela 5 by 5 km almost the entire  city, well, half of the city, if you say, I'll give it three degrees, the photo is capable of 200 kilometers to one side, that is, Rafael Any is in the photo, so the precision with which you have to work these angles is very, very, very fine  and to aim the jump it can only rotate, that is, I don't know if How many will know about space, but once you put things in an orbit, it is very difficult to change the orbit, that is, change the inclination, put an orbit that passes through another side, but  yes, what you can do very easily is change where you are looking, that is, it is like being in a car, the car goes by yourself, you cannot drive it, but you can change where you are looking, if the Jump can basically do that. So the p  The problem in the photo is basically in a car that I am driving at 28,000 kilometers per hour, I want to aim at a Target that is 500 kilometers away with a cone of vision of 0.2 degrees and at the moment that it passes because since I am moving so fast  if it is known constant before an instant later what I see is something else yes And where is it being smaller than the photos are actually videos yes video and photo in our world is half of the same thing because what is one that is a video is one  sequence of photos yes a chain of photos that one posts showing them every 0.5 seconds and then has the illusion of movement our ates are also taking photos like this one after the other just that we don't compose them in a video normally sometimes yes  but most of the time no, rather what we often do is take many photos of an entire region and then put if you have a strip that covers a large region, things like that, but  It's the same in software, that is, the camera software at that moment is taking a lot of frames and it has to keep taking a lot of frames. So if you later want to convert them into an animation, then you want to convert them into a long strip of terrain, it's a problem of how to process land  These images How are they taken So, because of what he was just saying, sometimes we make it a video, sometimes we do it by having an image strip and so on, that is quite defined by what maneuver you are doing with the satellite, if these are the ones I am going to show  the two normal ways to take photos for later then Show that it's not normal what's crazier a very normal way to take photos is to take a Spotlight is to point at a point on the ground get up you keep advancing 28,000 kilometers per hour but that's you going  turning to continue aiming at that same point on earth yes So with that you have For example if you wanted the Eiffel Tower see with all the  cars moving around and what do I know you have a lot of frames of the Eiffel Tower But hey, one detail that the angle will change you because the capable satellite that starts looking at you in front and ends up seeing you from behind or something like that, so that's useful when  you want to have a lot of information about a particular point the other type of capture is what we do a lot more for example the satellite which is the stripe the stripe is basically they did not target a single point but rather the other way around trying to maintain a relatively constant angle  and you are taking frames But then what you are looking at on earth changes if that fuchsia thing down there is what you are seeing at all times and then now from all that sequence of images later you can reconstruct it and have a piece  length of land So you remember what it said the photo is 5 by 5 kilometers Well now it's not 5 by 5 now you can take a 5 by n photo until  where I give you the camera or as far as you can see land or any of those limits I don't know if there is a question here it brings to you how it ends up being a case with overlapping or focused more for it to the end because that takes a while to answer me  I was wondering if there is an overlap, you don't enter the images, the short answer is that there is an overlap because we need to reconstruct the color later if you want, if we finally see the detail in time, that's it, but well, the question then of the stripes, I'm constantly taking photos maintaining the angle of the satellite more  or less constant So I am seeing different pieces of the earth this is much more useful for when you want to cover large areas Yes yes for example someone comes to us says Che I want you to take a picture of all of Buenos Aires every 5 by 5 km then  I can't do it with a single frame, nor will I be able to do it in a single pass because in one pass I'm going to do a 5 kilometer strip  rivers of good width with n passes and in the satellites I will make n strips that later we can recompose all those strips and have a complete photo of Buenos Aires, a not minor detail is that the earth is curved, not when there are times when you cross there some  person who has some kind of strange ideas that the earth is not curved I would love it if the earth is not curved that is, it would be much much easier miraculous and the earth was a flat thing as it is not flat Unfortunately this implies that you throw those  For example, they are actually curves on the surface, it also implies that the orbit In general, it is not enough for you to maintain a constant angle, you have to do something a little different to follow a strip with the same frame rate on the ground, it implies things such as  If you want to take a large area and cut it into strips, say Ah, you cut it into strips 5 kilometers wide and that's it, and each one of those is a strike that you can do. Don't imagine.  I know that if I put two cars on the equator and I tell them both start going north that they pass the North Pole they collide on earth there are no parallel lines I can't make two parallel lines So I can't grab an area and tell it what  I do it in strips of 5 kilometers parallel to each other, not because they all intersect. So that complicates a lot of questions about How to take photos from space. There is another talk that will be giving a conference that is like Wednesday, we do.  Because there are already a lot of band-aids and with very, very large areas, well, it's a whole world to try to do that, but until now, we have two types of photos: Spotlight and strike. And that's the normal way to take photos of space, but I  I promised I was going to talk about crazy stuff not normal stuff So let's get into how we hack into asates to do weird stuff when we've been asked to do weird stuff for some reason.  Some reason What are the acrobatics that we have done with them With them back nothing to break without permission These are always within the company we have to do something to them the answer you are almost always crazy and the answer Well yes but we have to do it the same  and well how we do it the first one is literally an acrobatics that is the ram turn that this is something that we no longer do today but that basically solved this problem it was in the early days where many of the systems were still being developed and more today in  day Now things are much more stable there were some stability issues Yes, since the photo they remember the [ __ ] that super finite keep it pointing at the target it is not a paid booger it is not it is not easy at all and there were some issues with which it moved and  It wasn't really stable, but there he realized that if the SAT was turning at a certain speed, it's a much more stable time, since it achieved more stability, they were being  It was rotating as we solved then to make all the photos stable, take all the photos rotating so for a while our photo would always do a roundabout before taking the photo, that is, if I wanted to take Rafaela who is up ahead and I come this way  a while before he already began to accelerate and he did a lap he began to spin and the lap was finished just so that when he passed by Rafaela he would do like this and see Rafaela and keep turning Yes that lap was his time let's say his life time where all the  We do the photos that we take with this so that they come out well, well targeted Until obviously the people who developed the targeting system achieved a much better targeting system and today we no longer need it but another one that is a little rarer one day we have a client and we  He says that he wanted to take a picture of something but that something was not a piece of land that something was the space station I mean the international space station  ional that I was telling you before we are a bit higher up Well I wanted to take a photo of the space station Why and because it is a client that really does that for work, that is, it is a company called Geo robotics that provides service if you  You have something in space and you want to have more detailed information. In what state is it? They get you a photo and they analyze it. For example, your satellite is not turning on and you don't have communication and perhaps the solar panels weren't deployed. Well, they can help you.  a photo where you can see if you have the solar panels deployed or not now they don't have satellites what they do is go to the companies that have satellites and ask for the photo because then they fell on us saying I need a photo and the first one is late  We're going to give you a try, I want you to take me to the space station, that one has a few challenges on the one hand, I told him, get up, it's moving.  18,000 miles an hour the space station too yeah So it's no longer in the car going super fast point something at it that's standing still now it's in the car going super fast point it at a thing that's going super fast in a completely different direction Yeah then they start to  appear things like How long are you going to see it keep aiming the release at the space station impossible why Because the speed that you would have to turn when it crosses you well below impossible to achieve with our ates with almost any So it was the solution let's say it was good  We're not going to, we're not going to follow him to the space station, we're going to take a picture at a time when we're sure that the space station is going to be crossing down there. Yes, well, it has to have perfect Ultra timing.  frames per second and the space station we will see it hopefully in a frame if it was perfectly finished if it is not  finished Even in the time between frames I could pass the entire space station and get out of the field of vision and not see it later another problem was Well if the station comes out we were lucky it stays in the frame imagine what a photo of someone moving at 28,000 kilometers is like  now it will not come out still the photo is going to come out moved again obviously we had to elaborate a little there in how much exposure time we put on it and the whole camera to make it as little moved as possible I know that it does not come out lubricated it was going to come out in this  I had to elaborate a lot and precisely the first half was very hashish all this was good let's grab the tools we have we have a satellite that can take pictures of the floor we want to take the space station well the space station No it will not be part of the photo in  Yes, that is, we are going to calculate the photo to the ground, we are going to take a photo at this point on the ground so that when I am taking the frames and it is  all well timed just the space station makes a photobon in the middle and appears in front of the floor then a completely different way of using the satellite from how it was planned it was planned to take things out of it on the ground you want to take something spacey well we didn't take the ground out of it  and just crossed a spatial Target in the middle it ended up as a product, that is, after the hacks and we all said good now we are going to develop Seriously and it became productive as well as walking and today this client is using it a lot and I show you one like this  more as illustrative a little of the results of that This is, for example, a crossing that we have taken from the station to those two little dots that are moving slowly, our ates are the one that is in the most vertical line, the space station is the one in the  steeper line and note that it seems to be moving slowly but if you think about it, how many kilometers are you traveling? That is very fast and the result of that photo  Or in particular, this is what you see here, he is clearly making a facial. In other words, if you saw photos of the space station moving very fast, this is how you can see something of the panels, these giant solar panels that they have, and here you can see that the  body that has some big custom thing also in the middle and other following problem of This was how to process that photo in reality There is a problem before still that is How do I know if the station was in the photo Well the first hacks were take out pixel difference  Between the images and look when you see a very big difference, all the images will have something different because it is always moving and the whole ball, but when you see a lot of big DIF, send an alert for a human to look to see if that frame that changed a lot with previous ones  the one with the station at the end the client preferred to do the processing on their side So we give them the always raw images and they do detection and  others But I would love to be able to show it because they shared it with me This is what the client gets from that photo that we took moved that they take and turn it into this why and because the blur is linear it is in only one direction because  it's crossing so fast that it's basically moving in one direction so you can with math that I don't know do a little bit of processing and have what should have been below for the blues to look that way with the line moving in the front direction  and one extra thing that I had to add yesterday to this this very thing this same client has been asking us for a few photos lately I don't know if they found out that a chunk of Chinese discount is about to fall, they have a question about when the rockets are launched  some large parts are left orbiting right now so they end up falling without control but they can fall anywhere on the planet for sure it will  to fall into the ocean because it is three quarters of the planet but this thing is falling and precisely from this company they were asking us for many photos to try to capture the Cacho this rocket and that is the 12th of the puppy that is about to fall with look what  There are several photos, precisely what is beautiful. This was that several of our satellites ended up, which were just crossing it at different times, so with a little difference in hours or minutes, we have several photos and we can even see how the object is moving and things like that, but everything.  It started as a hack, well, another photo like that, quite a hacker This was half a marathon of working like this. A weekend and all because basically there was a big Expo where they were going to present things and so on, and the idea of ​​taking some crazy photo for  show at that Expo the theme was that the idea arose a few days before the Expo So there was little time to do things and the idea  It was let's try to take a photo of it Venice, which was a place where that event was held, but instead of taking the typical photo from above, everyone already saw photos from above, let's show that we can do something different So, instead of taking this photo towards  up we took it from the side you can close it is passing over how I take a picture from the side one thing I am not going to lower the satellite I have here what we did was constant saying well let's see we are used to looking when the satellite passes more or less  above a Target but you don't necessarily have to limit yourself to doing that for a photo you can tell when I'm passing by the side that is when I'm passing another area on the ground that is very to the side but turning enough the saté I can still see  that thing think that if the yacht is 400 kilometers high what it sees of the earth is not the entire planet they saw that if you look here at the Horizon  The point in which you sell a few kilometers long and then the curvature of the Earth means that you can't see more when you go up a building, for example, it's farther.  half of the planet well our ates at a given moment do not see half they see a circle of more or less 500 kilometers in diameter So in this case we say well let's look for a satin pass that is close to 500 kilometers away that we know that then it still does  you can see but what will be the most from the side you can see it practically see it on the horizon What kind of photo do we do with this a Spotlight we want to make the video looking towards Venice passing it from the side And why back for show Yes because we wanted to Show  that something strange could be done, the issue was, for example, our entire system of targets and others is limited by angles to find photos that serve the users  normal ios that are photos from above So what had to be done there very quickly develop a parallel branch where we say Well now all those limits that we set for normal photos now Forget everyone's or not everyone's but the majority but luckily ours the same  system now later I am going to tell you a little bit about why but I was quite prepared to do that the issue was later the precision of the aiming now is very different because the distance that this SAT ends up having is much more than any normal afternoon the little [ __ ] this  small before it was 400 km now it is much longer Yes then any error An error is increased that voice in the photo you saw that it moved a few meters now it is hundreds of meters capable of difference on the other hand also take with that photo like this to see it  with enough difference, that is, to see all of Venice with a lot of angle changes, it is a very long video if it is more or less about 10 mi  minutes of video we did not want to show 10 minutes of life and we had little in advance to download 10 minutes of video from the SAT it is a band yes it is a lot a lot a lot Data So for example some things we decided was to use only one band of the satellite sensor  the camera sensor has many bands resembling colors we used only one yes back hacking a bit configurations and things to say it did not use the others the disposable pixels but it came out How does that look it ended up being this here you see clouds coming out from the side that is like  if the clouds were already there but in reality it is because we are looking very far to the Horizon And what you see now there these spots are the Islands that they make and I don't know if it will be seen in the projector But there is a part where it crosses  You can't see the wake of an airplane. We actually crossed it, we actually see it from the front. It's not a unit. That came out another strange one.  I told them to capture the areas you can't make parallel strips that doesn't exist on earth if they all intersect then you have to do something different well we have a special maneuver to make strips that more or less do not intersect so much and so on and one  The thing that this maneuver allowed us to do was if we do a strip like this and the SAT is passing like this, basically that strip is being viewed more or less at a constant angle, but if you want to do several strips, recompose and so on, you have to start buying into the problem.  that you are no longer going to take out those strips at the same angle as the SAT is traveling the earth, that is, it has been traveling this stretch and now I cannot limit myself to always taking out strips that go in the same direction as this strait that I am in  traveling then perhaps in some pass I will have to make a fragment that is slightly deviated a little to the side yes Or I look like that so this maneuver allowed us  take photos that were not perfectly aligned with the path of the orbit with the line of knowing that we had before at the station crossing And that one day someone comes to me in view of chef we need a photo of 200 kilometers long perfect Yes one  photo 200 kilometers we do a lot of those what's the problem no Good but we need it to be downloaded quickly because it's for a demo for a client who is speaking well 200 kilometers nothing Nothing special when it happens to me at the target That's when I realize  Because it wasn't a normal photo, the target was completely perpendicular to the orbit. Skipping a crazy project that I don't know if in some country in the Middle East to make a mega city that is a line 200 kilometers long, that is, a city that  It is a single building 200 km long And they decided to make it aligned to the Equator, that is, completely lying down with respect to the planet, so the photo they wanted me to take was 200 kilometers  long but not like this but like this I mean, a complete Crusade of how the Sat came because then it seems like a customer challenge of this era they give us the limits to do that maneuver we had never tried such an extreme maneuver 200 kilometers means that if I am the satima I am  moving like this and the target is like this, I'm going to have to start looking forward to the right, for example, and I'm going to have to do this and turn around and finish like this.  The movement that the SAT has to make is quite quite violent again, hacking parameters, touching a little bit of configuration of things, taking out limits that we normally do not let it cross and so on. One night of work we ended up taking a photo that ended up looking like this, it is very  extreme quite outside the parameters of normal use So for example you see that it is not perfectly straight there are also a lot of  There are issues there that the earth is not perfectly spherical, it has elevation and so on, so according to the angle you are looking at the photo, the time further back later, when you reconstruct it, it does not look perfectly straight and one last thing, with that I am going to close the examples and then  so I get into how we made it work is the fact that the multi-target captures happen because of how we do our ates because of a lot of implementation detail that does not come in the case to take a photo you have to turn on a lot of devices first  prepare a bunch of gadgets then here this photo and then you have to encode it and save the frames and process them for download and Shut down and do the tirdown let's say a bunch of those gadgets that you were using that takes time it takes minutes I mean it's quite a long time when  you are wanting to do a Target from time to time that is not a problem but for example someone comes and tells you Che I want to get all the stadiums out of  and such a place all the others all the football stadiums in Spain They are a lot of dots that are all there together and you if you take the photo like this normal saying I do all the long preparation I take the photo and all the unprepared what will happen in  each pass in Spain you will be able to make a single Target Yes, but there are all those points So we are going to need a lot of passes, a lot of orbits on a lot of different days to make a lot of targets than the bandwidth to download them and everything gave you  But those times just aren't letting you do it so there he came up with an idea which was that we could treat all of those tablets with a single photo by simply adding maneuvers in the middle is saying for the camera for the camera software and it  that control the devices and more This is going to be a single photo we are going to take a photo but in reality during that photo we are going to be entering maneuver instructions saying  Well now point that one at it and now we insert another maneuver instruction that makes you point that one and now it points there And then it moves in the middle first problem of this is all the photos in the middle all the prizes in the middle are a disaster otherwise  they are useless They are of no use luckily we had a frame discard parameter So we pass those Range and we say all those discard them and save them then with very little we managed in some cases to say 4ply or whoever double the amount of Maybe we could do in  an orbit because now we pass through an area it has been a lot of targets all next to each other and the maneuvers allowed us to grab and take a lot of photos together so once again that was something that when it was designed no one imagined, that is, the  original design was camera turns on takes a picture of a target everything goes off and we end up doing nothing good yes camera turns on that's a picture but  You have five afternoons inside and then turn off everything and then download that. So how do we manage to make all these crazy things or these features that were asked of us that generally were not requested quickly, we can implement them and that they can be left running without having to be  rewriting all of this that was the planning software on the ground every time we wanted to take photos or products in a little bit different way Yeah that's where I think it's is the most useful part out there that you can get out of this talk and that is that  Mainly, what helped us to do this is having an architecture that is super extensible. We have already gone through a couple of plans, that is, this one that we have at the moment is not the first planner that we developed and one of the things that we learned with the plans.  previous ones was the plan in the software that is deciding what each satate that is Arming the sequence of instructions does and others knew about the pros  products that we make, that is, it had coreado inside the logic of a photo is done with this sequence of instructions a download is done with this other sequence such an experiment with this sequence But then what happened every time we wanted to do something crazy like one of these  You had to rewrite part of the plan, you had to get into the planner's code and say, well, no, now the photos can be in two different ways, so start putting them everywhere and things like that. So, a great thing that we developed in the plan.  What we are currently using was the fact of separating the planner itself, which is the software that is deciding what to do versus something that we call service request, which is a class that you ask when you can do useful things. What are the instructions that  you need to execute to do those useful things So the planner on this side says Well there are a lot of projects in there of things that  they want to do some are photos downloads experiment whatever he asks each of those Give me the list of dates when he can do something useful from so much a list begins to choose And he says Well I'm going to this one I think is more important I'll try to do  this but the planner does not have the logic of What is the sequence of instructions to execute that thing so when it says I want to execute This is going to do remember What are the instructions to execute this instructions the goal in the plan and there it validates that the limits of the sate  they didn't come across nothing broke there's enough power all that kind of thing and if everything went well that's within the plan So now when we want someone comes says Che now we're going to take multitasking photos instead of a single charge now we're going to  take out space objects all we have to do is create a new quest cell a new appointment class that can tell when you can do useful things and which ones  They are the instructions for each of those useful things that you want to do and that's it, you don't have to rewrite the planner for each of these crazy things. The other great thing that also helped us a lot to be able to do this is a very big change in focus from us before.  on the satellite the software because it ran on the satellite knew how to take a photo, that is, we told him in the plan to simply take a photo of such coordinates at such a time and it was the satellite that put together the sequence in instructions to take that photo but can you imagine  that when these crazy things appear that you need a different sequence of instructions that pass that case and you have to update the satellite software and remember that the satellites are not connected all the time, updating the satellite software and the satellite fleet is a  Big problem because I have to grab and upload a Blade that I can't upload when I want, I have to wait for each sate to have its passes  Let's see when it goes through a station and there I just upload each one about brave that applies And together upload a plan with the new one that takes advantage of this new logic if they are All the time changing and asking for things from one day to the next  and others I'm going to be with the whole fleet all the time because all the time the fleet is going to have half one version of the ones used by half another version and the plane is going to have to deal with both at the same time and all the ball  so one thing that we decided in the current versions of Software that we have is to say the sate is going to be stupid the sate the instructions that the satellite is going to run are stupid they are as atomic and low level as possible So for example the SAT has a turn on instruction  The camera, that is, has an instruction to execute such a maneuver, it has an instruction in elbow frames, we do not have an instruction to take a photo that does everything inside, because then if tomorrow Multi Target appears and we want to do so  Once maneuvers are done in the middle of the photo, we don't have to be doing any software Gray to the satellites, we simply change the plane on earth and now the planner, when he puts together the sequence of instructions, puts larger instructions in the middle of the satellite, that comes to them  the satellite is stupid the satellite says they told me to run the longest time at 3 in the afternoon and sits down and runs most of the afternoon he doesn't think about what for And when or anything is to do exactly what he told you on the ground other things too  What helped us a lot to be able to do all this is that we have a software mentality in the company, the traditional industry of the space industry, let's say we are not used to space agencies or things like that, has a mentality much more of long-term scientific projects.  term we have where they sit for five years to design something 5 or 10 years to manufacture it they launch it and use it maybe 20 years in space per  or when they launched it 15 years ago, it was defined exactly what are the instructions that the satellite is going to run and in what order and what do I know we have more of a mentality that this is a service that we are providing, how can you be providing a service with  a good website we are providing a service with satellites to run it is the service we need software and that software has to be developed interactively So in this Release there is the normal photo product and tomorrow a client appears who needs space photo and we release the Release that has  spatial photo And now we are giving you a service with spatial photo Yes, then no, we do not tie a Spec to such a long-term design and so on, but we iterate much faster using the same traditional software project development methodologies also help  to other things the fact that we use Hardware that we can launch newer satellites much more often and  More So, for example, we have computers with many Linux inside, something that is not common on satellites, and in this one of the technologies that a band helps us is python, yes, there probably should be more than one developer here, developer python python, the language that  It is very, very practical for quick literals, that is, it is a language that is very expressive, the code is very, very short, what you have to write to do things. So this allows you, for example, to write a planner that is very easy to extend and add those memories.  new and that kind of different things out there to the more traditional satellites and others that use very low-level things that in some cases have their advantages, you still need, for example, much less Hardware to run very low-level written instructions than what you  the Hardware that we need to run a plan that comes in a text file and is read by a python program from the other  do but it is what allows us later and quickly pull say now there is a new instruction in the satellite Well it is a Release a python package and it is uploaded and installed and that's it So basically That was what the Take away wanted to tell you  of this talk is the If you have things that you have to manage So you have to run and that you have to be changing a lot like the straps and others try to leave all the logic in the planner that you execute them try to make the executors the most  possible fools And that space can be done with more traditional technologies and more software methodologies and so on I hope you liked it for any questions And I'm also turning that around But now I think we have a little while for questions Well thanks for the  Quite interesting talk to a question in the past We have already seen attacks where they hijacked internet links from dvbs satellites there was an espionage group in the past the tourla that s  They hijacked the internet links So what I wanted to know how is the security today of the internet links of the internet links of communication with the satellites you use to secure the firewall connection or something I'm just inside the Security team inside  of satellite So the answer that I can give is very very very very beach about that, I think maybe someone was coming desatolosis of Security but one thing I can say is that an advantage that we have on our side is what was recently said that we use Linux  computers and other software much easier to do for sure than very high things that are common problems in the satellite industry. In other words, if someone is developing their own operating system for a satellite with their own architecture and so on, it is very difficult for these people to also be experts  in security and that they do that safely also in our case it is the SAT is running a normal computer with  In a normal Linux, then bring these Linux security experts and others and you can make it secure. The connection is a standard protocol connection that you already know is secure, that is, you have much more checking eyes and much more tools to make it secure than if you do everything.  very high and very low at a level very very yours let's say the cost of communication is still high cost of internet satellite communication communication with the satellite to communication with ground stations is relatively high Yes, it is the same for us, for example, we are at a point where we already  It is convenient for us to directly hire some of our own if we have dedicated stations and extras after that if we hire the shared ones but it is expensive Thank you very much how advanced are you in the Hardware of the satellite cameras with topics such as global chat or having smaller intervals  between frames and how do you deal with rolling hater if you don't have global shatter and ints  intervals between frames I don't know how much I can tell about that sorry and it's also not my area of ​​expertise I'm more into planner software so I don't know as much about camera hardware I still take the opportunity to answer the question you had from before about how we do it  the over whistle of that which may also be of interest to the rest the cameras have sensors those sensors measure photons that reach them they do not distinguish what color the buttons arrive I received 10 photons I received a thousand photons and nothing more filters are put on ahead  to the cameras to say Well, this sensor will only get red buttons, so it says I got 100 and you know that there are 100 red photons there but you also need next to it How much green and blue came to that same place then the cameras  cell phones, for example, in each pixel that generates the image for you, there are actually three little sensors or four little sensors with a different color filter, we don't  We do that the most differently, which is the sensor, we divide it into bands, it is the entire square of the camera from what it reads with all its little sensors, we divide it into bands and say here we put a red filter on it. So all these little sensors are going to see new red light  all this is in a different way green light and all this other blue light and then one more band of I don't remember what this So when you take a photo you have Rafaela yes you see the northern part of how much red light there was in the middle part of how much green light  there was at the bottom of how much Blue Light had proved that it was a color photo So what do you do it moves you take a first photo there then you moved a second photo where Now the green band overlaps with the blue one of the next photo and  another third photo and now the blue Red Band with the green one from the two previous ones so there you already have that band-aid that bit of color so that's why we are taking many photos per second for  you a whole stretch and we can reconstruct that strip in color there was a question back there, yes I ask two questions the first is each this maneuver implies how to spend fuel I understand and doing all these crazy maneuvers I understand that it has a higher cost because the  You can go up to fill the tank. Very good question. How do you ponder? Say, all these crazy rides are more expensive because the satellite dies earlier, in quotes, and the second is, How do you test what you are developing? Do you have a test satellite orbiting? Very good question.  also or directly I answer both as quickly as I can the first one you do to change orientation they do not use fuel what they use is electricity to move some very heavy wheels some wheels of money that are called basically they saw a helicopter that has a rotor and that  does it have a little mouse too or did they ever sit in a little boat and try to make for a solo  side what about the boat it tries to turn in the other direction yes or the helicopter turned the rotor that makes the body of the helicopter tries to turn in the other direction it is the same we turn a very heavy wheel very hard in this direction and then only the  The body of the satellite tends to roll in the other direction so you have wheels at several different angles and you make them all spin and you keep moving the tailor making it spin in the direction you think and all of that is all electrical So with the solar panels it's like that the  crazy maneuvers do not take time out of the satellite in that aspect, perhaps in other things it could be, but not in that aspect the other question was how do we test, on the one hand we have a lot of leaving the satellites on the ground available to test things on the ground and say well  The instructions of this computer will be able to run on time and we can test all of this with hardware on the ground, but then there are many other things.  like for example if the precision of directing these three maneuvers one after the other is going to be so violent well we have before testing I know we have a couple of disasters in store for these tests so we almost always run the testing attacks first we measure if all the  The metrics were well maintained by Deplo and the production acts and there we use that throughout the rest of the fleet. Thank you very much, super interesting, they come out, do you have any other questions, but the microphone in the middle is a row? Ok, ask how risky is it when doing these maneuvers?  crazy, it is based on gold and so on, as are all the maneuvers to change orientation, there is no risk of losing the orbit, so in fact the orbit falls by itself here in time and we raise it back up from time to time, but these maneuvers do not  they don't do that kind of thing to it If they have a lot of other risks for example one risk is not having to point the sensor at the sun because you're going  Let's say, let's say, there are a lot of limits and things that, even though we do crazy things, the satellite itself, the subsystems of the satellite have a lot of obstacles. Don't ask me to do this because I'm not going to leave it to you.  I have bumped into these obstacles I have bumped into, for example, trying to make a bathtub and he tells me the photo did not fail because when I go to see the lobez you wanted to point it at the sun so good good Yes very good question ask about the lifetime of our  ates and the problem of space junk that the two things are super connected our ates are designed to have a few years of life they are not like the traditional industry of a satellite that I am going to operate it for 20 years so it has to have chips that can withstand super radiation  expensive we say no ours will last three or five years in life and then we know that the radiation will not be enough but our ates comes out a thousand times less than we use  So with the traditional money you used to launch 20 years, we can launch a lot of sats and renew them and all, but that added a lot earlier. Right now, our ates are so small that when their lifetime is over, we can orbit them, we can let them  they fall and when they hit the atmosphere they pulverize basically there is nothing left So since they are low orbits and since they are small satellites in our case we are not contributing as much to this problem, ask if it is not an alternative instead of letting it fall to Earth  to deep space it is much more expensive in propulsion that you need to achieve that it would take almost one our gear is the size of a washing machine more or less to do one thing like that they would need three more satellite washing machines of only in fuel tank and all the ball  to have enough propulsion to pull off a thing like that then easier to just drop it and go [Music] ok good question  Unta ask how we resolved the issue of the focus I say if it is calibrated to focus on the earth and we are removing the space station that is up here if it is not out of focus let's say our ates these are heard well from optics maybe you can hear them for a little while because  I am going to say things that are surely wrong, but basically the focus of our ates is very wide, so you have a very, very large range in which anything will come out in focus, which is somewhat similar to the infinity focus in cameras. So that's the space station.  It still comes out in focus Even though we were I think 30 kilometers away from something like this and already 400 kilometers from the ground it is still in focus, so the problem of that issue was not for us, here there was one waiting Ok, ask if what I said a thousand times  Less is also considering the cost of sending it. I don't know how the cost of sending it is, yes, our arts are much lighter than the traditional p  But what they said a thousand times is not the cost of manufacturing the development and manufacturing of the SAT Yes, I'm sorry I don't hear you very well. What is the control they have regarding that they are not photographing military situations or intelligence and things like that, yes, good questions, I mean  There are two sides to that question. One question is the people on the ground who don't want us to take photos of us, like we respect that, how do they avoid those people, for example, how is China not letting us take a military station out of them or Germany, whoever that is?  There are international treaties on a whole legal issue that I don't know about, but from the technical side I get a list of areas that we don't have to take photos of and then when a client asks us for a photo if it's in that area we don't do it.  Another side is how we prevent our ate from being used by our clients from using our ate for harmful things. There is a whole process when a new client of Beto comes in, let's say  Investigate what they are going to make look at what they are and everything and if you want to be taking photos of such a country to go attack it we are going to tell you no Sorry I don't hear you very well since then when they tell me cut off I can't talk  three days to test, let's say, validate the pirouettes that the satellite does with a test satellite suddenly, let's say it also takes time, I don't have a simulator to validate them, so in the first instance, a good question, that is, we have a lot of simulation on the ground, in fact, the plan  In this one that I do that I work to plan the fleet, it really also has a lot of simulation inside if, for example, it simulates all the temperatures as it had evolved, it simulates how the sun will hit it, it simulates a lot of things like that, so part of all that  We validate it on land anyway, afterwards there is always a part that ends up surprising us that we did not expect to be done well.  s to Pizza With a loud applause whatever I'm going around we meet again after the
