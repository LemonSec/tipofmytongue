Introducing Kenbro With a round of applause [Applause] Well, as you just said My name is Kenbro I like to learn I like to develop I like to investigate I love privacy that's why the mask makes me feel more comfortable I'm also a member of the echo for those who don't know  which is you can go to room c and to the Stand we do experiments some go well some go wrong but they're fun okay This is a Turbo Talk So I'm going to try to go pretty fast Yeah let's talk a little bit about blockchain data collection  analysis of smart contracts and visualizations oriented towards scams scams of this type of scams pyramid scams no, people enter, invest and then cannot withdraw their money because there is a lack of liquidity in the contracts, well, I called the talk the scheme of the poor because I consider that only one  poor could fall for this scam believe you can get rich overnight it could be called a ponzi scheme because  It has to do with that, but Carlos Ponce was not the first to implement this type of scam, but there was a person named Baldomero Larra before, in Madrid in 1870, he achieved his first success. With this type of scam, a good scheme for the poor before  enter What happened and what we did I need those who are here to have some clear concepts I don't think anyone who is here has not heard of blockchain Yes, but to fix a bit of concepts what I am going to do  To do is give this concept in a very simplified way, which I am going to incur in some errors due to simplification. I liked the konex better because the chairs were screwed here, they are not screwed. They could throw me chairs if they wanted, but excuse me for these simplifications. I need everyone to understand  I personally consider blockchain to be the most beautiful poetry written with cryptography linked lists and distributed processing Yes but p  For those who don't know what I'm talking about, we could say that the blockchain is like a spreadsheet where I have the different sheets of the spreadsheet with names like block 1 block 2 block 3 when I stop editing that last spreadsheet it remains immutable and we can all do it.  see more or less that would be a blockchain that I can put a link to an article I can put text graphics sentences links we can put everyone but if we put commercial transactions yes from the newsletter they pass 100 bnb to the wallet 2 which are the bnb it doesn't matter  They can be pears, apples, it doesn't matter, it leaves a record of the transactions that are being made and I leave these transactions in this spreadsheet called blockchain that we can all see and that is immutable if apart from wallet they are also called addresses O addresses yes then in those  addresses are recorded how many I remove assets are inside simply by going through all those transactions This is the most i  Importantly, the other concept that I need you to have is the Smart Contract, which is a Smart Contra, which is a little program made in a program, for example Solidity, that runs within the blockchain in virtual machines called cbms. Ok, let's simplify it by going back to the spreadsheet  calculation a Smart Contract is still a Macro that runs within the spreadsheet and modifies that spreadsheet and the third concept that I need you to have is liquidity, which is liquidity And it is more or less this How much money is there  in a chest to carry out a commercial operation, no longer a fixed term of 30 days, not my grandmother's house that I have to sell and it took six months, that is what I already have. That is the concept of liquidity very simplified in blockchain, liquidity, that is,  The amount of cryptoactive money in a wallet looks more or less like this because as we can all see that big ledger we can know how much crypto  assets are in each wallet later it will be difficult for us to correlate those wallets with human beings well And this is the part of Story Time what happened was that a friend approached me and told me that he had been scammed last year in October at The gates of the  bear market that we have now in the cryptocurrency part my friend missed some stop losses the stop losses are what one is willing to lose in each operation that he opens and those operations were closed and my friend kept crypto dollars yes I call it  written dollars because they are the famous stablecoins that are tokens or cryptocurrencies there is a slight technical difference but let's take it as synonyms and these stable coins have a certain parity with the dollar, for example with any Fiat currency. Yes, to have that parity, how can we back it with smoke?  same as the dollar. Then we found ourselves with a lot of crypto dollars under a crypto mattress and my friend started thinking I'm lost.  I am losing if I have this under the mattress I am losing the reality is that no the reality is that one is not winning and the reality is that one is not winning yes and yes it is a good operation because at the doors of a bear market do  A good trading operation is quite difficult. Well, my desperate, ambitious friend started looking for what he could do with those writers and he found pages like this. Yes, it says something like leave your bnbs, which is the cryptocurrency that is going to happen in a month.  have 234% more yes or you came across this one that says leave us your B usd which is the stable coin of binance and the yield is going to be 241 percent or this other page that says leave us your usdt which is the stable with the best known and  you are going to get 241 percent added to this there is a simulation that if you leave 50 dollars for 30 days you get 120 with 50 if you leave 5000 dollars you will get 12 thousand dollars that is unreal that is unreal but the head of the s  er human and on top of this if you do that the more and more people will have a higher percentage of return well this looks like a scam yes it looks like a scan 241% Warren buffett who is an investor an old man was born 15 minutes later  that mirtha legrand is one of the best investors in the world and they did a study throughout his life and all his investments and gave him a yield of 18% per year and here we are talking about 241 percent per month  In other words, 2,800 percent This is not supported by anything but my friend put his money there and lost half of the investment so he came desperate and told me what we can do with this Well what did we do first we can avoid going through all that spreadsheet  With all these operations we can use what is called the Blockchain Explorer, mainly we use it in pods because that's where the scam took place. This is what allows us to have as a summary if a  Something more detailed or not so much since it looks like a web 1.0 and one can put the Hash of the contract you can put the Hash of the transaction you can put and get information in particular this screen already has the Hash of the contract and there we can see the balance that would be the  liquidity What is the developer the address of the developer the address within the blockchain no no where it lives we have the transactions we have the transfers that generate those transactions etc etc etc then We with this not actually escaping the page but using the knowledge provided in the part  free For which reason the collection is slower we collect absolutely all the data referring to that contract yes all the wallets that operated the functions that executed etcetera etcetera we persist that in a normal falsistant Jason And using a little pandas Data frame for those who know  programming in python we begin to accommodate the data we begin to accommodate  give the data And we began to see who had lost everything who had lost something who had won something who had won above the promised percentage that was when our heads made us squishy there were people who had won more than 241%.  and I hadn't even waited a month, so we said well, let's build an API and start graphing this much better to take dimension of what they are doing, but above all, we wanted to know how they were doing it and for that we built a frontend of what we wanted to show on the  pediment was a summary of the contract, the behavior, the Source code of the contract, the contract diagram, a distribution graph and that would allow us to see how the cryptomoney flow was and a detail of the transactions. Good And here comes the part where everything  It can go wrong if this is a terminal, we're going to do it like this. Basically, you can pass it the address of the contract. You can limit the collection based on a block from and block it if they don't pass that directly. This Starts with the beginning of the contract and runs through  to date, because when the contracts are deployed in the blockchain, they remain there, yes, but one can limit how  or this I told you Jason persists in the false System So later one can make references to Jason it is analyzed and the visualizations are shown well I obviously so that this is much between the eyes I took one as it is a contract a scam contract that  it only lasted seven days only seven days I collected 23 days but you will see that the contract lasted only seven days there all the humanizations are running accommodating the data a touch what is called data science the same is not a lot of volume And a visualization in this wakes me up  Well, now we are going to see it. Well, there is the presentation of the project, which is not very interesting, and here we have a summary of the contract, what does this summary tell us? What is the address of the creator of the contract? It tells us from which block To which Block with date  If I can delimit this collection, it tells me what is the address of the contract what is the building block and the two most important numbers that  They are the largest, it tells me how much volume passed through that contract. How much money flowed through that contract. Well, this contract that we are going to see, which lasts seven days, handled the volume of 2 million 839 thousand dollars only in seven days and its maximum volume, that is, how long it was  The more full that chest was with one million 227 thousand dollars in detail, we began to see the number of transactions that took place in that contract, the transfers that gave rise to those transactions, note that here we have a graph with how the money entered and how abruptly the  liquidity of the contract and above all what caught our attention are these numbers here those numbers say that 5,287 wallets interacted with the contract if we cannot correlate it with humans there are 5,287 wallets 670 all lost 3610 lost something 762 managed to recover or win something  but the number that attracts the most attention is that there are 245 that are earning above expectations.  VAT from the contract yes those 245 are earning more than what was promised in the contract that was what caught our attention and that is why we made these graphs because we loaded Jason into a Jupiter Notebook I don't know if anyone knows that's where we started  to make some preliminary graphs and we ended up making this software another of the things that we provide is the source code of the contract so that they can review it plus a diagram of the contract yes one may not know programming to read the diagram and see that there is a there is a commission  For the developer, there is a commission for the marketing person, there is a commission for the CEO, there is a commission for the game they were financing, there is a commission for the developer's grandmother, obviously, this looks very bad, and the most important graphic is this. This is a  bubble chart where each dark bubble is a blockchain address that interacts with the contract The largest bubble is the con  deal itself and the other two bubbles are proportional before software it had another pediment and it was more green and red but we really wanted to get the emotion out of this and that's why we are graphing it with cool colors yes So we have that in each wallet the out is what  who took out the wallet It was taken out of the wallet, that is, it was invested in the contract and the Inn is what could be recovered. Well, the bubble that attracts the most attention is this big one, but we discovered that it was not anyone in particular, it was a person who had invested  450 thousand dollars yes and he was able to get them out and earn 6% of those 450 thousand dollars yes later You can go browsing through this no And we can I don't know Browse randomly there We have one that earned 12% there we have another that lost a  38% and there we have another one that lost 57%, yes Here is the number of transactions that the money you invested was made and that you were able to withdraw and a list of all the transactions that that wallet made against the  contract well so far everything normal everything normal but we found a wallet that only has Inn well this coincides with the developer So it would also have to be discarded because all that came in from commissions Yes and another of the things here is for example one that lost it  everything Yes and this is the one that lost the most of all these bubbles that attract attention lost 100% lost 66 thousand dollars yes well and until then nothing we can continue browsing to see what we found and it occurred to us to move towards the limits yes  of the contract and we began to see bubbles like this where the proportionality of what we had recovered is much greater than what we had invested but much larger, enormously larger. Remember this contract lasted seven days. The promise of this contract is 241% per month. We began to find these tiny bubbles  Yes, it still earned 2,790 percent, that is, the guy put in 50 dollars and took out 14,500 dollars, yes, well, but notice that he is  It's not the only one I keep moving to the sides and I find another if it won 14.517 percent and if I keep moving we'll go anywhere else because this repeats itself terribly Here's another one if it won 3.489% and another and another Yes and if  we move to another part of the contract we are going to see that this this pattern this pattern repeats itself a lot Here is another one if those 245 wallets plus or minus 10 wallets are the ones that were being used to drain little by little and invisibly  this project there are other types of scams called skame exit that what they do is increase liquidity all the people get excited This is perfect and suddenly with a transaction they get everything good This is not the case the detection we did with this in  particular is how they are draining with other wallets very little by little the liquidity of the contract as I told you before also the list of transactions if you apply in any item of this  The list of transactions shows me the portion of the code that is being executed in the diagram with the parameters of the transaction encoded And what transfers that transaction triggered because we have to give the commission to the grandmother, the commission to the developer, etc., etc. Well, once we show  This software was approached by a person and said they can't do early detection, we didn't program it for that, but simply after returning home, instead of passing the entire contract, what we pass on is the collection of Only one day of the contract, I won't go  to go back to explain all the tabs but when we go to distribution we see that there are obviously the Out Bubbles are very increased because they are the beginnings of putting money into the contract and yet the first day and moving back to the periphery of this we find that  the first day there is someone who won 552%.  Yes, on the first day there is someone who won 1,500 percent and so If we move along the sides we can find a way to drain this type of scam, well, our objective was to discover those responsible, obviously we found this way of draining it and  It is much more intractable than if a scalexit had been carried out and one can begin to trace that single wallet, here we would have to trace 245 wallets. So, that's good. This is a stage that we have pending.  Actually, this description of the project is that the project was created from the anger that my friend lost his money, then we have a technical description where it says that it is Open Surf that we collect in terminal mode, we have the ethereum blockchain pending.  ethereum blockchain is if actually pods is a broction code ford of ethereum so it's not  or early detection should not cost us so much that we are already detecting these anomalies and being able to trace them. We have this software pending, I think that at the beginning of next year we will have it and then identify the web that is  something Much less likely but we are going to try as I told you this project is called you can download it from gitlab from github and there is a page that describes the project I'm in time for questions here I leave my networks so you can contact me Good afternoon everyone My name  It is Facundo I introduce myself I am the president of the kenbro hater club and as such I want the first question I have been asking for This sounds familiar to me I have a friend who is not me So the question is your friend the doctors say yes the doctors say yes  yes It's not really schizophrenia because I don't see it But I hear voices and not the same We don't get along but he looks like my friend it's me but I'm not  the number one member of the Viking club how much did you lose [Applause] I'm not going to say because I don't know if there are people from AFIP here so this no no no I don't want to give numbers I don't want to give numbers but it hurt me it hurt me it hurt a lot  In fact, notice that it hurt me so much that I spent my time doing this to find people to kick the [ __ ] some technical questions like I don't know what you think about blockchains and it exacerbates this I don't know something more technical let's see Hi, I'll tell you  I wanted to ask a question on the subject of bitcoin, that is, generally, currencies drop in relation to bitcoin and I wanted to ask more than anything, how did you handle it with that case of Vic? Ah, anyone is asking me for financial advice.  Guys, give me a second. We are always going to be responsible for the [ __ ] they do investing and even in Latam, well, first let's separate one thing. This was a scam that anyone can enter.  ra and it can be done in any currency and it can and can be outside the blockchain let's say it's not this type of scam with respect to the question that you ask me that has nothing to do with anything but it refers to trading you don't have to  analyze to see if they are in a rise of only bitcoin the other currencies accompany and many times the governance that is the amount of money moves to the part of alcoins is It is difficult to determine when and lie in bitcoin and when to invest in  other things the only recommendation that I am going to give you regarding that which has nothing to do with the talk is that you study the projects behind each cryptocurrency this was not a project it was not a cryptocurrency project It was one of these projects  type crypto games type cryptocar I don't know if anyone fell into cryptocar which is not to fall because they were not They were not scams crypto Cars the guys did not know much technically and their scalability collapsed the same p  It was like plan vs anded I think it was plan vs Zombies this one I still have my axis but hey what's up I'm a very young member of the fan club I wanted to know how you found this magical investment opportunity where you were digging the internet for  to get to such a beautiful place if you go to Google and put How to get rich easily the first thing that jumps are these things there is no more there is no more explanation than that no one else wonders like there is someone who wants to ask questions yes the idea  of the project is to keep it open or the idea of ​​all the projects I do is to keep them offenders actually contact me and I say Come back subscription is 50 dollars you leave it to me not the idea The idea is to keep it Open source and the idea is to keep seeing how far  we arrive and add the ethereum blockchain add other blockchains too so it can detect where it is and do this type of analysis asks which one  It was that game that was called Big Game, someone fell into Big Game or it was just me. I wanted to say Big Game to my friend, but that's what everyone does, like cryptocars. Guys, they get in early and we're going to sell them in the cars. No no no no no no  no good no no no no 5,287 less 245 Well it is an interesting number especially in seven days that is, in 7 days 5000 wallets I lost a little more than 50 percent not so bad Yes but good thanks Thanks Paco any more questions How is he responsible  pods in reality what we did what we could do is ready these wallets we identified them all and filed a complaint all these wallets that presented this anomaly pods open with shrimp let's say because many times using the pod network does not mean that  go have them identified or anything like that But if it was denounced and all those wallets were reported, care was taken of there are wallets that are not fine that are  There, for example, the one from the one from the developer, it's good that it's there, no, yes, but it was clarified, this is the developer's wallet, this is the marketing one, this is SEO and all these are wallets created on purpose to drain the contract if they could be  see the wallets of the developer, the marketing one and that of the great-aunt, you couldn't look for these people and hold them responsible for the fraud.  of calculation that everyone can see makes it possible for everyone to know who and not who Which wallets have how much at any time note that there are pages that analyze the whales why because one can know which are the wallets that have the most crypto assets regarding a project we all know  Which are the ones that have the most etherium we all know Which are satoshi nakamoto's wallets That is not This is not anonymous we all know  Which are the exact ones from Camacho city and that they are full of bitcoin and that the day they move they will sit down with bitcoin From there they all ran out to sell bitcoin no But we know who satoshi nakamoto is we don't know what his wallet is if we know that  This is what happens in the world of cryptocurrency, we can know which wallets have what but not Who is behind it unless they go through a centralized exchange like pods or like any of those who have to go then it will be possible to identify  but they don't use that type of bill, they just use these little wallets. In fact, my intervention, my friend's intervention in the contract, was through a Random wallet in the metamask because I didn't want them to identify me later, it did require that they identify me as one of  the victims but any questions rather we say goodbye to kenbro here
