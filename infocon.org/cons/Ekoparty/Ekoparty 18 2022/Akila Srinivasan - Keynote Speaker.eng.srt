1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,179
foreign

2
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,690
through them

3
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,750
[Music]

4
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,730
[Music]

5
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,119
thank you

6
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,759
[Music]

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,220
I post good morning thank you for being

8
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,100
here bright and early it's an honor to

9
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,720
speak here at Echo party and I thank you

10
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,159
for having me here

11
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,320
so for the past few days you've learned

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,600
so many aspects of security threat

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,640
intelligence exploitation and

14
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,939
engineering cutting down that path I

15
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,320
want to spend some time discussing

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,180
another possible direction of taking a

17
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,280
security career through building versus

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,119
breaking and it's a little more about

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,579
how my journey and security has shaped

20
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,020
up

21
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,880
so to kick things off a brief agenda

22
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,038
I'll go in depth on my career journey

23
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,220
and how it changed my views on security

24
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,080
my perspectives on the definition of

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,000
security in Big versus small companies

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
the various events that have now

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,900
impacted the tech landscape and have

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,819
accelerated the inevitable

29
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,739
I'll talk about opportunities to

30
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,780
capitalize on to help build more secure

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,120
products and the goal through a lot of

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,860
this discussion today is to highlight

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,379
various aspects you should consider when

34
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,700
you're trying to make more informed

35
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,440
decisions on how you see yourself

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,959
growing and evolving in this particular

37
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,220
field

38
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,140
I personally really like Pokemons so

39
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,459
you'll see a lot of gifs throughout this

40
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,379
entire presentation it's also a fun

41
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,940
morning presentation

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,620
so to kick things off a little about me

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,660
I studied engineering where I was taught

44
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,940
various aspects of computer science it

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,680
gave me a very high level view of

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,239
security but not enough to have an

47
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
opinion to have a strong opinionated

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,319
thought about this field

49
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,300
Microsoft was my first job out of

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,800
college and it gave me perspective of

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,239
security at scale

52
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,980
the security at Microsoft could mean

53
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,780
many many many things simply because

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,459
Microsoft does everything and you build

55
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,019
software and service for billions of

56
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,280
people

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
from there I moved to Apple and worked

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,700
as an engineer in the security

59
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,980
engineering and architecture group and

60
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,080
then I moved uh to becoming an

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,580
engineering manager there

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,900
Apple changed the way I looked at

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,239
security and privacy I learned more

64
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,760
about usable security and to make a real

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,739
positive impact to your customers it

66
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:29,940
doesn't matter how secure your product

67
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,620
is if your customers actually don't know

68
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,780
how to make use of those features to

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,360
make themselves more secure so you being

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,099
incredibly talented and smart it doesn't

71
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,200
matter if no one knows how to do the

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,840
thing that you told them to go to

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
um

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,980
privacy and user trust principles are

75
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,080
often baked into the ground up and the

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,879
benefit of working in a big tech company

77
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,340
that has seen it all like Microsoft and

78
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,799
Apple it gave me the benefit of learning

79
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,659
by standing on the shoulders of giants

80
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,019
so often before I would make a mistake I

81
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,519
would have some support system that

82
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,080
would give me some guidance on hey you

83
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
probably consider a different approach

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,260
than going down this path because many

85
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,840
of us have already been down this path

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
As I Grew in my career I realized I

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
wanted to learn more about software

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
security adjacent Tech Stacks so trust

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
and privacy being them so I took a

90
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
different Adventure by joining Lyft

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,540
specifically the Privacy engineering and

92
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,740
the data security teams there

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,780
um and most recently I joined notion

94
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,280
security and Trust engineering team

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,979
notion is a smaller company a much

96
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,199
smaller company and it does primarily

97
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,180
office productivity software

98
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,699
so what is security at a big tech

99
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,160
company actually mean

100
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,820
um

101
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,500
to talk a little more about Microsoft

102
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,720
and Apple generally and take all of this

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,199
with companies that build software for

104
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,000
other engineering teams so for other

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,820
software companies

106
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,080
firstly I'm not a spokesperson for any

107
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,699
of these companies so take everything I

108
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,040
say as my perspective it's what I did

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,139
years ago and things have probably

110
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,720
changed in the Dell test and so when I

111
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,860
worked at the companies to where I'm

112
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,139
right now

113
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,759
um security firstly at both these

114
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,620
companies are defined by who their

115
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,139
customers are Microsoft is huge in the

116
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,000
Enterprise space so things pro think of

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,639
products like Azure and office 365.

118
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,580
apple is primarily a consumer product so

119
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,280
think of iPhones Mac watch those types

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
of devices so moving on to products then

121
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,080
Microsoft has many many many many

122
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,740
security teams you ask in Microsoft if

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,300
one security team knows the other they

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,919
probably don't and that's because they

125
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,720
have so many diverse products that are

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,300
shipping such different software the

127
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
type of engineering that would be

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,539
required for Windows is going to be very

129
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,860
very different from the type of

130
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,120
engineering that's going to be required

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,060
for Azure and Office 365 because your

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,400
Baseline Technologies are very different

133
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,680
uh this often honestly took me by

134
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,380
surprise because I assumed that it's one

135
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,539
Microsoft

136
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,479
but it does make sense a back-end

137
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,520
service or a back if it is a bug in a

138
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,500
back-end service it would take it would

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
be fixed in a matter of hours you

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,380
wouldn't even know that there was a bug

141
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,940
that needed to be patched because all of

142
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,080
a sudden there was just an update

143
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,360
because it's all server side you know

144
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,300
when Windows wants you to take a patch

145
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,460
and it takes a couple of days with all

146
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,560
Engineers on Deck to actually get it out

147
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,060
because it has to go through intense

148
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,100
testing

149
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,199
the next is karia so you understood what

150
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,759
what the types of customers are the

151
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,020
types of products that you need to ship

152
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,220
out

153
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,880
um

154
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,860
a career in Microsoft could literally

155
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,240
mean anything

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,639
you take any field of security and it

157
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,440
exists the security design where you can

158
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,240
think about it more proactively there's

159
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,860
threat modeling and response there's

160
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,120
threat intelligence and threat

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,800
intelligence could be detecting and

162
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,560
monitoring for the systems itself or

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,880
detecting and monitoring for your

164
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,259
customers like endpoint detection

165
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,080
systems or Windows Defender or whatever

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,300
you have program management you have

167
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,520
security feature development you have

168
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,919
Hardware software Solutions and then you

169
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,419
have Security based on if you are

170
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,919
developing it for Enterprise customers

171
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,940
versus developers versus in

172
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,360
customers like us

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,699
what so response and the reason I want

174
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,680
to call out response is a lot of my

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,300
Microsoft career was focused on this but

176
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,880
also because um a lot of people write

177
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,740
security bugs and send them to Microsoft

178
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,240
either for their bug Bounty programs to

179
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,800
get them fixed

180
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
um

181
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,180
threat intelligence and response teams

182
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,680
at Microsoft are pretty big they're

183
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,419
about 30 to 40 individuals at least this

184
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,699
was before the time when I left for all

185
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,560
the security researchers who regularly

186
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,020
submit bugs they do look at your bugs

187
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,880
and they do get back to you however if

188
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,039
you'll notice it's not it's the timing

189
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,479
could be very unpredictable and that's

190
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,919
because they get hundreds of emails

191
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,440
every day some of them may be real bugs

192
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,599
some of them not real bugs so you want

193
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:49,860
to try and front load as much

194
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,919
information as possible to get the most

195
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,099
possible to get the quickest response

196
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,539
but response at Microsoft could also

197
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,460
mean you have an engineering team you

198
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,199
have a program management team you have

199
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,180
a release management team all these

200
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,740
teams need to work together to help

201
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,599
evaluate when the bug needs to get fixed

202
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,160
and then either take a fix immediately

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,940
if it's a server side fix or take a fix

204
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,080
eventually if it actually affects

205
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,759
software products so Patch Tuesday and

206
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,960
all of that

207
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,780
on the flip side when I worked at Apple

208
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,520
response was actually a lot leaner there

209
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,440
was a lot more Automation in generally

210
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,660
in Apple's culture so we had to do as

211
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,099
much as we can to make the machine do

212
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,960
the thing for you

213
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,520
um it was also there were fewer security

214
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
teams at Apple and again the reason

215
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,458
being is because Apple has lesser

216
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,599
products there's not much of the

217
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,039
Enterprise space there right you've

218
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,020
you've yes compared to like the sheer

219
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,339
amount of things that Microsoft ships

220
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,559
out you've also got lesser versions of

221
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,659
Mac OS and iOS software you to maintain

222
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,520
you have like I think n minus two at the

223
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,500
most and at least when I worked at

224
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,600
Microsoft there was a time when I we had

225
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,120
to maintain n minus 25. so you've got 25

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,279
different variations of software so

227
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,260
shipping security bugs for that just

228
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,940
takes a lot longer

229
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,880
either way these are Global Tech Giants

230
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
and shipping software for billions of

231
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,380
people worldwide it makes sense to

232
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,880
generally for them to generally have

233
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,399
bigger security teams

234
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,920
security at a smaller tech company is

235
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,899
actually very different when you work at

236
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,180
a smaller company or a company who is

237
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,940
shipping security for a product that is

238
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,580
in software so think like Banks oil and

239
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,880
gas even like

240
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,060
um stores that are things that serve

241
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,980
restaurants your point of sale system

242
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,040
and all of that this Security is to

243
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,700
drive the business it isn't the business

244
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,260
um your definition of security changes

245
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,600
it's less about creating best-in-class

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,760
mitigations it's about building a

247
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
foundation of security to help push

248
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,019
defense and depth for all of your

249
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,640
Solutions and your most susceptible

250
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,720
assets

251
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,820
it could require your engineers to fix

252
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,399
very critical bugs but it could often be

253
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,260
as simple as implementing an identity

254
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,300
provider internally you need to figure

255
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,399
out what your company needs and then use

256
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,160
security as an enabler not focus on what

257
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,680
could be the best possible interesting

258
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,140
work that you could instead do

259
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,180
um as a smaller company you have very

260
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,980
targeted customers and they will tell

261
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,660
you exactly what they need from you to

262
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,000
get for you to get their business if

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,100
security becomes the ask then as a

264
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,660
security team you need to chip in and do

265
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,180
what it takes this could be getting a

266
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,580
sock compliance or a PCI compliance for

267
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,500
folks in the financial industry it could

268
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,300
also mean just making sure you can

269
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,040
attest that the assets that the company

270
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
stores in your systems is actually

271
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,080
secure so doing the basics that you need

272
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,660
to do to help Drive Revenue sometimes

273
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,100
that does become the security Charter

274
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,300
and I think it's a very meaningful

275
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,160
Charter because you actually move away

276
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,720
from being a cost center to a profit

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
Center

278
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:44,940
um

279
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,459
as your career evolves you'll realize

280
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,260
that working in a smaller company or

281
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,360
working in a company that is not

282
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,120
creating tech for tech will give you a

283
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,579
lot more breadth than depth you end up

284
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,200
becoming the Jack of many trades and

285
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,240
often very quickly they don't know who's

286
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,860
going to go solve this program this

287
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,420
problem you have some subject matter

288
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,519
expertise in an adjacent area so why

289
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,680
don't you go solve it so take advantage

290
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,940
and capitalize on a lot of those

291
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,480
opportunities

292
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,660
um

293
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,820
actually one more thing to call out here

294
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,920
is you are often going to be on the hot

295
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,019
seat of defining build versus buy from

296
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,640
my conversations in the last few days

297
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,620
I've learned a lot more about

298
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,940
uh how security decisions get evaluated

299
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,040
it is interesting and important to

300
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
consider Security Solutions that

301
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,240
actually foundationally help you when

302
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,680
you're thinking about build buses by

303
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
decisions uh most of them

304
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,220
can are very Point systems so take a

305
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,220
step back and learn about how this buy

306
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,779
solution can actually impact your

307
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,640
long-term roadmap not just the short

308
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,160
term one-year plan

309
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,980
so we we briefly discussed my career

310
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,779
journey and then my perspective of

311
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,760
working in a big versus small company

312
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,680
so let's move on to the observations on

313
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,300
how the security business is actually

314
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
still booming despite of the very

315
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,300
deteriorating macro climate

316
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,100
the first change is the pandemic it

317
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,899
changed the world quite a bit and the

318
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,459
past few years we have seen companies

319
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,140
make significant adjustments to

320
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,420
accommodate it the panel the pandemic

321
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,220
brought about fundamental change that

322
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,540
disrupted the core of how people

323
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,820
interact with work systems it now

324
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,220
happens everywhere from very from

325
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,779
significantly less controllable

326
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,839
environments remote work economic

327
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
uncertainty and an overall breakdown of

328
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,820
the known societal Norms has changed the

329
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,620
way the world operates it's a lot more

330
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,120
common for you to now get onto a zoom

331
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,800
call than an action and a real phone

332
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
call with someone

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,920
um

334
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,620
to be fair we were already headed down

335
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,300
this path

336
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,740
um Zoom didn't come up during the

337
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,660
pandemic like Google meets didn't happen

338
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,459
during the pandemic we already took

339
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,600
advantage of a lot of these VoIP

340
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,459
Technologies

341
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,380
um but the pandemic was a forcing

342
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,120
function to accelerate the pace of

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,980
adopting these changes and now it's our

344
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,360
job to help keep up with these

345
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,500
disruptions

346
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,839
so talking about the most obvious change

347
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
and how it affected security is remote

348
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,160
work the work the move to remote work

349
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,740
has accelerated the move to distributed

350
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,779
networking and decentralization

351
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,300
individual devices and accounts are the

352
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,120
easiest points of entries for most hacks

353
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,100
scaling of remote work has multiplied

354
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,959
Enterprise security risk and has

355
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,060
accelerated the move for minimal Trust

356
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,160
on devices it has also increased

357
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,440
monitoring

358
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,480
so organizations now need a more

359
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,639
scalable way of answering questions that

360
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,220
keep coming up regarding the identity of

361
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,800
an employee this is a recurring theme it

362
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,180
isn't anything new as a part of a

363
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,040
security group you often are already

364
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
doing your analysis on like is this user

365
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,700
who they say they are is this employee

366
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,440
who they say say they are

367
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,200
the pandemic has exacerbated all of this

368
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,760
is the person accessing our system

369
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,139
actually an employee what are the

370
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,360
resources we should give them if we

371
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,220
should give them these resources do they

372
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,440
have the right education in order to

373
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,180
know how to interface with these systems

374
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,339
what software is on their laptop what

375
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,779
additional control should we have on

376
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,519
that software they just went ahead and

377
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,320
downloaded an arbitrary Google extension

378
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,240
that seems kind of sketch do you have an

379
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,779
ability to actually control that

380
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,880
when they're at home and not on a work

381
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,920
computer what can and cannot what can

382
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,660
they do and what should they not do

383
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,040
there are lots of things that they

384
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,480
should not do and people have to a

385
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,800
certain extent broken down these

386
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,980
barriers when they work from home

387
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,839
if you finally have to take someone off

388
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,540
the company chart the comp if someone is

389
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,040
to leave your company and you have to

390
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,560
get someone off-boarded it isn't an easy

391
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,600
thing to do anymore you need to go

392
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,160
figure out what sensitive assets

393
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,139
actually live on their machine that you

394
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,779
don't really control anymore and how do

395
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,760
you get that ahead of time

396
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,920
so all of this traditionally falls under

397
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,320
corporate or Enterprise security it's an

398
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,360
area of security I believe most people

399
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,940
take for granted there are there are

400
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,980
plenty of software Solutions out there

401
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,920
and it's also the very Tech jargon heavy

402
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,899
space I personally learn a lot more

403
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,639
acronyms every day in this space or

404
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,500
maybe on a weekly basis I come on to

405
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,820
LinkedIn and there's a new blog article

406
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,380
about this interesting startup they're

407
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,480
doing something with a with a free

408
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,980
letter of highlighter acronym that I'm

409
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,720
hearing for for the first time these are

410
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,279
fundamentally the same Technologies over

411
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,639
and over again repurposed and repackaged

412
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,560
um the other assumption we make is that

413
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,300
we dismiss this area expecting the

414
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,339
internal I.T team to take care of it and

415
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,959
that's not the case because these are

416
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,279
the things that often lead to breaches

417
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,079
and it's going to be a security person

418
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,740
who has to answer for this not I.T

419
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,019
um it also should fall it it makes sense

420
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,760
it falls under Securities prerogative

421
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,279
it's your responsibility to to care

422
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,680
about your digital Kingdom and your

423
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,639
assets

424
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,440
so a few things that I have seen change

425
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,060
in the Enterprise security space as

426
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,040
we've moved towards remote work the

427
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
first one is endpoint protection

428
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,699
significantly better detection control

429
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,519
monitoring capabilities have uh the

430
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,959
pandemic has given rise to a lot of

431
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,139
these you have much better event

432
00:15:58,139 --> 00:15:59,639
management systems than you previously

433
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,980
did and they help with effortless data

434
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,220
uh ingestion they also take data now

435
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,139
from very common log sources like you

436
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,420
have identity providers you have your if

437
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,579
you do MFA then you have your totp

438
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,920
providers you have AWS integration that

439
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,079
gets built in you have log normalization

440
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
as a part of it and finally they give

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,740
you a much better ability of writing

442
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,320
detections on it and they also give you

443
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,699
Baseline detections that you could just

444
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,579
inherit investing in a strong endpoint

445
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,820
protection system can actually help get

446
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,100
you to a more proactive path of ensuring

447
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,660
Enterprise security

448
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,120
the second one is MDM a lot of us have

449
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,399
worked with VPN Solutions VPN Solutions

450
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,459
don't really uh scale when devices start

451
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,519
moving to a lot more remote Focus

452
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,139
because often you need to now ship a

453
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,180
device to someone if they can't come

454
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,820
into your VPN network to go work from

455
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,220
your HQ or something of that sort so

456
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,500
mdms it's given the rise to mdms or

457
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,420
other thinner clients that help keep

458
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,459
sensitive devices off individual worker

459
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,800
devices individual sorry that keep

460
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,600
sensitive data of individual worker

461
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,040
devices altogether but also give you

462
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,660
better control

463
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,880
finally more awareness of the security

464
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,640
space in general I think everyone now

465
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,280
knows almost everyone here has been a

466
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,500
part of a breach as a consumer or is

467
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
aware of at least what's going on in the

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,679
larger ecosystem

469
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,660
more awareness about overall security

470
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,240
industry is the best defense in depth

471
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,939
because a lot of Enterprise security has

472
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,559
to deal with people management this

473
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,780
people process technology

474
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,520
it is all about people in this category

475
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
too

476
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,460
so it's not just Engineers or Security

477
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,960
Professionals who now have to care about

478
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,640
security it needs to be security

479
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,700
education and awareness for everyone

480
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,559
um and it needs to be a healthy dose of

481
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,919
paranoia such that if someone in an

482
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,720
arbitrary team who has never dealt with

483
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,059
that comes across a sketchy text message

484
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,100
saying that we need you to log into the

485
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,020
system they take a step back and think

486
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,760
twice do I really need to log into the

487
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,799
system or is this something that would

488
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,620
am I being the vector of compromise for

489
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,480
my company that is a sort of larger

490
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,240
cultural change that needs to happen

491
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,039
the second thing and personally this is

492
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,260
my most favorite is data ubiquity

493
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,660
data is everywhere and hence it needs to

494
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,580
be considered as a new endpoint and

495
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,740
should be at par with software IP that

496
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,179
needs protecting

497
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,340
traditionally security has always

498
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,559
focused on supporting systems that store

499
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,440
data rather than the data itself and

500
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,419
this will need to change security

501
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,700
dollars are moving towards data which

502
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,980
means that you not only have to create a

503
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,780
more you you not only have to create a

504
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,220
wall Garden around your data but

505
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,900
actually make sure the information

506
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,080
itself is kept in a way that will

507
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,020
prevent damage if compromised

508
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,940
there are so many opinions about data

509
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,520
being the new oil the new gold of the

510
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,160
digital economy it's now a lot of

511
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
actually new systems are also built on

512
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,360
data versus code so it is getting in my

513
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,980
opinion even more important than code

514
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,000
itself

515
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,160
and software Engineers are actually

516
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,720
working with data as much as they were

517
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,700
working with code in all honesty you'll

518
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,900
have a lot more people in your company

519
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,880
work with data than code

520
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,919
and it a data here doesn't necessarily

521
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,780
mean customer data it could also mean

522
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,059
analytical metadata collected to help

523
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,460
understand your user your customers your

524
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,380
user interaction with your actual system

525
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,440
it could be logging information on like

526
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,059
how often does the customer log into

527
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,620
your device everything that's pertaining

528
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,480
to audit logs about that it's also

529
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,919
actually audit logs of how often your

530
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,419
employees are logging into the system so

531
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:28,919
they're multiple there are many many

532
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,500
ways of looking at data

533
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,299
um it also has a lot of information

534
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,280
about monetization a lot of this

535
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,780
information that we collect data

536
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,240
collecting technically Amazon and Google

537
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,559
and all these other companies have made

538
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,140
data storage cheaper than it used to be

539
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,880
but it's still expensive there's a

540
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,860
reason why we don't just arbitrarily

541
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,240
delete everything because there's a lot

542
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,700
of good aggregated information that can

543
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,440
help better your products

544
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,480
the rise of data infrastructure data

545
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,039
science machine learning and data

546
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,840
development tool chain will likely

547
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,360
reshape the way we anyway write software

548
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,940
so if data truly is the company's most

549
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,740
sensitive asset how should we go about

550
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,460
protecting it

551
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,380
um in September so September 2020 not

552
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,120
2022 not too long ago there were

553
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,260
multiple companies that had announced

554
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,059
that they had been compromised so let's

555
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,340
actually talk about LastPass since I

556
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,020
think they were one of the few companies

557
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,760
where a breach actually didn't lead to

558
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,220
entire customer data compromise in

559
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,780
lastpasses case they said that they

560
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,340
didn't actually find any evidence of

561
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,020
malicious actors that accessed any

562
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,299
customer data or any encrypted password

563
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,640
vaults and this was because the

564
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,080
developer environment there was

565
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,460
physically separated from the production

566
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,679
environment the developer environment

567
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,960
did not contain any customer data or

568
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,000
actually any encrypted vaults and

569
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,280
finally LastPass employees itself did

570
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,080
not have access to any customers main

571
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,600
passwords so they essentially more or

572
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
less obfuscated this information from

573
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,039
employees which meant that in the case

574
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,900
of a compromise the amount of

575
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,640
information that would actually get

576
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,120
leaked would not dissolve customer trust

577
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,460
in the product as compared to a lot of

578
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,720
other companies where they've gotten

579
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,760
breached and now you have lost very

580
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,320
sensitive private information about

581
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,799
yourself and it's out there in The Ether

582
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
data security is not an easy solution to

583
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,419
start off with there because there are

584
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,640
so many different types of data you need

585
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,960
to have a different approach of trying

586
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,760
to secure them because it you cannot

587
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,039
take away from data usability there

588
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,539
wouldn't be any point of collecting data

589
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,520
if it wasn't usable and security cannot

590
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,260
stop that

591
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,480
so data infrastructure data platform and

592
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,400
data Sciences it's honestly its own

593
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,620
massive space of engineering discipline

594
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,480
you can't expect a security professional

595
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,860
to become an expert in that area

596
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,220
overnight

597
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,320
companies such as AWS Azure or Google

598
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Cloud have started providing a lot of

599
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,220
have have always provided a lot of

600
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,500
storage solutions such as S3 blob cloud

601
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
storage whatever but they're also

602
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,380
providing a lot more security guarantees

603
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,720
in it than they previously have you have

604
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,220
Integrations with companies like data

605
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,500
breaks and Snowflake and then each Cloud

606
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,400
solution will provide you defaults that

607
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
you can go back and configure so they're

608
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,480
giving you the controls but they're

609
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,220
providing you an ability to keep

610
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,200
yourself secure and their infrastructure

611
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,820
if data is secure stored inherently has

612
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,100
less value it means that if it's

613
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,020
compromised if the for whatever reason

614
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,299
the data gets compromised you will have

615
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,799
lesser impact going down to what

616
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,200
LastPass did data anonymization or

617
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,760
pseudo-anonymization differential

618
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,220
privacy anonymity a lot of these sort of

619
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,860
privacy practices actually enable data

620
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,600
security and it's a way a lot of

621
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,100
companies are actually driving data

622
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,140
security

623
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,940
um and then finally adopting a very

624
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,200
similar Philosophy from endpoint

625
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,240
detection it doesn't matter how secure

626
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,340
Your solution is someone will find a

627
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,659
workaround and someone will try to get

628
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,419
access to it so in that case detection

629
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,940
monitoring auditing and alerting has

630
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,860
become critical to capture the out of

631
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,440
ordinary behaviors

632
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,159
um

633
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,500
you need to access two things every

634
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,600
access to user data should always be

635
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,659
audited and audit the types of queries

636
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,159
actually performed and make sure they're

637
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,500
restricted an arbitrary person of the

638
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
company should not have the ability to

639
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,919
Star select all records and then export

640
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,080
that all into like I don't know a CSV or

641
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,059
an Excel and then email them out so you

642
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,440
have an ability to build these types of

643
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,900
detections two forms of detections one

644
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,760
is under the actual data itself and then

645
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,860
one is actual network monitoring what is

646
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,000
the type of data that's leaving your

647
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
company

648
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:26,760
um

649
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,980
Concepts like data ownership data

650
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,080
stewardship are often talked about it

651
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,760
becomes unscalable in a large

652
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,640
organization because most people don't

653
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,500
completely understand what should be the

654
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,200
responsibilities of a data owner a data

655
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,900
generator may not be a data consumer and

656
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,720
may not be a data maintainer these

657
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,340
systems become hard to maintain in the

658
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,780
long run because there is no one point

659
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,760
of failure because multiple it's a

660
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,059
shared resource think of it like a park

661
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,260
if not everyone is responsible for

662
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,140
keeping your Park clean then it becomes

663
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,820
no one's responsibility and then a

664
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,120
public property to a certain extent gets

665
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,860
destroyed because of General lack of

666
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,100
empathy about keeping it clean data is

667
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,960
in a very similar boat it's everyone's

668
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,340
responsibility to make sure it's secure

669
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,220
but if it is insecure

670
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,620
it's no one's real responsibility so how

671
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,659
do you own up to handling an area that

672
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,120
could be so complicated

673
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,460
a data ownership system

674
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,960
the usefulness of a data ownership

675
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,059
system goes much it goes beyond security

676
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,980
it helps tackle questions like data

677
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,840
quality which should technically be

678
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,220
important to a company if they are

679
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,720
making Revenue decisions based off of

680
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,900
that it would be nice to ensure that

681
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,580
security is plugged into those

682
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,080
discussions so right the wave that's

683
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
already happening for a lot of quality

684
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,000
focused decisions

685
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
um finally a lot of these changes are

686
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,820
great for security but they actually

687
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,440
drive a lot of user trust and privacy

688
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,179
and privacy as we know is getting

689
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,919
mandated by a lot more countries than

690
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,020
they previously were so it's always good

691
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,220
to have a bit of a head start than

692
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,659
you've had then at least your

693
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,360
competitors have had

694
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,159
um so moving on to

695
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,780
um the Third change which is distributed

696
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,280
workloads

697
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,140
distributed workloads is interesting for

698
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,120
multiple reasons it's because it

699
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,500
actually reflects the constantly

700
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,940
changing environment that we are in

701
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,860
today

702
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,059
covet has accelerated the move to

703
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,919
multi-cloud so people either have

704
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,600
multiple Cloud environments or they're

705
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,760
stuck between on-prem and off-prem but

706
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,740
cloud computing is past the Tipping

707
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,020
Point in our world and we're going to

708
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,240
see a lot more organizations move their

709
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,919
applications to the cloud in the next

710
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,360
few years than they've historically had

711
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,520
because it was just too difficult to

712
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,159
maintain them on-prem during kobit when

713
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,620
you all can go to work to turn on a

714
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,020
server then what happens

715
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,659
uh most mid to large Enterprises today

716
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,120
use more than one cloud provider and

717
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,679
that's because of reliability issues

718
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,720
Disaster Recovery risk mitigations you

719
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,220
want to minimize dependencies but also

720
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,320
cost if you have multiple vendors you

721
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,179
can always put pit one against the other

722
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,679
to get more money right you want to have

723
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,360
a better contract with all of them

724
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
there are two sites of the coin with a

725
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,799
multi-cloud environment the good is that

726
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,679
most Cloud providers have very robust

727
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,200
security practices in all honesty much

728
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
better than what you would do for your

729
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,559
on-prem Solutions but they are expensive

730
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,480
you can lean on them to provide

731
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,460
infrastructure support because they give

732
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,320
you Baseline end-to-end encryption they

733
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,640
give you really good monitoring and

734
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,720
auditing they give you good Access

735
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,220
Control

736
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,620
the problem however with that is they're

737
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,960
giving you these Solutions it's what you

738
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,179
make do out of it how do you start

739
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,760
figuring out what sorts of SSO

740
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,559
mechanisms or role-based Access Control

741
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,960
mechanisms now exist you have to develop

742
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,640
subject matter expertise not on security

743
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,460
fundamentals but how security Works in

744
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,240
their environment how would you define

745
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,799
role-based access control for all of the

746
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,380
folks who needs to access AWS in your in

747
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,240
your company should people who access

748
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,340
production AWS have the same as staging

749
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,039
AWS should have the same as maybe some

750
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,600
sort of other logging section that you

751
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,419
have for your AWS store

752
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:59,279
um it also becomes a mess of fragmented

753
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,320
tools one thing you'll realize is you

754
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,779
don't have one silver security bullet

755
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,520
that exists you'll have multiple vendors

756
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,900
selling you multiple Point solutions

757
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,000
that in some capacity integrate with

758
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,039
some cloud provider how do you take all

759
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,659
of these arbitrary tools that you've now

760
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,179
deployed and make sense out of them that

761
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,940
also gets very very expensive you need

762
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,500
to now hire someone who not just

763
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,720
understands security but now understands

764
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,520
again security as it pertains to all of

765
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,380
these different tools

766
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,059
um

767
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,860
so my call out here would be be very

768
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,240
mindful when you get into your build

769
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,120
versus buy decisions because you're not

770
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,220
it doesn't make sense for you to buy a

771
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,140
security vendor that's let's say a

772
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,820
series a startup because if they go away

773
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,260
you have made a massive business

774
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,720
commitment on them providing you some

775
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,760
baseline protections it could lead to

776
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,380
you maybe losing compliance certificate

777
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,200
which could lead to you losing business

778
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,480
um so again build versus buy decisions

779
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,559
need to go on your technical

780
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,360
capabilities of actually understanding

781
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,980
what Solutions you're buying and being

782
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,200
able to recreate it in the lack of when

783
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,820
you don't have the ability to actually

784
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,059
continue servicing them and finally cost

785
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,520
cost it becomes very cost prohibitive so

786
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,960
think about how much money you're going

787
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,460
to be using if you deploy this in-house

788
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,020
think about how much money you'll be

789
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,279
spending year over year because it's

790
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,340
probably a service agreement

791
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,200
um another change that I've also noticed

792
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,779
is most services are being Rewritten to

793
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,240
be Cloud native that means the move to

794
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,980
kubernetes or other container Solutions

795
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,440
are going to be faster than before

796
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,640
containers enable speed they enable

797
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,380
portability but they can also create a

798
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,299
lot of security blind spots and they

799
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,500
increase your attack surface because

800
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,299
that's now another thing that you need

801
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,500
to go maintain

802
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,539
unpatched or misconfigured containers

803
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,799
are risks that you previously didn't

804
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,500
have to account for you now have to have

805
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,960
you need to have secure defaults in your

806
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,539
containers kubernetes offer secure

807
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,760
clusters but they are not on by defaults

808
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,200
so how do you now help your

809
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,900
infrastructure organization Define what

810
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,299
your organization risk tolerance looks

811
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,179
like to enable the right defaults for

812
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,559
all of these different infrastructure

813
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,720
tools that you've deployed

814
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,700
your security operations response team

815
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,200
will actually be very very important

816
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,880
here and now they're going to be taking

817
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,320
on a lot more work than they previously

818
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,419
have they're responsible for ensuring

819
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,100
that image scanners deployed to help

820
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,200
identify vulnerabilities in your

821
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,419
containers are actually kept up to date

822
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,279
they're taking into account third-party

823
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,779
dependencies vulnerability management

824
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,600
gets a lot more complicated so when

825
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,460
folks talk about moving to the cloud

826
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,539
because you're getting a lot of

827
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,039
guarantees from your provider that's the

828
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,200
case you are still taking a lot of

829
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,940
responsibility for getting it up and

830
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,980
running for your engineers

831
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,640
um

832
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
traditionally again a lot of people have

833
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,120
expertise doing the entire stack when a

834
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,320
portion of the stack is handled by

835
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,820
someone else how do you scale yourself

836
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,919
to be able to make the right risk

837
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,120
decision on what your gaps look like now

838
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,220
make image scanning and other Security

839
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,080
checks are part of your CI CD pipeline

840
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,279
your continuous integration and

841
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,380
deployment pipeline the sooner you do it

842
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,940
the better because if vulnerabilities

843
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,740
are actually found you're not going to

844
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,120
ever stop a production from happening

845
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
because you found a security build when

846
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,799
you are in the development of your

847
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,200
software so you often a lot of companies

848
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,760
do shift with security risk because

849
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,260
you're like okay it's not a critical bug

850
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,840
it's not immediately the attack Vector

851
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,600
is not immediately obvious let's just go

852
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,100
ahead with it and we will immediately

853
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,860
eventually hot fix it those are very

854
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,659
very expensive decisions so how do you

855
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,700
start front loading and catching a bunch

856
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,960
of these vulnerabilities ahead of time

857
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,880
because of the new technologies that

858
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,440
exist you have the ability to do it you

859
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,700
just need to be aware that you need to

860
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,620
do it now as compared to before where

861
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,520
you probably didn't think about it uh in

862
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,720
all these cases you're trying to get

863
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,340
security feedback as early as possible

864
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,020
in the development life cycle in order

865
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,700
to minimize the security issues from

866
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,140
happening eventually

867
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,700
so

868
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,159
um those were the three changes and I

869
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,600
spoke about briefly my career spoke

870
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,799
about the changes so let's talk about

871
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,480
takeaways what what are the things that

872
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,340
you could probably learn from this

873
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,559
conversation and I'll try to get through

874
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,880
this slides relatively quickly to give

875
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,320
back your morning

876
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,039
um

877
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,559
a lot of this is one of the things to

878
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,059
take away from is these changes are

879
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,559
happening whether you like it or not so

880
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,480
it's best to get on it but also try to

881
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,740
use this to help Define your security

882
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,320
career there's a lot of if you're if

883
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,820
you're interested in financial if you

884
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,320
have Financial motivations or if you

885
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,700
have you want to just be a subject

886
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,440
matter expert in your field the field

887
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,539
itself is changing there's a lot more

888
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,860
money in it than previously was so how

889
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,240
do you take into account a lot of these

890
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,860
things to make the most informed

891
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,480
decision

892
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,159
so the first thing first is take away

893
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,980
one security is moving to Tech and

894
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,220
product development than ever before

895
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,779
security focused on proactive Consulting

896
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,720
secure design pen testing response the

897
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,640
trends have changed and companies are

898
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,559
going further to not just overlay

899
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,320
security as this checkbox it's become a

900
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,820
part of development product lifecycle

901
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,460
and it it should be it's there's a lot

902
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,899
more Focus to it than it otherwise has

903
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,059
been but there's a lot more focus on a

904
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,640
pragmatic way than it has been so

905
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,340
previously if a bug was found somewhere

906
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,380
during sdlc which is software

907
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,700
development life cycle so somewhere

908
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,620
during your life cycle you could then

909
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,600
have a mechanism to eventually patch it

910
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,520
you would go talk to your engineers be

911
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,840
like hey could you patch this then you

912
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,340
would have a risk decision

913
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,320
and eventually it could come out like

914
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,640
hey maybe we should hot fix this or

915
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,500
maybe we shouldn't the problem with a

916
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,179
lot of this is it becomes very very very

917
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,120
expensive the the whole hero phenomena

918
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,980
of security can happen once or twice it

919
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,600
cannot happen predictably and it cannot

920
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,039
happen scalably so you're going to burn

921
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,320
a lot of trust with your internal

922
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
engineering team if you keep doing this

923
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,740
over and over again

924
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,539
security fixes can also be very

925
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,399
intrusive and are notorious for causing

926
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,340
regressions and bad builds because they

927
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,679
often happen in underlying layers so you

928
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,059
need to be a lot more thoughtful about

929
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,820
the types of security fixes to take if

930
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,799
it causes a bad build it means you have

931
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,679
more or less lost customer trust and you

932
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,000
are going to have a very difficult time

933
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,320
having an engineering team take your

934
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,960
picks after this

935
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,700
so everything you believe is secure is

936
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,679
is insecure till someone proves it right

937
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,440
and that's a part of our job

938
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,020
and agile and competitive environment

939
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,580
helps you figure out what your security

940
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,659
bugs are ahead of time

941
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:04,860
we don't have formal release management

942
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,659
schedules anymore because people don't

943
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,100
follow the waterfall model you're not

944
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,720
going to have a specific one week or two

945
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,919
week window where you can test your

946
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,440
product you need to go figure out what

947
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,419
is realistic risk management

948
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,539
uh firstly stack rank your bugs you are

949
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,580
an engineer you're a security engineer a

950
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,200
security program manager you have some

951
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,419
subject matter expertise in security you

952
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,919
should be comfortable enough making a

953
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,480
call of what your critical and high bar

954
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,860
is as compared to what your low and

955
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,260
medium bar is you can punt it over the

956
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,519
fence and have the engineering team

957
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,159
decide to fix all of it you you need to

958
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,019
work very closely with them to make

959
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,820
decisions on okay fixed critical in a

960
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,000
week fix high in a month maybe never fix

961
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,460
median because it's just not important

962
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,980
enough and that is your risk tolerance

963
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,320
help your company Define your risk

964
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,940
tolerance if let's say you're in the

965
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,159
healthcare space right and your medium

966
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,860
bugs could still result in healthcare

967
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,240
information getting leaked then maybe

968
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,159
that your risk tolerance should be a lot

969
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,539
higher and maybe your risk tolerance

970
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,100
should be low bugs don't get fixed not

971
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,799
median you can't expect someone to make

972
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,840
these decisions get involved with how

973
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,760
the product gets developed get involved

974
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,080
in informing what are the bugs that need

975
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,000
to get fixed get involved in informing

976
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,580
how the what your customers should

977
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,260
expect and what the type of security

978
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,820
guarantees your customers should expect

979
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,739
because an engineering team most likely

980
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,659
is not going to be provisioned enough to

981
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,159
be able to make those decisions for

982
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,719
security

983
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,460
the second one is great you you think

984
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,719
you're doing all the right stuff you're

985
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,980
trying to account for risk that's

986
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,399
beautiful uh but let's talk about a very

987
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,020
basic question why should an

988
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,659
organization care about Security will it

989
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,399
help them get more money will it help

990
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,679
them get more customers will it ensure

991
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,820
that your customers are not actually

992
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,879
leaving you it's a very jarring question

993
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,859
to ask at a security conference but that

994
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,780
has been with very organizations I've

995
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,119
worked with and you can't really blame

996
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,500
them for that everyone is in the

997
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,440
business of making money if security is

998
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,140
a cost center be very mindful of how

999
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,900
much cost your cost center actually

1000
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,119
takes in in the amount of money a

1001
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,700
company has allocated you can't you you

1002
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,960
can't come to the drawing board and be

1003
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,339
like security is important we've got to

1004
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,220
fix it how much money is worth it what

1005
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,619
is the return of investment

1006
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,180
um so start with being very practical

1007
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,740
and understanding who your stakeholders

1008
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,200
are and why they care about security if

1009
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,240
they don't care about security why

1010
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,280
should they care about security

1011
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,780
sometimes the right answer could be

1012
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,579
maybe they don't care enough about

1013
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:27,960
security because your customers have

1014
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,660
historically said that they don't care

1015
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,400
um you kind of need to make those

1016
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,079
informed decisions you need to be able

1017
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,640
to articulate that effectively because

1018
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,380
you're creating the security story for

1019
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,820
your company

1020
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,160
constantly ask your audience

1021
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,920
what constantly ask your audience a

1022
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,359
question it's Precision question and

1023
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,220
answering ask them why they should care

1024
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,440
let's say if if a customer comes and

1025
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,940
tells you hey I don't think I care about

1026
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,440
security I want the cheapest solution

1027
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,480
then ask them a bunch of pointed

1028
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,040
questions because

1029
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,140
sometimes maybe they expect certain

1030
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,700
things by default just like you would

1031
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,440
when you buy AWS or Google cloud or

1032
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,060
whatever you expect it by default you're

1033
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,200
not going to pay more for it because

1034
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,220
you're like it should be bundled into

1035
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,859
the product uh the same way is do your

1036
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:09,300
customers actually expect that from your

1037
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,680
product is that why they're not asking

1038
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,720
you like explicit questions about that

1039
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,220
try to minimize the amount of acronyms

1040
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,260
you use only because that makes security

1041
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,660
a lot more intimidating often people are

1042
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,920
actually talking about the same thing

1043
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,500
when you hear the concepts of zero trust

1044
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,320
a shift left or at what's it called a

1045
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,700
least privilege or something of that

1046
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,839
sort it's all about uh preventing

1047
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:34,680
preventing malicious people from

1048
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,020
entering your systems identifying is the

1049
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,240
user who they say they are if you go to

1050
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
an engineering team and be like oh we

1051
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,880
need to go Implement a zero trust model

1052
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,140
they're going to ask you they're

1053
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,560
probably going to ignore you because

1054
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,060
you're spouting Tech jargon that doesn't

1055
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,579
make sense and the barrier of and the

1056
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,440
barrier of them to understand what you

1057
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,480
have to say has increased as a good

1058
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,859
security professional you need to get

1059
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,180
your barrier really really low because

1060
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,099
you need to be approachable security

1061
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,839
needs to be approachable it can't be

1062
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:01,980
intimidating because the more

1063
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,900
intimidating it is honestly the less

1064
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,280
money you're going to get in order to do

1065
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,619
the work that you want to go do

1066
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,540
um don't create an ivory Tower of

1067
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,040
security checklist for your engineering

1068
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,359
team because again you're making it

1069
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,740
intimidating

1070
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,200
you will be implementing solutions that

1071
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,780
will reduce developer velocity you

1072
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,460
should be very upfront about that and

1073
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,839
you should be very upfront about the

1074
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,579
cost so for example

1075
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,960
you don't want everyone in the company

1076
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,119
to access all your customer data you're

1077
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,800
now going to provide it only to explicit

1078
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,359
Engineers or they have to go through a

1079
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,920
system of checks and balances so that

1080
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,900
you know who has accessed what

1081
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,380
you are taking away the concept of data

1082
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,359
ubiquity you're taking away the fact

1083
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,040
that multiple people can now have

1084
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,839
multiple people can access certain

1085
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,720
things it cannot come as a surprise the

1086
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,160
fundamental model that I follow in

1087
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,200
security is no surprises you need to be

1088
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,540
as predictable and boring as possible so

1089
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,119
people know what they're signing up for

1090
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,520
predictability ensures scalability which

1091
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,859
ensures more money

1092
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,380
um more money for your business

1093
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,839
be upfront about the cost of develop

1094
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,280
figure out what your developer velocity

1095
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,320
impedement is going to look like how how

1096
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,280
much slower are you going to make

1097
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,320
Engineers or product managers or data

1098
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,060
science Engineers

1099
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,339
um is it acceptable by the business if

1100
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,140
it isn't acceptable acceptable by the

1101
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,060
business what do you need to do so that

1102
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,740
you can come to your Min bar of

1103
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,060
acceptability but also security

1104
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,220
guarantees

1105
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,200
show how security supports the overall

1106
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,660
business objective understand real risks

1107
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,520
to the company change your metrics to

1108
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,920
accommodate that it's very easy to fall

1109
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
into the Trap of emulating compliance

1110
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,079
checkbox so create a create a security

1111
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,420
checklist that actually enables Security

1112
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,060
in a very measurable way so to give you

1113
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,020
an example

1114
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,599
we fixed 10 critical bugs in the last

1115
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,540
quarter in 30 days we prioritize fixing

1116
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,520
only critical bugs to accept the risk

1117
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,920
for all others due to ABC product

1118
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,839
release what you have done with the

1119
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:56,460
statement is you've explicitly called

1120
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,740
out your risk acceptance bar you've

1121
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,079
clearly shown why your risk acceptance

1122
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,760
bar is to this particular limit because

1123
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,560
we had to go prioritize shipping this

1124
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,599
product and you have been very upfront

1125
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,940
on the fact that this is the data of how

1126
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,940
much we have fixed I mean you can go

1127
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,460
beyond talking about like how many

1128
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,260
Engineers are engineering hours and

1129
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,760
customer risk and money and a lot of

1130
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
these other things but you're trying to

1131
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,359
be as measurable as possible with your

1132
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,800
business and the reason you want to be

1133
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,540
very measurable is performance

1134
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,099
reliability they all follow the same

1135
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,540
model as security

1136
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,220
people assume your service is always

1137
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,839
going to be performant right like if if

1138
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,800
let's say uh

1139
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,000
xyz.com is not reachable you're probably

1140
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,140
not going to do business with that site

1141
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,280
anymore because it doesn't have a few

1142
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,260
milliseconds load time

1143
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,460
um security follows a similar model if

1144
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,780
your customers expect something from you

1145
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,119
the business performance reliability

1146
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,859
again specifically those two help figure

1147
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:51,359
out the right sorts of metrics to talk

1148
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,740
about why people should spend money

1149
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,660
supporting this security should probably

1150
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,000
learn from those businesses

1151
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,040
finally as an industry we don't really

1152
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,200
have a formal path to progress in our

1153
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,900
careers and careers in security are a

1154
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,760
relatively recent occurrence and there

1155
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,160
are a lot more specializations people

1156
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,839
often get exposed to domains or

1157
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,579
subdomains of security through work

1158
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,079
through colleagues through friends

1159
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,599
through mentors through a lot of Discord

1160
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,540
or other slack groups and all of that

1161
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,079
um

1162
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,740
I came across Marco lanchini's mind map

1163
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,839
on various security careers and honestly

1164
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,099
I couldn't have put it any better which

1165
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,380
is why I put it up here there's a link

1166
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,640
to there so please feel free to check it

1167
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,260
out but it actually provides you a very

1168
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,700
good perspective on the breadth of depth

1169
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,720
of security

1170
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,579
it also provides you a perspective about

1171
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,560
the fact that security is not this

1172
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,780
bubble that you actually expect it falls

1173
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,599
under compliance it has a lot of

1174
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,400
correlation with privacy and trust and

1175
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,619
safety it actually has a lot of

1176
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,920
correlation with uh services and

1177
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,540
software development so if you look at

1178
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,040
application security infrastructure

1179
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,520
security uh devsecops Cloud SEC mostly

1180
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,599
if you if you're not a good

1181
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,740
infrastructure engineer you wouldn't

1182
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,000
know how to write security for

1183
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,880
infrastructure so you have fundamentally

1184
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,920
changed the way what you would you would

1185
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,240
you fundamentally change what security

1186
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,220
actually means because it's now getting

1187
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,540
subject matter expertise in different

1188
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,020
stacks

1189
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,920
um there are times when security can get

1190
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,200
really hard and it's very demoralizing

1191
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,880
knowing the fact that you are the one

1192
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,859
making prioritization decisions for a

1193
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,660
company's risk can also be very very

1194
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,460
intimidating and exhausting it's the

1195
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,839
decision fatigue you're constantly

1196
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,640
making these sorts of trade-offs and

1197
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,500
calls off you constantly try to convince

1198
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,760
people why they should or shouldn't care

1199
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,680
about these things and you often do not

1200
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,720
have a safety net what if you make a bad

1201
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,920
call it isn't easy but I think we're all

1202
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,020
here for a reason right I mean it keeps

1203
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,760
us busy it keeps us challenging no pun

1204
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,460
intended it gives us job security

1205
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,020
but it also gives us the joy that at the

1206
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,400
end of the day our users Trust and

1207
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,599
Believe in our product and we're

1208
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,240
shipping good code and yeah thank you

1209
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,380
for giving me this opportunity to

1210
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,540
discuss my thoughts today morning and

1211
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,680
thank you for being present here bright

1212
