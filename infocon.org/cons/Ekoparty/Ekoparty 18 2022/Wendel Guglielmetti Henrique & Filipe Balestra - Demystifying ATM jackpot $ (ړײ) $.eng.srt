[Music] [Music] hello test test can we be fine OK so please on a topic of electronic careers in the other nonablamos spanish then mix of english and also a little mime ok many years i think there are more offensives in several companies than just that  they have part of it there Fortune five hundred also in these sectors of private government etc already learned in Black Hatch theft.com in the United States blah blah blah in Nobre Filipe as Wendel I also worked a long time ago more than 20 years in with researches today  I have a penetration testing company and I wrote some articles a few years ago and we also worked with ATP security. Now we're going to talk a little bit about electronic careers and then we're going to talk a little bit about their part, attacks, etc. good first [Music]  tuesday first let's talk about breaking down what ATM specialists think about TM Security he often  they think that we, researchers, that other people don't have access to ATM, the ATM part to be able to study about it, right, they believe in security by obscurity, they imagine that ATM are very specific technologies and that kind of technology in itself  it just makes the attack more difficult already prevents attacks the protocols they imagine are totally obscure that people don't have the ability to gain access to be able to study or anyway even so there are some protocols that are open and that the system is super safe There are many organized with  security that people can never get around and companies often sell this kind of idea to their customers that they want cashiers, right that ATMs but we see that when you start to study some things about ATMs  we see that most of the time security is very flawed, for example, right? This is a protection that jibo offers  from fixing in Factor very well known atms manufacturer Perhaps the biggest big startup in lobuta and fala Nossa is super safe in the image so is to change the singlebate is in it laison pattern of it torrito you can see can talk in this business is marked highlighted They just change it  the letter O for 097 This is the code that simply manages to sign the pet that makes on the CD on DVD USB to be able to boot in your ATM and they take around a week to return a signed CD to your customer so that's it  it's the kind of protection they do So customers need to send it sends the image and they take a week to return the image signed that way with that code on the internet etc It's not like that, they even break the modules that you can study and many  sometimes you also find yourself fearful selling an auction site Actions sites [Music] in B MercadoLivre you can buy ATM parts to be able to study so this is not  a difficulty and it's not a limitation the atms in general use Microsoft Windows or Linux operating systems, right then the attacks are much more common and it's like attacking a normal Windows from a network in the photograph [ __ ] computer the protocol, you know people say it's difficult to  if you study it and it is used in many ATMs it is documented by an entity so you can get the entire specification of this protocol and it is this specification that we used to also be able to create the Shell code that we will put there to be able to dispense with each one  from them passes all the functionalities for example Stander [Music] commands within this standard the atms also use common solutions of security solutions like White listing and edr antivirus So there are few specific protections for ATM, right some BIOS protections that are only in the specific ones like  for example, it has specific capabilities for ATM even if you can't understand it because we talk a lot please  r we don't guarantee so for a comb test an ATM basically it's an authenticated computer so with some protections but the person gives you an authenticated computer he says like this look here is a computer is logged in it's authenticated and hey it's not possible that you can't do anything  on the authenticated computer, the guy is giving you an authenticated logged-in computer and we have to think about things to be done and on this authenticated computer, right, so the vision of a penteter is that, right, we need to think about alternatives, assuming that this computer is already authenticated that he  it has a high boot that it can have disk encryption but it will have to log in automatically in some way that has a user and password but it will also have a high Lobão So this is basically the ATM and we see that the structure of  ATM is basically the same so we have parts of ATMs where we have a camera this is a small part of hardware but we have the screen which in some cases  os is touch screen and when it's touch screen you need to have the mouse enabled because I'm on the screen it's a mouse so what companies do they take the mouse pointer off the screen so you can't see the tip of the mouse but it's there  There is a card reader there that prevents Spencer and what is interesting to study is that this has connections that are normally USB So you have usb cables connected to the cpubox And these connections are important that we will see in the future and an important interesting point is that the  we basically have two divisions so the part of the rib and Stop Box they call Top Box this part in general does not have much protection it is easy to open up there is not necessarily a part of Barro where there is a place for sometimes this CPU is in  Box but we have the connections up to work So everything needs to have connections to work here we can when they are open very complex Here This big part here these are out basically  It's like drawers it has a whole mechanical series Where you put it there Plata is the one that organizes how many plates there are in this one to choose the plate to send so that you have them receive it from the other side you can see that there are other mechanisms for example  on this Ops good on the other side here for example I still have the CPU there you can even see our connections here on the USB port so several sneakers in a way you are a computer and sneakers on the CPU that we know in others with the known architecture known operating system  and so on specific with the crossbow USB sneakers that have them reused many times even I don't know CPU is in La parte de Barro so in a way it reports this idea of ​​what sneakers in the ATM when it's open if we connect for example if if we  We break the USB cable you connect using hitting PS2 inputs here we can also see a diagram where USB has entered so there are several types of the three is a computer  there is no big difference the temporary ones is a keyboard it is relatively happens in some cases where the keyboard is inside it Electronic track so once the cearela leaves it is top Box it has against it keyboard that board to be able to be operational in some of our case you  there is a restriction on this, for example in others, and we have a test where the series of keys did not lock, so we would have to use the mouse to pick up, for example, a student on the screen, aciel in copying, copying by characters, and pasting to execute commands, it is possible in any of these cases  Ok Ok well our goal is to dispense right jacket So let's talk a little about Cash Spencer it has some protections some don't have any protection it's not mandatory it's not mandatory in some you can just connect the USB cable and send commands to the Cash dispenser and it  accept these commands or and you can put a Live CD in the machine if you have CPU available without any protection [Music] you can  to put a Live CD and also send a command to the Cash dispenser But some There are some protections like in tripédia comunication So we have encryption in communication, right This encryption in communication in communication, we need to exchange keys between the CPU and Cash  dispenser so we need this exchange of Keys between the two to be able to communicate with Quest Spencer and this and this exchange of Keys in some cases you need to prove access to the physical stencil cash to the card money so if you have access to  silver is you you are allowed to be able to provide this key exchange pair a new key so you sometimes have to pull one you have to press some button on spencer's cashier and he understands that you have access to the safe and that it is possible  changing this key there is also another protection that is endue fine cryptography in Brazil we say it is very difficult to be seen and implemented where  and the cryptogram does not come from the CPU but from the authorizer and the CPU is just a Gateway between the authorizer and the Cash dispense so the CPU sends the command makes the withdrawal request upstairs right And up there when authorizing it already simply sends it to the  Cash dispense sends it to the CPU which sends it to Cash Spencer but the CPU doesn't generate the command I don't have the key to generate this command so it's a little more difficult to attack you have a tuned signature because you could try to install old movie versions in the ATM  but you have this subscription to avoid this kind of thing and at the same time it also doesn't let you do roback and install old versions prior to the current version, so this is a type of protection that even we have already circumvented the ncr fit.  possible, this type of protection will pass and install vulnerable versions prior to the most recent version.  now we are all seneramos in the idea of ​​who fears the most both the external part and what is inside let's talk a little bit about it part of the physical attacks like osteristi there first part that maybe you have to attack it physical part was Armando in trying to attack  for example using a touch screen or for example when you need a keyboard that is inside or plugging in a USB etc via Paraíso lagoons options you have to be able to open it from the top part which is the top Box or you have to use something like in the  how do you say drill uh mime uh what is not this injury we will also have in the attack on the question as bypass where you don't need to use Lock picken of Los but traditional ones to be opened by riba detox top Box me in the interesting color is that in Los atms obviously  none of this required by S common in other see sneakers as sensors so for example if someone opens and loatm this is used to send as a communication p  for the central tennis and alarm when it opens in an Unauthorized way So do an I will we will tennis all these things Ah in Los atms and here is what we found in the others and having in the series of ways of attacking here you can see it is relatively common for them  they have a new bold freedom that has this kind of I don't know if that would be a lock this lock that this Spanish student like he loves tubular in English so basically as you can see here it's simple Ok it's just the secret are madness of Los  Pinus that is basic principle in whatever we use in Lock picking etc even many careers with this type of tubular rock in different countries in the world and tennis students who have other types of quiz that are not so common there in Mar render for the tests let-  see me on the left to advance her on the left for example you're a guy who's not like you I don't remember the remute it's been a while since we just brought this test there's like Ochoa like this  this one was by Boyce in the name I'm not mistaken I don't remember it for Laura In fact what we said was na na here it was over there is rock and and using Pink ink for Abelardo Marcaciones when I put it in and when the brands that you understand on  when sia this process Our others were able to identify it correctly and with that biting there that to be in the opening in the others we have some videos for the tees in the others we tried mucho even there organizing and comparing they also understood even freedom from some bank in Argentina to use this  term Liberdade by Unfortunately we didn't get any we tried it was in the extractive here we will have several miles for example this one I believe this old Miriam where you can see just to explain the losssensor issue as they were in Blando for you have a sensor is basically a magnetic contact you  you can see that when it's open it's not green in cases it's without Peter so no  you get turkey in these cases of electronic career ATM we use and really traditional tools that is like this if I eat work on a daily basis there the idea is here is if they placed a small object that will create a small space for others to have a space  small enough for the others to be able to put Magnetic on the Magnetic track so it's not big enough for it to lose contact to the point of activating the alarm So as you can see it was opened in the small space Where are we going with a small piece on the chapita I don't know how  so there's that magnetic part we pull over to answer the contact and from that time on it for example opens it Carreiro without having any problem with alarm sensors and detection you can see that we open it and continues Grimm so this is simply her idea then This  it is one of the points you have to keep these points for when you are going to open in a Carreiro they did not send a signal there centered we tend several  the examples of how was Blando for this example I'm just sorry to show the mechanism that they have in a TM for example using these tubular clefs we use where these tools to create through lock picking When Luan your movement you can see how the movement is totally  mechanic has no way to cross what does not prohibit this type of movement from being that consequently and in these cases where they are implemented In this way we tend to be multius attacks that in others we call bypass attacks for example you do not need Lucky attacks  pica in traditionalisar as in the others we can see that is, you don't need to use it in the tubular Locker you can use this mechanism to open it being in the Clave or something like that as we can see it's Cerrado we are showing in elirium that in this case we will have tubular the Loki I believe in blue  the same ATM model we use the same mechanism to open a slit a little  ueno despacito ATM so that With these pasito in the others we managed to use a small wirele I don't know how it is Spanish in the Lambre that is rigid to touch the mechanism and we managed to open loatm only as bypass the texts can inside the computer we move this type of bypass you  found in different types of ATMs of different models Really, this changes mucho even within the same manufacturer here we have unambari action mechanism is different you can see that it is also Cerrado let's use a mechanism that is not Donald's [Music] mechanisms manages to be this type of  opening that we from other Lamas ask for every specific type etc this type of hunting you see that we create a space we are trying to feel Where are you Punta where and how Mucha gentility are you open about followed by physics to see that it is not something from another world like  we personas also have other protections it is not so simple to open but it is possible for example to  hanging from the lock install a camera that will see where the person enters the password or that works to open the safe we ​​have also managed to make Brooke Force in an irritating safe lock We created a device that read the sound to know if it had worked  or not, right because I'm mute when it works when it opens and when it gives an error and we found a bypass of the penalty so we could make the sound we didn't know when it worked then and there was a bypass in the in the penalty of the wrong password so there are also the questions  of the schemes, right, so these are also things that can be done, they are already known attacks in the vault, there are also options to make small holes, also use the holes that we already have in the lock itself to try in some cases, for example, to authenticate the cash  from Spencer and being able to send commands to the previous Cash dispense will not allow time so as we mentioned there is an authentication right from Cash Spen  cer and when you have something there are some authentication options So you have boxes without authentication as we commented back there, even to skip this slide but we simply send commands via USB directly to Cash Spencer or use a buttonable image Cash dispense  that has authentication how it works we explained that he needs to tap finally prove that he has access to the safe, right the Safe box and that's it there are ways to try to circumvent it like for example with a hole, it's not even without opening I always box to try to do it  circumvent generating a new authentication to generate a new key and with that key if possible to communicate with the dispensing box it sends the dispensing command also in some cases if it has access to the CPU it is possible to make some attacks that we will even comment here for  front that it is possible to recover the authentication key between the CPU and the cash dispenser then recover it in memory for example and use this key to pod  er send commands directly to the Cash dispenser so you can come here let's talk a little bit so as we talk about the times in the others we have the problems that are of xfs that are how do you say the standard the protocol that is used in Communication let's go there a little bit  more of this through the ATM through the ATM also understands that connecting with other other Parties as a communication through its network as it does not fit or on the wireless network etc for example what he We love about authorizing the authorization server is this is this one here for example  this computer that is a network communication that says, for example, electronic Tennis Plata between account its Like, for example, it takes 50 thousand people all in the communication to be this and in this communication it also follows in the nose or at least it should not all places implement the same  ISO peru the communication but it is encrypted or at least it should be encrypted in all cases by Multilaser in the other bimos  communication because it was not encrypted some ATM systems the Carreiros are not Kennedy back at least what in the others We saw that this one changes in it In most of them clients frequently so for example you do not call and apply in the quick update in, for example 500 thousand careers in  a whole country I am takes time etc testing mucho so they a slow process So in this one as a cradle for example outdated cryptographic libraries algorithms that are not secure and things like that  for example symmetrical in this case of lasymmetrical it is relatively common that where our other We saw that it is not among the places that I washed here the ones used for this communication well in the image that we were the band maybe for terrida with the delíbal solution of then there Clave is in this  if you don't remember me i think it was AES Clara forgot to use it  it was the same entoloz careers across this country so for example when you have to compromise one of these Claras one of these Quiz you could intercept them communications from any career in all countries and this Clave is not even modified so for example it is not  that's what you have to compromise in the TM, you can instrument it communication in all and the BIOS also in the implementations that don't have when it's this symmetric SSL peeling so for example now it's uploading a fake server I don't know how to make this to be like an attack demand indemido  Self signed Elo7 certificate and in that case it is completely disabling these a true example also of a test that in the others we say behind this career It is in that R when the R has in the functionality that they implemented inside it as if it were an administrative law way of where there  Persona puts like in Clave and tennis rents some features that I feared available in this case was of  enable encryption you can see that in these L enable ethnicity the possibility of disabling in this specific case you can think of several attacks like on camera when a skimmer to catch the Clave etc or even being like nataque de bruther as in the others we commented once  that the accesses manage to disable them in SSL in this case and then there communication as the times of a communication that is sen in this case only communication changes how it would be they adapt sneakers in the binary part in the part that is purely text the part that cannot see that it is  how do you say in english huh this for example the number of tarreta then you are a number of tarreta like decree So it starts to kick straight for everla validity all this data goes through the communication so you can connect sorry to capture various other information such as date which  the value that you would like the TT not even to know the communication having in the sequence You are not a single packet only in one  series of tennis packages as identifiers that open John depending on the previous package this packages used in this specific case to generate the next package and etc but the speaker is important is not so different from there idea of ​​loexpf within your career when you saw there  photographs must be remember that something big and those things have as if they were cars that in others we can remove they are big where they teambrem them and put La Plata each of these plots the times a type of plate for example you can for dollar You can put Argentine pesos  of this applies what to choose what to choose and also what type of banknotes for example What type of banknotes then for example in this one in this Box in the others only the platform mini prices in The other let's put for example with 500 thousand pesos and things like that in  another one has 10 dollars and all this happens in La Comunicação so for example when I ost there and say I want to be withdrol that I also don't know how mobile  español como Retiro Gracias Ok only when you beat a hero uh the texts I want to get like 10 dollars and in this case Ok no like I said you're not mandated binary protocol students Fields that start for example know that there are four careers are four or five usually I don't  remember I believe this was four so there would be four cars as if it were a 12b or 13c car and in each lane marked for example I came there communication the number that described how many ballots should be obtained from each one so for example your request 10 tenia  to go back for example the market only in the first Box for its have to modify if it communication could to the air give me five of it first Box three of it second to Box is so on economist to take multi- some plants it so much that it would be registered in it bank it would be  I'm just sorry for the 10 bucks I think you're a little abstract so others have a video to explain it you can see it being due it's not on the ex  tra strong because they are very mallo in the crap I don't know if it opens there without spanish or by esmallow Malo here our other we cinemamos an electronic Carreiro Liberdade was looking at the laboratory we will have someone who is simulating him client Let's go down like this this Persona has a credit card that is true  and put your credit career within career and start in the process for example please do not remove you are straight blah blah blah we are validating entert continue let's continue etc now ponga do Clave like one two three four that the bags then ask if you want to drink  how much to answer money or get for example from [Music] And then or even part of that processing was being processed this communication through there Bueno network this as the request to withdraw is to withdraw 10 dollars and we can see these banknotes in the same enlurecibo  they are not Freedom when we have this type of test they are all having the mark coming down which is speech  for the temporary 10 TV we are very good a video condition I can hear now life edition in this troforte now let's remove it please instrumentation you can see that there is num num errei route 45 nstr route 45 basically we are doing in the attack of Maine The Middle in La communication  as we mentioned and we are an attack breaking ah there cryptography when we ah with the information that we hablamos before and after doing there instrumentation is simply itself we identify in the format and we will replace the information in transit time as we explained So let's go again to black we want for  example to be a Niro of 10 dollars exactly by the same procedure you can see that there are no cuts nothing like this Ah he for you screw these beaconing asks you to remove get it again by the communication happens in Laje de etc and then this communication obviously not bar chat  with a complaint from Spencer etc and now our others we can see that  and in ourselves a lot of these dollars and to show you we have D5 BBS The Beatles So you taught the others we instrumented a communication quoting these bits to make the changes to receive a card from different ATM Box inside enlou I get to see the same as 10  ok ok start using it is done it was created by you and it is not from i believe in spanish basically in the european standardization entity europen comich stander in the abstraction layer several hardware devices and in the natm without having to know the implementation of each one of them if you don't  you would have to know, for example, how to work with each chair device and see each printer and so on it is not mandatory due to the common smoot we see in practically all clients I believe that until today it was implemented and they were implemented in a Windows environment through  a DL that the well-known MS hype is that this is the point dll So when you love this protocol there are not many secrets  do it's just for example wfs Startup where God has initializes loffse FS Manager then a se for example ahn wfs opense from where I'm wrong where he opens lolódulo that I'm changing from ATM to ATM and then sends for example in the other apis in the commands like wfs Execute  this receipt in the infinity of commands most common link S lofsc cmdc MD dispenses that eloacean Wick draw as jackpot here you have in the very small specific part of the specification that is only regret is about this command has structure there you are how to program for Windows for him  marapeí this is not a big secret so the objective was for us to also show that it is possible to have common attacks on ATM, right to be able to gain access and execute the communication using xfs protocol, right, so the atms have a network communication with several programs some  atms use for example Firefox Chrome to be able to have the authorizer communication other atms use several programs like MQ and I go to  show a Farm MQ and all that we managed to sniff out an ATM communication capture and we can make an attack there in Side because we have access to the network, right?  answer right so we, for example, did one of the ones that we explored for a long time, right in several Athens that use they use IBM's MQ to be able to have messages and We found a flaw in Mickey's klight, in fact we found more than 20 flaws in MQ and  we created a tool for this to find the purposes in klight, you know, nobody cares who cares about the MQ client, a failure of this type has no value. However, for an ATM that has the client generating an automatic communication, it is very important then  one of the vulnerabilities we found was in MQ clight, right, there's even a description, it was when we changed a response from the Server, we changed it to  the for the MQ emqr Play and what to have waited right And that then there was an overflow and we managed to write interesting regions in the memory to explore a normal over Flow a buffer Flow as if it were a normal client a client leaves the attack this works for several  other things, right, so several other programs can be exploited, for example, a vulnerability in Chrome, right, public that sometimes are not updated ATM are difficult to update in some cases they are outside the browser network like Chrome because it is not more common  in others we have already opened clients that implement every part such as the communication where this is in the web application and this Communication in the web then as it is a browser and then this having other layers that it opens when it has so we are common to take our  the other day we saw these little packages and I think that in the others we don't have more time am I correct or can we talk for another 20 minutes yes or no  just a short 5 minutes how to attack in Windows normal in Linux it is not possible to attack the network or the network protocol some atms use right management via control man Via Microsoft network via control management software to handle remotely that we finally have  managed to create something also a little different from the standard not only in relation to the attack on the service, right, but the atms in general have disk encryption to be able to protect the access an infection, once an attacker has access to the Top Box, he has access to the CPU, right  but these disk encryptions in general, they need to initialize automatically, right?  TPM is often not available, some manufacturers even do not give access to the TPM to their customers because they have a key and do not  let no one have access to the TPM right and We created one of the ways that we found to circumvent disk encryption using virtualization so once we have access to the Top box and the CPU or we have a connection to the CPU via USB we  we can try to put a Live CD that will allow us to virtualize the ATM disk the hard drive the physical disk and we virtualize this disk and as we are in the HOST we can read all the memory of our gast virtual machine or write or write  so, for example, we can look for the encryption key for communication with Cash Spencer, right? We can list all the processes in memory. We can write processes in memory that we showed back there, who will think.  exé by an executable of her entire memory that I showed to be for example as volatilite then any Attack on the tepoleon for example look for a chain of stainless steel and d  then use this when entrepointing to recruit command you can simply replace replace in a chain of nops by a shell code of yours and this shampoo of hopefully for example will be executed in the specific application Barro operated this possibility and in this case if we simply remove the  randall32 executable in this case and we leave only the directory when the machine tries to call this one we run it, we make a pack and when the machine tries to call it in this case it will open an explorer for us, right then it will open the windows explorer will give access to windows  Explorer that will allow Navigating through directories through files
