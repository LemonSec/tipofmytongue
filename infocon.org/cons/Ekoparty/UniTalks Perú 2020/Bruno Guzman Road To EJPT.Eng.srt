 little about their experience people about the process to obtain the

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,899
 hudson certifications of e-learning security do not and address some topics like

10
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,350
 the structure the preparation course contents laboratories the

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,400
 basic knowledge required to take the course the tools you have

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,480
 used and the certification exam procedure from your point of view

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,190
 personal and good without more to say bruno I give you a welcome pass

14

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,650
 Already ready for sarkozy thank you very much for the invitation

16
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,120
 my name is good guzman comedians jon clear

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,230
 I am everything they already mentioned and today I go

18
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,149
 to talk about what it is in a personal way to obtain a

19
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:39,439
 of the certifications and what it means to have a certification in your

20
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,990
 labor field or only in the field of study that you want

21
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,789
 It was a bit of what I was already presented with

22
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,729
 again I repeat I am a little they have me down believe

23
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:09,430
 in this, you security is analyzed in the information security department

24
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:16,500
 of the information from sbs for having a research group from my university

25
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,820
 directed more than the entire it safety and management network from you too

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,400
 of senabre nor triple in you I am passionate in insecurity because already

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,569
 is the funniest thing you could say

28
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,890
 You can find me on twitter with those who are registered

29
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:42,630
 and now now, going to the important parts of the content of this talk

30
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,310
 it will be four points because a certification we will

31
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,129
 explain why it is important to obtain some certification in any field

32
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,859
 what we are involved in later I will explain what it is for

33
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,400
 what did i choose as my first certification lj petter

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,530
 then we are going to enter the world of practical knowledge in which we

35
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,500
 it would help us that it would serve us in our day to day and

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,069
 at the end he returns some recommendations on how not so much in the course as

37
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,660
 in life at the time of giving in this type of

38
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,680
 of insecurity items now because the certification

39
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,750
 and certifications are very important because they help you to demonstrate

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,829
 your abilities both at work at the time of making a

41
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:49,840
 homework and also very good requirement in the

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,840
 world in the field of employment issues or also entrepreneurship since as

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,890
 when a young woman going to college has no work experience

44
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:06,670
 You have no way of sustaining that you know something that you worked in the field in which you are

45
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:15,629
 postulating the most important thing or what it is that can validate us

46
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,680
 our knowledge is the certifications as I already mentioned in

47
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,699
 this part of the certifications can be in any field can be in

48
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,419
 networks can be security force in efficient and webs etc.

49
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,969
 certifications when you are young recently graduated the most important thing is to

50
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,500
 demonstrate your capabilities and certifications are one of them are one

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,090
 important part

52
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,610
 now entering a little more to the practical certifications of security

53
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,100
 These certifications measure more than your entire level of ability and your level of

54
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,960
 to be able to face one is to have a real scenario

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:02,359
 both test your knowledge and how to solve problems is

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,710
 a real realm

57
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,500
 to pass a bit what is issues of practical certifications in security to

58
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,760
 what I know to what I know there are two certified company teachers who give

59
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,650
 certifications whose exams you have to take

60
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,860
 then you can say a zinc bridge in the case of teaching security

61
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:38,629
 to what I know to what I know about my friends who took an application from fsp etcetera or

62
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:44,120
 friends security is more focused on a practical exam of the ctf mode where

63
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,770
 you can take a flash capture

64
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,979
 to do the objectives that the pnc security gives you

65
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:01,699
 jpt belongs to leader security and this exam is more than an exam where

66
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:07,369
 We give you the scene of a small network and you have to bridge this at all

67
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:12,169
 more is a real scenario you have to do the steps that should be followed

68
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:18,080
 on a bridge without normal everything they teach you or everything you might know about

69
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,889
 it necessarily has to be applied and in the exam

70
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,460
 now

71
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,020
 You can see a bit of the certifications it has

72
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,430
 offers security both on the web for both applications

73
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:44,340
 both for infrastructure etc. the same with

74
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,299
 and the same with

75
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:55,260
 with those of lippi in the xxi it has many simplifications and courses

76
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,710
 you can quickly see to explain what they are in red

77
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,330
 are those that are oriented to offensive security and those that are in

78
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,919
 blue are the ones that are defensive security oriented

79
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,910
 because a little more of the verifications to which I went

80
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,710
 jpt s offensive part

81
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,600
 but there is a certification of 6 and speaking a little to say is that it is

82
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,480
 too well known in the workplace and in the market

83
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,500
 well done recently good a couple of years ago

84
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,720
 Ultima in Europe got its practical certifications which is also

85
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,449
 ctf mode

86
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,909
 you have to develop all levels you have to do what the

87
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:56,360
 laboratory in the part of what is certifications in fact has to be

88
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,780
 as I say the practice and that of knowledge when all

89
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,909
 They have these two certifications that give another certification that is called thus age

90
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:16,160
 master is that new modality was recently applied as well

91
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,780
 and now a little about theoretical certifications

92
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,909
 in security [Music]

93
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:31,760
 Trust certifications are certifications mostly based on

94
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,270
 theory and can see everything the account is

95
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,199
 this company

96
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,599
 now we have other beings for example that

97
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:55,389
 in the courses many may come that have to see some laboratories

98
00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:02,550
 etc. but the exams to obtain the certifications are

99
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,260
 the days

100
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:53,569
 They already had excuse me and this is to put the applications scenes

101
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:59,449
 and drops that also have their exams are theoretical but from resources that come

102
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,990
 laboratories

103
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,730
 already touching the whole topic of notifications I showed you a little the

104
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,310
 applications that you in the field of security either safe offensive

105
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,209
 defensive practical applications of theoretical scores

106
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:23,248
 now I'm going to tell you why

107
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,170
 and I decided to enter the world from afar I feel like

108
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,269
 so that all this from far away was born by certain recommendations of

109
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,990
 friends I also saw some experiences about

110
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,540
 this certification of people and having on twitter on facebook

111
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,310
 google / youtube etc. in strong on linkedin

112
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:57,250
 I saw the course content and still the basics

113
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,209
 and explained it to you in such an easy way that

114
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:08,739
 you could understand as soon as you give the first law dadt and the

115
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,300
 price is really accessible to do a basic course the price is really

116
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,930
 accessible

117
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,430
 but we are going to enter a little into the world of practical knowledge that I'm going to him

118
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:28,079
 mention, I'm going to let you know what it is to do

119
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,990
 a certification take a course where they teach you

120
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,629
 do things by putting your hand as you might say

121
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,510
 good when you analyze the course always when you start any course because in

122
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:53,220
 course you always have to have the mentality that you have to put all

123
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,420
 the possible force all the possible attention to the course because because if it is that

124
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,370
 You do not know something, nothing costs you and ordered to review your

125
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,970
 material etc. you have to be attentive you have to be aware of

126
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,800
 these things in whatever course you get in whatever

127
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,040
 Investigate you should always give it dedication

128
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,079
 the important thing about all this is to do it in laboratories that give you is good

129
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:28,089
 doing the practical part so that it stays in your memory is not only reading

130
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:35,220
 but also start it up and more than all

131
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:43,130
 this this from the explanations many many times all the material is

132
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:51,600
 found is hacked on the net question bank can you find a

133
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,860
 endless information about the certifications that one would like

134
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:06,990
 take in this case of money something that I know to my knowledge is that

135
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:13,050
 there is very little information about what is done within the exams has to

136
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:19,410
 being able to steal there may be is because there are some tips they give you but say

137
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:25,880
 if it's you against the world to perform the final test

138
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:32,430
 now a bit of the content of the course that I was commenting on the

139
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,790
 especially what you are going to learn within the course you can read many things

140
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,649
 that come to you, for example, play the subject backwards so roughly they touch the subject

141
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:48,290
 networks touch issue depends without infrastructure and touch issues of

142
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:56,060
 web dependency web applications that means that the course is evoked

143
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,329
 mainly to give you that little push that if you want

144
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,980
 go to the web part or if you want to go to the infrastructure part in

145
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,390
 dependency that's why they teach you all that they teach you

146
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,060
 all the basics to be able to carry out certain attacks to carry out being true

147
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,660
 this to use the methodology at the time of

148
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,829
 carry out a test plan they teach you attacks they teach you they teach you

149
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,680
 sports want countless things that you can apply them to day-to-day

150
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,839
 in this in your field of work

151
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:42,780
 a little about the laboratories as I already mentioned this course or this thing from the

152
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:49,260
 jpt has several laboratories for each

153
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,710
 one of the two of the subjects will always come 123 laboratories in which

154
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:02,820
 you can do them without anyone bothering you because the laboratories go by

155
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,100
 bp n if that scenario is only controlled by you

156
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,510
 all this is good because apart from that yes

157
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,870
 a document where they show you the laboratory that has to be carried out and

158
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,730
 apart from laboratories, there are challenges to measure your capabilities when not

159
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:33,230
 you can solve a laboratory gives you the possibility

160
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,920
 to be able to read the resolution because within the document is the resolution

161
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,019
 except with the challenges in the challenges and you are worth yourself this will

162
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,690
 streamlines more than anything in your analysis capabilities at the time of having a

163
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:57,790
 scenario x gives you a scenario and it is to perform the steps that

164
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,270
 did you learn

165
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:09,499
 and being able to obtain a favorable result has its scenario go and what

166
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:15,840
 same so if they don't know something

167
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,900
 they can go to their google they can go to the materials they give them can go to the

168
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,620
 videos and can solve labs

169
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:37,089
 within all this within the entire course or within the jp tea

170
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:45,009
 you will always think but what tool do I use what things should I use like

171
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:51,430
 I must follow what step to do here they explain the use of tools

172
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:59,290
 basic in the realizes depends on if for example they can read the n mauer know

173
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,119
 floyd msf come although it is a contribution of explore

174
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:13,260
 they teach you to carry out network attacks a bit of routing switching etc.

175
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,760
 and all this is important because if this is used on a day-to-day basis

176
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,410
 for example wireshark you use it to capture packets to be able to do by

177
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:30,020
 example man-in-the-middle attacks what is gets exploit you can use it to

178
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,300
 look for a known example of a vulnerability within a port of a

179
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,350
 application etc.

180
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:46,010
 sql map is the most classic to use for sql injection

181
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:52,879
 where you can compromise the database and pull credentials get

182
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,460
 accesses etc. within everything you learn you are going to learn to use

183
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,000
 tools and most of all these tools are

184
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,330
 street-based on linux is a pretty good linux distro and what

185
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:21,189
 If I give you one piece of advice, it is that you learn the basics little by little.

186
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:27,220
 little in what is linux because linux is the basis of all the

187
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,740
 security part well you can use windows for certain things but inside

188
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,330
 of your day to day in the pentes part and in the computer security part in

189
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:44,020
 the part of d I do not know malware analysis etc. this link will always be used or

190
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,940
 some linux distributions will always be made

191
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,720
 since I told you a little about what the tools are, here are some

192
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,640
 examples of what you are going to see in the course this is an example of a

193
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,929
 scan using enema as already explained by others is from one of the

194
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:10,110
 speakers enemas serves to list open bodies services etc.

195
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,510
 there you can see a command where we are going to see with this command you can see the

196
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,590
 service names

197
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,129
 to see if the thing is open no longer ask it again

198
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,200
 and move to later get a little more information about what is

199
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,130
 doing the scan and it points to an ip or a set

200
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,890
 they can see a list of open ports and with that list of open ports

201
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:49,340
 We begin what is the scanning phase scanner to port within the course you

202
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,110
 They are going to teach what is the dependency phase from information greater

203
00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:00,469
 link scan vulnerability analysis what is the exploitation of

204
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,809
 vulnerabilities and to get a session

205
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:14,639
 within the objective continuing here you can see a list of ports and you

206
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:20,039
 teach how to analyze these ports for example in zoom is the

207
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:30,600
 port 21 which is an ftp port and the version is bs ftp 2.3.4 which is the

208
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,340
 information we can search in google search in bases

209
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:43,370
 of data search in pages where you show yourself

210
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:50,090
 vulnerabilities associated with services and in this case

211
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,240
 we are going to use a little what is put exploit in mete exploit if that is

212
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:04,630
 we open the mt floyd application there is a command that allows us to search

213
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,850
 and exploits for certain types of technologies in

214
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:17,149
 this case in the first in the first red box you can see a

215
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,900
 search http which is the initial name of the service

216
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,580
 and we give center and it will list all those blogs

217
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,120
 the flowers that can be used to violate this type of service in this

218
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:43,489
 case shows us one of them which is the exploit

219
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,989
 based on unix that we can use to be able to obtain a

220
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:55,470
 access since we have this information is missing

221
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,500
 list the other bodies once you have the list of all ports

222
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,650
 You go to the part of checking if this vulnerability exists, we continue with

223
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:14,529
 what is the bc ftp inside the exploit we put a command

224
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:21,820
 that just and the exploit address and then we do a show jones to see

225
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,399
 how they work what parameters the exploit needs to work

226
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:36,059
 in this case you only need a rejón which is the play pe where you are going to attack

227
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:41,350
 a report that comes by default which is the port

228
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:49,158
 21 associated with the ftp service and once we make all this sense

229
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,980
 We give it exploit and once and once we give it exploits we will be able to

230
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,900
 check if the vulnerability itself exists

231
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:07,549
 or not in this case it was possible to obtain an access with the root accounts

232
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:11,230
 to the ftp server

233
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:15,549
 we can do a ls command

234
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:23,230
 and give enter and under the ls command there will not be all those

235
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,560
 all those directories all those all those files that

236
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:34,350
 contains this this server in this case we can

237
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:40,860
 affirm that the exploitation of the service the exploitation of the vulnerability was

238
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,500
 successful every time one performs this is these steps

239
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,580
 you have to capture evidence of what is being done in order to

240
00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:00,570
 then pass it on to a report because within the world within the world

241
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:08,490
 It depends on whether it does not matter how much that both now yes as

242
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:14,970
 you got a user in root you could say in this case if not what matters

243
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:22,170
 to the client or what matters to whom you contract that is how you did it why

244
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,960
 because this will help a lot the remediation part of the part

245
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,590
 that of contract so in this part in these cases

246
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,620
 they must be well ordered that was a bit of infrastructure

247
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,260
 now after that of listing our port of listing our defects we can

248
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:50,658
 appear an ip that has an active web service

249
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:56,400
 For example, imagine that I have already done all the scanning of

250
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:05,380
 enemas I found a port 80 open I tried it and it redirects me still to a page

251
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,429
 opening from the browser in this case

252
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:14,679
 They also teach you to test a skill manually, it is not only to use

253
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:25,480
 a tool one has to know where to look to know where to put such

254
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,460
 parameter know how to give a give a view to the

255
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:38,909
 application to know how it works in this case we have this view

256
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,120
 where in the part

257
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,710
 in this part

258
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:58,559
 in the url of all requests from this system

259
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,629
 we can put a simple food to check if it is sql susceptible

260
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:09,748
 injection because because this simple food can make it can generate a

261
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:16,320
 error within the database manager and as this error one can know

262
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,168
 if it is that if it is vulnerable or not

263
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:30,169
 to this type of attacks this is a simple example of attacks

264
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,550
 1 learn there are different types of attacks

265
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,720
 in different types of technology in different types of database managers

266
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,230
 data and hours passing we can here obtain a

267
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,920
 alert

268
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,880
 and thanks to this alert we can know what type d

269
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,150
 database manager is using the bicycle

270
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:04,330
 etcetera etcetera etcetera etcetera thanks to this type of alerts one can

271
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:11,699
 already use a tool

272
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,539
 to be able to carry out the attack in this case

273
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:31,900
 we have the sql map where we can put sql map point p

274
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:40,890
 - its the url that you were making vulnerable

275
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,549
 put some more parameters for example the type of database if

276
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:54,450
 we want to create the database and so on

277
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,720
 here we have

278
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:08,299
 the code that we have inserted to be able to code the problem that advance

279
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,360
 we have the vulnerable web where the

280
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:24,179
 the vulnerability we are going to say that it aims only to review

281
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,650
 the code and not the action because here was the error at the time of review

282
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:34,740
 a simple meal and let's say list us in the database once

283
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,190
 done give enter ls coleman is going to be a

284
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:46,279
 instructional attempt will pass different types of

285
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,309
 of frei those associated with attacks that sneak in

286
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:58,149
 and after that we do have a successful instruction in this case we

287
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:03,879
 the database lists the database that this application has

288
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:08,379
 and already in the database we can use other commands to see tables to see

289
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,549
 columns etc.

290
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:18,290
 for example here a list of passwords was found

291
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:23,970
 associates x users

292
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,770
 and once this type of passwords is obtained

293
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:45,850
 let's try until we get that [Music]

294
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:52,870
 that user who has higher privileges in this case got privileges

295
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:58,159
 administrator with this type of attack is very

296
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:04,160
 important as I say, first test the where the parameter is located

297
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,430
 vulnerable parameters in any type of vulnerability and that is why it has just recently

298
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:17,060
 go to the use of tools because many times there are attacks that are manually

299
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:24,639
 they are going to complicate too much that it is better to use tools

300
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,330
 automatic to curl these attacks that does not mean these tools do not

301
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,100
 they are going to do all the work but we have to put our hands first

302
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,320
 similar tool what to do

303
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,780
 and what they have to focus on

304
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,340
 a bit of the exam that is going to take the exam of these

305
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,090
 type of certification is 72 hours have three days to be able to carry out

306
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,080
 the whole stage

307
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,168
 certain questions

308
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,600
 that you want to answer everything is based on a real scenario all these

309
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,939
 they went to dinner at the real you have to be focused on this you have to

310
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,590
 do it in a sequential way following all the steps in front

311
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:26,418
 without normal and you're really going to have fun at this

312
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:34,059
 some recommendations both in the exam part and in part d

313
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:40,000
 of the daily life that one is going to have in this when entering

314
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,720
 in this field of security it is important to always be self-taught

315
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,830
 the courses that many you can take

316
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:02,030
 They can give you a lot of information but one should not be left alone with this

317
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:07,559
 information but go looking for more and more knowledge

318
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,330
 as I said they must always be ordered must see

319
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:20,050
 they have to have a vision of a real world all this is learning

320
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:26,770
 continuous continuous and must always put all the necessary forces to stop

321
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,580
 be able to perform any action within the time of performing

322
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,580
 a test or they will say vulnerabilities etc.

323
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,990
 and that would be the most important thing of all, you are having fun because if you

324
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:48,929
 you really stress, one knows what it is to have fun in every area that he did in

325
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:55,710
 every field or in whatever you do you should have fun so that's

326
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:02,190
 it would be all about my experience with what is the part of taking a course by

327
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,330
 a practical certification

328
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,559
 and what this influences in our work life or in our life

329
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,710
 professional in our personal life thank you very much

330
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,630
 thank you thank you for a very interesting one, your experience only

331
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:24,570
 to end up believing we have a lot of time left they were asking what environments

332
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,720
 more windows linux are played and how many of each

333
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,330
 then it touches us more the environments that are used within this

334
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:46,080
 world are the two sincerely when they teach you what it is

335
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,419
 Infrastructure testing teaches you so much look

336
00:33:51,420 --> 00:34:00,110
 to put windows and they will return linux they also teach you on web servers

337
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:08,399
 both there is like Apache etc. there is not a distinction in itself that of

338
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,418
 what technology is used because it has to learn both necessarily

339
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,969
 another query to finish what do you think of the box hack and if

340
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:24,219
 you consider important to start in this area

341
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:32,099
 for my part he has not touched much I know that he is a

342
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:38,679
 seven-axis stage but it's nice to also be able to make our own

343
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,010
 laboratories building our own virtual machines

344
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:49,340
 and doing our scenarios anda box is a scenario more than everything for

345
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,409
 make you efe to be able to get some flash etc. is good because it helps you

346
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,790
 to reason helps you skin

347
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:09,210
 in front of the part that not only letter box is going to be the daily life

348
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:16,450
 daily life is more than an environment based on reality where

349
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,819
 you can have in machines where you have to do a

350
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,660
 an east

351
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:36,730
 hello I think the audio is gone

352
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,720
 Hello

353
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,580
 2 hello hello

354
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,900
 now great I told them that heart the box helps them more than anything to tune their

355
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,060
 super section of the world and how to troubleshoot but it's a good

356
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,810
 tool for that

357
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:14,180
 and that's it, thank you very much, I don't know if we can take a walk for what

358
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,410
 we can do the contest

359
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,960
 Thank you very much for one that thank you very much thank you very much to all

360
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,920
 organizers sincerely
