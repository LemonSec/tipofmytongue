1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Let's start with Rafael Guzmán Rafael is a person I know from

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,678
 some time ago and I have seen how it has progressed from having a lot of interest

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,320
 in this subject until becoming an expert today doing work of

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,710
 cybersecurity security in the field the issue of hacking the issue of

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,039
 security fence iba and the issue of defending have been two things that always

6
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,730
 have interested him and in which he finds much value for the

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,590
 organizations so that they can defend themselves against those who commit crimes against

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,680
 through computer security or insecurity he is going to talk about the

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,840
 implementation of a port by tim here we can see the issue of obtaining a port

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,660
 by tim as the combination of rating and a blue team if not exactly known

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,010
 what is each one precisely that is also part of what rafa is going to have

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,550
 Please explain now and how all this benefits in a work integrated to

13
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,729
 the organizations that is the short presentation so that

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:15,670
 They can have more time with Rafael and Rafael there I'll leave you with all the people

15
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,939
 hello don't listen perfect

16
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,500
 first good morning that latin america I am going to present implementing by bertín

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,560
 we start with the disclaimer of digital material from

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,130
 This presentation and the time exposed is intended to provide

19
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,780
 only information therefore to apply all this knowledge you have to

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,830
 have a contract in accordance with the law not to perform for this entity but

21
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,679
 reptile the information that is going to be exposed here

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,830
 represents solely in my opinion and my experience therefore does not represent

23
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,658
 no official position of any partner organization

24
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:02,200
 who am i reserved the medina peruvian self taught start this learning by

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,359
 my account and study this the technical career of computer science and go to study

26
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,929
 systems engineering and I am a specialist in offensive security and

27
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:18,099
 defensive regarding certifications or se the lcsp ce and other

28
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:23,018
 my experience well I have put more than 12 hours a day is something that I like I

29
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:29,110
 passionate I leaned jmr rioja and a phrase that I always use in any

30
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,680
 type of publication or article that I do is the knowledge makes you free and you

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,110
 prepare not to lose to cybercriminals

32
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,010
 let's start with the terms hackers the hacker is the person

33
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,519
 passionate about research and self-improvement committed to the

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,540
 learning to improve your skills and knowledge thus hacking

35
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,519
 it's just a historically hack lifestyle comes from him

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,140
 term that was used in the 1960s and 1970s when technicians

37
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,750
 telephone terminals were fixed with small knocks

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,280
 we pass to the term of cybercriminals cybercriminals any person who accesses

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,670
 without authorization to a network so that in order to commit illegal acts and your crack

40
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,640
 comes to mean breaking

41
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,269
 as we see here we have the threats they will excuse because I am going to run because

42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,760
 I also have to present a video that is going to seem interesting to you, that is but

43
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,060
 good in threats we have cybercrime within this is

44
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,739
 apt organizations that are a set of people with high

45
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,330
 computer and development skills that work on developing a

46
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,850
 advanced persistent malware we have the script kiddies who are the people who

47
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,859
 They use manuals and have some knowledge of computer science.

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,190
 the lammers who are people who only use guides that they buy in the market

49
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,540
 black has not one kind of computer knowledge and neither

50
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,010
 have an interest in learning and hacktivists who are people who have

51
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,590
 a common goal against holding protests

52
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,780
 against any kind of alleged government abuse and fall on the side of the

53
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,970
 cybercrime because they start to

54
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,650
 to go against the law by not accessing these systems without authorization

55
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,960
 we also have cyber mercenaries who are highly specialized

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,919
 prepared in development in computer topics which sell their

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,290
 services to government entities and also companies to sabotage

58
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,330
 They also sell their services to natural persons so that they can start

59
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:53,310
 be working doing a theme of my word went away, excuse me

60
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,570
 harassing other people but you can receive a lot of

61
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,070
 calls just from important people who harass them and this guy

62
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,900
 of cyber mercenaries sell their services to these people in order to

63
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,719
 harassing a target not a victim we also have cyberterrorism that

64
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,880
 belongs in this are computer terrorism organizations

65
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,460
 we have cyber espionage that was made up of people

66
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,560
 specialized in carrying out cyber espionage to others to other governments

67
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,920
 especially these work do not belong to organizations

68
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,730
 governmental we have the insider the inside air comes to

69
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,790
 be the person who is unhappy at work

70
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:47,720
 is upset maybe with him with the boss and decides to make a

71
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,160
 a sabotage car and can also be a person who delivers for the purpose of

72
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,400
 perform information leakage and the last and most important threat is the

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,109
 ignorance of the user this is very important we must always train the

74
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,180
 user so that he does not make mistakes and clicks on the link where he can start

75
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,740
 the disaster within the organization and as you can see here we have an m that is

76
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,820
 common to see it in the day to day when the system is cracked the client leaves

77
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,120
 to leave the provider is going to say you did not tell me that the antivirus and the firewall

78
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,570
 They are from cybertron and the provider is saying of course they are not

79
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,800
 but in computing there is no secure system

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,260
 Now if we start, what is the port vell team?

81
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,430
 the por bertín becomes the dynamic produced between the actions carried out

82
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,990
 for the reptile and gluten but for this there has to be an exchange of

83
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,590
 knowledge if there is no exchange of knowledge from part

84
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,419
 of the reptile and the blood in there will never be a port vell team that

85
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,750
 means that the reptile has to give up the ego to take the lead

86
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,350
 always to the blue team because in the real world that's what happens the reptile

87
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,420
 always takes is one step ahead

88
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,419
 I show this is the pyramid of the body of the team that elaborated in how they

89
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:11,469
 I commented to develop a pink paper it is also important that the area of

90
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,330
 management and the operations area work hand in hand all all must

91
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,318
 have one mind and one goal to improve cybersecurity and work

92
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,810
 as a team sharing information at the top we have the Swiss

93
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,560
 what is the security and information officer

94
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,330
 that belongs to the security area and the information we have the head of

95
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,599
 cybersecurity or cybersecurity consultant who belongs to the area of

96
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,650
 computer security or digital security we have routing which is the

97
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,219
 set of people who are dedicated to defense and the rating that is the set

98
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,760
 of people who are dedicated to the offensive side

99
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,969
 what are the objectives of a body the good team the consolidation of

100
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,920
 cyber defense at 99 percent but what about that 1 percent good at 1 percent

101
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,889
 cent becomes a 0 d and not that nobody will be able to stop because it is a

102
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:07,110
 It is a script that nobody knows the idea of ​​forming a portal which is that routing

103
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,689
 become proactive and responsive immediately to

104
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,019
 any type of cyber attack event or situation

105
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:22,399
 here we have the miter attack which is the matrix where it shows you the techniques and

106
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:28,339
 tactics used by cyber attackers this is important that they handle it as much

107
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,110
 This blue team teams like reptile to make their workouts fit

108
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,360
 emphasize that this is only a base because because in the real world a cyber

109
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,958
 There was no attacker to use these techniques to use other techniques more

110
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:47,449
 advanced to be able to carry out an illegal action within your organization but

111
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:53,459
 this helps us to train the blue team well the booty responds in

112
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,719
 his abilities to everything if there were attacks made by reptilian or has

113
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,019
 to respond also to any attack that is made in the real world not that it is

114
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,850
 performs through cyberspace seeking to emigrate

115
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,860
 or looking to go from a reactive defense to a proactive defense that is what

116
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,139
 We look with the blue team for the work plan and a good blue team for the

117
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,810
 research and study of reference solutions we have the

118
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,369
 antivirus firewall wash balancers that also have to be dedicated to

119
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,149
 crowding defense solutions configurations clear create

120
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:33,800
 rules create use cases and keep the solution updated must have their

121
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,410
 own ethical hacking labs to be able to

122
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,320
 know if your settings are working if your settings

123
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,490
 actually block if your settings are doing the

124
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,880
 work that must be done also has to do hunting deals that this is

125
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,139
 this the house of threats must apply digital forensic analysis in

126
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:01,050
 In certain cases there should be a constant monitoring of the network to see what

127
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,990
 connections protrude to the outside

128
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,250
 and a complete inventory of the

129
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,610
 infrastructure this is to say having all the digital assets documented

130
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,050
 and you always have to update the status of this this is a graph that

131
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,389
 I use that I have elaborated where the brooklyn starts his work inside

132
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:29,680
 from the network to the outside as investigating investigating the solutions

133
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,670
 that it has and studying the behavior of the

134
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,339
 reptile or attacker so that to achieve the correct tuning of the

135
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:44,649
 defense devices moving to the next ring we have the monitoring se

136
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,990
 has to collect all the information all network traffic analyze it and

137
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,279
 We also have to be attentive to the alerts sent to us by the follow

138
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:59,709
 some defense systems that we have in organization with this we will achieve

139
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:04,868
 detection and finally we get to the blocking part can be manual or

140
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:10,269
 automatic with this we mitigate the threat the loot has to have

141
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,559
 passion for what he does must be vigilant and must always be based on

142
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,839
 proofs of concept as I mentioned to be able to know if really the

143
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,590
 fine-tuning the configuration that you made works or not

144
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,340
 routing has to use enough jocs that are the indicators of

145
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,590
 compromise see unusual outgoing network traffic see did them boom

146
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,350
 geographic irregularities this is when a connection is established by

147
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,680
 example from your local network to russia this is anomalous you have to validate

148
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,300
 because establishing a connection even to a geographical point where it does not belong

149
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,780
 to your organization or that you do not have any type of any of your suppliers

150
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,740
 works with that ip address that is located abroad

151
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,370
 we also have to see the zone marías with privileged user accounts this

152
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,380
 is we have to have a use case where it is detected when

153
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,320
 accounts are created because a cyber attacker once accesses a system

154
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,190
 windows can create a new user with high privileges we also have to

155
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,540
 see a substantial increase in the read volume of the database on

156
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,959
 they work well this is a very important part

157
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,040
 The work has to be based on the assumption that there is already an attacker

158
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,430
 within the organization therefore what we are going to do is look for that

159
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,189
 unusual behavior as you can see here we have a figure of pacman all

160
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,560
 must meet batman batman is the hunter and the ghost is the apt and he apt

161
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,939
 what you are going to look for is the beige data or get the domaine control to be able

162
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,640
 taking over the entire network is how drag hunting works you could

163
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,010
 have had, making an example, a gap of two years ago where

164
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,990
 took advantage of a 0 day attack and you do not know that you have the intruder within your network

165
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,760
 therefore red hunting will help you find that intruder

166
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,680
 How to use the three good hunting is based on the hypothesis as indicated

167
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,689
 we assume that there is already someone in the network

168
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,290
 we have to identify it and do an investigation and for this example I am

169
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:23,910
 using enema where a scan was made to the host and from ns 01 industrial point

170
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:32,520
 point ml with the local ip address 192 point 168.8 55 in which we observe

171
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,620
 that a scan was made of the 65 thousand 535 ports of which we can observe

172
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:44,160
 port 40 4.118 that n indicates that you are not sure that the

173
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,930
 service is net script we also have the port in green color 8007 that we

174
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:54,390
 indicates that a service is protected and in port 65 1,219 indicates that

175
00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:00,000
 we have an unknown service this must always be documented and sent to the

176
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,710
 you area so that they can make the respective validation that it is not

177
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,840
 from bach doors we also have to take out the port vell team diamond that differs

178
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,760
 a bit of the diamond pattern this part of the adversary where once

179
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:23,130
 who accesses the network will be the pivot will scan the networks

180
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,870
 going to select certain vulnerable devices and start jumping out of

181
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,590
 team in team within the infrastructure until reaching the location of the

182
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:37,170
 victim once you find the victim reestablish command to control and go

183
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,630
 to start filtering data to the public IP of the external of the

184
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,950
 attacker and on the capabilities side home well capabilities

185
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:52,560
 of bluetooth that routing must detect through network flows how to

186
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,010
 the adversary moves within the network at what moment does a scan how it is

187
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,450
 that makes a jump and how it establishes connections for example for that I see that

188
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,400
 are not allowed, it also has to do with the anomalous traffic time and

189
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,000
 also do the analysis of the pickups and organization does not have resources

190
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,380
 So it's all lost, how can we solve it?

191
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,029
 Well, one way to solve it is through the

192
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,220
 passion for what we do we have we have to train ourselves

193
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,249
 study and put into practice with laboratories everything we learn from

194
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:36,939
 offensive side it is necessary to learn training in security issues

195
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:42,399
 offensive to know how to defend yourself we must propose to managers or bosses

196
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,130
 information technology use a framework

197
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:52,860
 at the level of communist management we must also test the insecurity of

198
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,250
 all the infrastructure once we have been trained

199
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,089
 in this way we take care of our work gentlemen

200
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:04,529
 reptile the objective is to know the level of safety maturity of a

201
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:11,370
 organization and discard the assumptions of sgs i.e. the reptile applies to

202
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,300
 a company that already has defense systems that has policies to see if

203
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,829
 it really works or not no that is those yes if it can be validated that those

204
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:24,859
 certificates did we have in the organization

205
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,479
 show the real security that they indicate within the documentation

206
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:36,499
 the reptile work plan we have continuous cycles from three months to six

207
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:39,499
 months depending on the size of the organization in which we have to

208
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,469
 develop penetration tests to the technology infrastructures of the

209
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:46,249
 information we have to carry out wireless hacking this is an attack on

210
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:51,169
 wireless networks test the web applications we have to do

211
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:55,569
 Social engineering attacks on these target phishing and also bicing

212
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:59,509
 we have to carry out constant training for users to taste how

213
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:04,579
 a cyberattack works that they have to live it so that they know that it is in

214
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,230
 risk your job because if you run for no reason web within the

215
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,069
 company it is possible that everyone is left without work within your organization

216
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,638
 We also have to carry out the physical security tests that come se

217
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:24,109
 lift physical controls test scanners show staff

218
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:28,639
 of physical security of how to evade the scanner how they can be

219
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:31,570
 introduce objects

220
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,950
 to the organization that the discovery of jos and

221
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,799
 enumeration of the 65 thousand 535 ports with this we confirm the

222
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,520
 inventory and we also ruled out the issue of backdoors

223
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,000
 this is the graphic that I use in the network has rapt independents it must be

224
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,650
 passionate about your work you have to do a lot of research and be creative because it is

225
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:03,080
 reptile I do not know is not based on running tools do reptile is not a person who

226
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,310
 corre tools is based on being creative, that is, if the blue team detects you and

227
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,929
 block the ip address that I can do to continue performing my

228
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,030
 intrusion if they block us what should I do

229
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,879
 in order to continue carrying out the instruction on that the

230
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,860
 creativity and good hacking in the case of the reptile we start in the part of

231
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,240
 outside this is an example of black box where we do information gathering

232
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,710
 they know open source smart we look for information about the target

233
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,540
 consulting we look for the footprints of that target and obtain information that

234
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,450
 can be used to move on to the next phase, which would be the enumeration of

235
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,970
 analysis therefore as the system or the organization already has defenses

236
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,170
 we have to apply firewall evasion to do the analysis of the services

237
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,190
 versions of the system and with this we are going to establish a technique that we are going to

238
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,290
 use to and go to the next phase which would be the

239
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,030
 exploitation and persistence in which we can use an exploit and

240
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,158
 we will obtain a reverse is the and therefore in the case of a windows system

241
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,409
 there are 32 west we install a file to maintain persistence no and with

242
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,999
 what we are going to achieve is to develop information leakage

243
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:19,610
 no to the command in control all this has to be documented se

244
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,810
 has to report to the cycle of all the work that it develops both from the

245
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,919
 reptile as from the blue team on the racing side as I told you we have to

246
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,760
 make cyber attacks on the technologies we have to carry out engineering attacks

247
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,220
 to the organization's personnel we have to carry out attacks of

248
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,010
 physical intrusion to test security personnel

249
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,129
 and what are the problems of a good reptile

250
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:52,820
 the reptile establishes the detection of a critical attack sends the report to the cis or

251
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,010
 the cis or pass the report to the area that is compromised can be

252
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,510
 telecommunications development and the problem is that there is no

253
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:08,510
 responsibility for those areas and that is why since they know that the person responsible is

254
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,750
 the site and its team if something happens they will take full responsibility

255
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,040
 they do not worry and ignore to carry out the security patches therefore the

256
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,389
 reptilian week detects this and what happens if an attacker agrees with that with that

257
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,200
 Critical vulnerability applies a web reason and then we are all like the

258
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,520
 babies crying no because because we are going to lose not only not only the

259
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,660
 company will lose this money due to lack of business continuity if not

260
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,220
 that it is also possible that a solution will be fired from our work and this is where

261
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,870
 enter to carve the management part is to create a policy in which working

262
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,320
 con with the organization's security policy area or cto

263
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,010
 establish a policy where the person in charge of the area that receives the

264
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,840
 report not saying or knowing that you are responsible for making this patch and for

265
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,039
 Therefore, certain days are determined to mitigate it is

266
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,890
 as well as the ciso can be freed of a certain load and be able to advance to

267
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:16,110
 do other jobs and not get stuck well it's an hour it's time

268
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,649
 from the demo

269
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,840
 our target this group equation at that point ml we are going to use the

270
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,949
 browsers to search for this target to see if it is indexed in

271
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,100
 internet we put the names in beam that we do not find anything we are also

272
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,928
 in the same google search and we found the related name se

273
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:43,200
 starts but not exactly these words then I'm going to use it I'm going to

274
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,630
 search as if it were a domain and we did not find anything placed it in the url and

275
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,750
 let's see if it exists as we see it is a domain is a website that is not

276
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,429
 indexed on the internet we are going to see what we have we are going to look for information that

277
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:06,450
 about what we can take advantage of this target and obtain an address and a

278
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,789
 email then we will go to that address physically to be able to see

279
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,299
 how to access that organization we use wifi analyzer on our device

280
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:22,490
 mobile and we detect a hidden network therefore we return later

281
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,649
 with a jaguar driving vehicle we started our wired in monitor mode with

282
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:35,090
 harmonón once this is achieved we are going to scan

283
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:40,449
 the networks that are around to be able to detect this hidden network and be able to

284
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,260
 perform the cracking and get the password and the real name of the network

285
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,330
 that is hidden in this case the scan of the networks was started

286
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,780
 we already find the bcc and from our target and as we see it is

287
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,470
 hidden but if it indicates that the ssd has 12 characters

288
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:06,260
 well then now we are going to use to get so much to be able to make a

289
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,960
 specific seat to that access point

290
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,390
 with this what I am going to do is establish the correct channel to where

291
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,240
 I'm going to launch the attack because as we know the aces points jump from

292
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,960
 channels to prevent them from being cracked once I set the channel

293
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,030
 I introduce the channel within my script and less with less w I will point to the

294
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:36,180
 path where I am going to save my file point cab where the hans is going to be hosted and

295
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:42,390
 the 4 way jan heino which is the four way squeeze he's in

296
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,530
 hosted password

297
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,909
 with this we verify that there is a client connected therefore this me

298
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:57,039
 it will serve to make an out boy attack to de-authenticate that user by creating

299
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,110
 a denial of service and at and at the time that denial of service ends

300
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,418
 service will connect to it again with the access point and as we see there

301
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:12,520
 It will allow me to reveal the hidden network, we already have the name of the network and the hang

302
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,918
 seng has been captured also site by spice world is the name of the network now

303
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,770
 what we are going to do is carry out the attack with the crack was once done

304
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:30,570
 this we can rename the dot cap file to be able to

305
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:36,689
 and take it in a cb and withdraw from the area and that is how we can do the

306
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,210
 attack is with the vibe offline

307
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,340
 we are executing the attack with the crack we are going to do a multiple attack

308
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,939
 dictionary

309
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,690
 we found the password

310
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,760
 now what we are going to do is connect to the network

311
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,899
 we connect to the hidden network

312
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,660
 we put the name of the network that has been revealed

313
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,940
 6 vor spice world

314
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,850
 and we put the password

315
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,909
 and those gentlemen we are within the network now what

316
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,190
 It is our turn to scan the devices within that network but

317
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,090
 first i have to give it an ip - a spacious ip to be able to know that the

318
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,350
 network segment is being used which is that you will know through the ip that

319
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:07,279
 I have been assigned the hcp one and now what I am going to do is a scan

320
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,210
 of the entire network to be able to determine how many eye devices are

321
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,470
 connected within that network

322
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,400
 once this is done I will scan

323
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:27,189
 discovered devices to find out what services they have

324
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,450
 running inside of them

325
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:38,600
 there you can see that he used less penis in less, what he is going to do is

326
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:46,350
 does not complete the three-way squeeze this means that it only asks the

327
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,800
 service today you are and the service says if this and the service fall waiting for the

328
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,760
 that the three-day squeeze is closed but we do not leave it in the air

329
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,389
 in a moment we will have all the services that are running in each in

330
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:17,230
 each host here we can see that we have a windows service

331
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,190
 because I am using port 445 or 135

332
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,919
 here we can see that we have a server

333
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,809
 Windows also now we are going to pass the evasion phase

334
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:37,290
 firewall and here we have an interesting host in the

335
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,330
 port 22 that can be a router or it can be a linux service calls me the

336
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,530
 Attention because only this ssh port has open then I will work

337
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:53,580
 about that host then point to that games using udyco bis attack

338
00:27:53,580 --> 00:28:00,960
 coishco this is using using hyper fake this is a way to evade this

339
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,610
 firewalls let's see if it works

340
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:11,130
 we carry out the results and see port 22 and what has

341
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:17,820
 returned is that if we have a gnu linux ubuntu operating system but we do not

342
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,230
 has shown more then we are going to change technique we are going to use another attack

343
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,090
 another scan, sorry this one

344
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,999
 to be able to see what services because I know that there are services inside

345
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:38,020
 so we no longer use disk today and we are going to use

346
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,280
 the zombie attack the zombie type zombie scan no

347
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,889
 for this I will have to start this sales play to help me

348
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:55,120
 help find this unipec is that it is valid within the network

349
00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:02,830
 which is going to show us this sequence chalice

350
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:14,410
 here we are going to use the minus parameter s is an idol scan attack

351
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,640
 from a zombie host

352
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:29,340
 and here comets flowers we are going to use the auxiliary

353
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,730
 when the parameters use an auxiliary scanner

354
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,780
 and they say

355
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:53,130
 I am going to accept the host which is the entire network segment in order to find a

356
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,980
 IP address that indicates me even if it shows me the sequence air

357
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,860
 not how to increase it ran and I already got

358
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,560
 this is going to serve me point 2

359
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:17,320
 so here what I'm going to do is use as a zombie host s & p

360
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,120
 and launched the scan again

361
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,399
 we will see the results shortly

362
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,010
 and supports interrupt scanning for termite exploits

363
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,100
 and as you can see we already have new ports, the evasion of

364
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,459
 firewall but it is not showing services are protected but i

365
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,940
 I want to see what services are then I am going to change certain parameters in

366
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:16,110
 script we have to see what is there

367
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,080
 and ran it

368
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,379
 [Applause]

369
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,460
 and we can see the services we have the 445 microsoft the samba service in

370
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:51,059
 several on the 139 and port 80 the web service and it seems that it is a windows

371
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:56,158
 but we know that there are 1.1 therefore we can assume that it is a samba service

372
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,899
 which is deployed then what I am going to do now is attack that server

373
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:05,189
 linux I am going to access the linux server and for that I am going to attack the ssh service no

374
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,440
 I am going to use jellyfish in this case, this is going to taste, you can use the first one

375
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:20,160
 hydra or another tool with less h I will point to the non-target ip of the 129

376
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,780
 we have been working on - if I am going to indicate where you are in the

377
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,830
 path where they are and dictionaries and users and minus p indicating where they are

378
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:34,020
 find the path of my password dictionary and minus cmb indicate the

379
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,480
 service that keeps attacking in this case ssh what makes medusa good to use

380
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:46,170
 the first word of the users file in this case is admin and it will be the most

381
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,280
 with all the words that we have inside the dictionary passwords in

382
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,379
 in this case the peace dictionary and as you can see on the screen it is

383
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,200
 using by the most famous and quietest passwords of all years

384
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,690
 we don't have admin 1234 terminator champions

385
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:15,490
 superman 1 2 3 4 5 6 admin and so the time this attack takes is going to

386
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,710
 depend on the complexity of the password

387
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,880
 to excuse me running but not

388
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,930
 45 minutes or five minutes is too short for me we already got a

389
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,610
 user is system and password then we are going to connect by ssh

390
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:52,100
 ubuntu not that is h we use system the user that we have found at

391
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:58,439
 ip address of our target of our point

392
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:06,219
 and we put the password no qwerty 1 2 3

393
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,520
 well friends we are already inside the ubuntu

394
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,860
 with Juan and we are going to see how we are a system, we do not have privileges

395
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:26,850
 common envelopes with one and less to see the system architecture

396
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:33,449
 I check documents and I can't find anything but I see something interesting and we put

397
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,730
 the user system and at agency this means that it is indicating that

398
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,460
 possibly there are more users so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back

399
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,690
 directories to home to visit how many users we have we found it

400
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,270
 itself will be accessed to review the

401
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:55,310
 documents that are inside it to see if we find something interesting we see

402
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:03,880
 that are used in pairs because the oriana spray

403
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,879
 we are going to list this we are going to first access documents to see if

404
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,500
 we find something there we are going to list it and we find a file top dot txt

405
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,559
 let's see with cap that we have inside this file

406
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:26,360
 male cyber space can serve us but I prefer to see the hidden files by

407
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:33,140
 that I give ls - celia and if we have a secret point file txt funcas

408
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,569
 we review the file and find a string of characters that can be the

409
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,640
 password we are looking for to use against the mail

410
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,609
 q against the email account that we have

411
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:52,730
 detected as we already know that it is an ubuntu then we assume that it is

412
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,430
 possibly using a webmail so let's try to access the service

413
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,730
 mail

414
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:11,170
 we are already using the user snowden brou equation at that point of ml is not

415
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:16,420
 the password then if it is a hash what we have to do is clip tasks

416
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,349
 we are going to use different services to see where we find

417
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:24,180
 where we can detect the hash

418
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:31,320
 here we find nothing a share of 5 online to see if we are lucky we will

419
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:38,359
 creep and if we find the password friends

420
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:42,919
 we have the password and we are going to use it

421
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,000
 what we are going

422
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,690
 and we are inside and the email account

423
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:02,530
 we open this file and it shows us how good the configuration manual is.

424
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,970
 for mobile clients we have nothing in the inbox

425
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:12,169
 but we are going to look in drafts in drafts and we find a file

426
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:17,650
 who has a recipient wolf 2 space wood

427
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:23,680
 We also see that there is a compressed file host recipe and we have a

428
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,490
 message that is encoded this is interesting

429
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:36,160
 first knowing is we are going to analyze the domain spybot web ml and for that

430
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,509
 let's use quiz

431
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,950
 the domain does not exist therefore it is a smokescreen

432
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,789
 now what we are going to do is

433
00:37:52,839 --> 00:38:02,130
 decode the message we will reveal the message and from what I see space 64

434
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,890
 we hit

435
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:15,240
 the code and encoded

436
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,030
 here we have already reveals the message is in English we can use the translator

437
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,460
 google to see it in spanish

438
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:35,869
 the unit stands out to operate on november 15 at 7 pm in south america 4

439
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:39,920
 operators peru and colombia- apply redirection from proxy servers

440
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,380
 transparent in russia apply bucket on compressed windows servers

441
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,140
 compressed to surprise is the file to be used

442
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,510
 well there we have the file this compressed

443
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,350
 this gz point and we also have confirmation from the operators who have

444
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,860
 received the message, that is, this means that there are several operators.

445
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,029
 people who use this email account to be able to

446
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:11,710
 transmit information good friends I hope this to you

447
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:18,309
 I liked what we passed to the questions part

448
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:20,999
 Thank you

449
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,250
 roman

450
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:40,170
 thanks to the questions not some

451
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:46,799
 are a bit of the details of what you've been showing then I'm going to

452
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:51,220
 start at the beginning with generic magic

453
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:56,830
 there is one that says this does not have to be more than a matter of knowledge if I

454
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:01,420
 I am involved in computing, what basic knowledge should I have if

455
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,270
 I want to start making a hold or a blue timer

456
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:11,700
 good to start in this world

457
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,848
 to do to be also useless you have to start by acquiring

458
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,180
 knowledge of the offensive side this means that you have to carry

459
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,790
 Ethics hacking training or courses depends on sting to know how

460
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:32,420
 an attacker moves within the network that is a very important part because

461
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:39,050
 I tell you from experience I was taking a course from a brand and I have realized

462
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:45,540
 because I can do less within the defenses because the

463
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,910
 knowledge they teach you on the defensive side I'm talking about the side of the

464
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:56,720
 iron marks does not attract my attention this because

465
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,939
 as I tell you this is not about running tools it is not about using this and marks

466
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,320
 to defend your organization different irons different softwares if not

467
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,670
 it's about pure knowledge you don't have to know how an attacker moves to

468
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:15,320
 to be able to see that analyze that flow traffic is not to say to me they give me a system

469
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,869
 genius linux wifi is the chs and that is enough for me I do not need a 100 I do not need

470
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:24,650
 another type of tool to be able to detect the movement of an attacker and

471
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:29,840
 I have already put that to the test at work not when we have received a

472
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,609
 audit of an organization and what we have done is to test our

473
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:39,470
 maturity in our work I did not tell him next to the loot well you work

474
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,939
 with his they continue with all his defense tools and I with my wii fishlabs to him

475
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,410
 who finds the attackers first and it was me

476
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,808
 oh and why because the booking is still waiting for an alert to be able to

477
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:57,520
 react but nevertheless if you know what an attacker looks like you will

478
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,299
 know what you are doing if you are doing a scan like you are doing this

479
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:07,620
 fragmented scan or you are doing this scan with less pn

480
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,040
 etc. through traffic analysis

481
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:19,950
 suspicious unusual traffic good other questions if ok as i say

482
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,419
 there are several there are several like me then I want

483
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:30,610
 also compile some of them for example one that I saw out there was also

484
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:37,040
 especially about the monkey how did you know the name of the account

485
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,350
 mail is what goes in any case to the left of the at some people

486
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,950
 and they pointed there from where it could have been obtained because they have seen it but I think

487
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:49,310
 that it would be interesting to indicate that is how it was in this demo and what it would be like

488
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,540
 in general terms in general terms that could be obtained

489
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,090
 potential and non-potential usernames

490
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:03,600
 good email accounts are going to apologize because it has been

491
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,610
 this very quick to the demo is for a time issue that had to do it like this in

492
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:13,410
 the website I repeat the domain name so they can see it online

493
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:19,839
 at this time is equation grow at that point ml and can

494
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,370
 enter the domain now live and you can see it at the bottom we

495
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:29,440
 indicates an address and is where we had to do the physical form to

496
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,980
 be able to pass this wifi analyzer and be able to detect the hidden wifi network and below

497
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:41,410
 we have a corporate email account on one line from that domain no

498
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:49,359
 and we have aimed to use that only data we have to make use of the

499
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,880
 account and access the mail service no and be able to continue with the with the

500
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,180
 process

501
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,290
 ok there are other questions that are also

502
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,029
 in red if you listen to me if you heard you perfectly water

503
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,640
 there are other questions that I am also going to try more or less to condense the not

504
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,720
 at some point they were asking for example about those enema results if

505
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,779
 somehow they could be incorporated into some database or some application

506
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:41,000
 in a way that helps with continuous monitoring of which ports are open

507
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,390
 which ports have closed filtering that is running on each one and see if for

508
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,799
 at least there is an indication that if it is authorized it is not authorized that or

509
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,850
 be a bit like to monitor the situation of ports and services

510
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:59,750
 in the systems that one is protecting and that I am also going to put together because it is

511
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,040
 something by pulp and in this general with some more questions that arise out there

512
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,250
 For example, from the start, not how you avoid in an exercise of this type by

513
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:17,150
 For example, the timing part will not be detected, that is, as in numbers

514
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,910
 For example, what protection extends your goals and how do you try to get past it?

515
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:25,910
 above them and something that also has to do a lot with it

516
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:29,779
 because as I say at the end everything is a matter for tim and how the

517
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,809
 documentation that is how it keeps the record of everything so much what is

518
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:37,460
 making the network part like the bruno part that is how a record is kept

519
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,520
 I think that all of this can be answered in general terms of

520
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,339
 what are the best practices to handle all that

521
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:55,500
 of course for that we can use that ctm we can search this

522
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:03,320
 the other kind of some kind of framework not in regards to the reports the reports

523
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:09,290
 can be sent daily and at the end of the week a report was sent

524
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:13,970
 weekly of everything that has been worked on both side of the iplus and there are also

525
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:19,509
 what exercise program to like the idea

526
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:23,380
 of a cut the team is to share knowledge therefore the house part

527
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,789
 of the renouncement of the reptile not to the ego not to say hey you know that I am always a

528
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:32,319
 step up from gluten and that's it that's true in the real world always reptilian

529
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,550
 you will be one step ahead you do not have to give up that ego and share

530
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,910
 information with the booty so that routing has that ability also to

531
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,140
 be proactive

532
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:49,320
 and among friends of tools that could support all that work

533
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:56,610
 what tools can be used and I mean both the work of for example

534
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:02,550
 to do the initial reconnaissance and to find those elements of protection and

535
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:08,130
 the back even at blood level and I don't know what things they could be

536
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,360
 using as tools because it is clear that sometimes you do not need

537
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,680
 much like what is being demonstrated is something that is very sophisticated but there are

538
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,890
 some tools they are using in particular to record all of that

539
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:27,440
 well the booking works with the tools that it has at hand it does not have

540
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:34,119
 100 has the firewall and as I mentioned one of

541
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:39,820
 they are based more on waiting for a topic from an alert and then doing the monitoring

542
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:45,580
 they do not work hand in hand also with the no which is the networking center

543
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,380
 and communication has to be this continuous no more and more than anything now that

544
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,180
 We are in a time of constant cyberattacks not where it is

545
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,100
 take advantage of many bugs and critical vulnerabilities this is where

546
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,560
 you have to work together there should be enough communication with the

547
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,549
 management area with the cis or with the cybersecurity builder to be able to

548
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:15,369
 take corrective measures and always be updating policies as well

549
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:18,029
 well

550
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:24,720
 as for the tools well this moved from used enema

551
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,509
 for me it is a powerful tool I know that it has certain errors and walter a

552
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,230
 demonstrate in a course that you have certain errors on the map but you have a

553
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,280
 very powerful tool I recommend using n map

554
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,780
 What they should keep in mind is not to make a lot of noise when doing the

555
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,790
 Spanish to which you just have to have a laboratory to be able to practice and

556
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:52,290
 realize not at what moment it generates noise at the moment it does not generate live a

557
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,490
 Once everything has uploaded, the bloody system will detect blocking and blocking you

558
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,459
 the ipea good i blocked until the ip so now what do i do

559
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:06,490
 I change ip because I am already connected so I am doing a test within

560
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,540
 the organization I am doing a white box test because I have the

561
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,320
 cable r what it does is change the ip it is not that it is a method it is not as I say

562
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,520
 it's a matter of using your imagination the unit no new say hey my block it

563
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,550
 and what's up, I'm dead, it's not about that

564
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:28,370
 because the last one, if for example, that is, I was attracted by what this explains and what

565
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,170
 that you proved no and finishing all the talks

566
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:38,590
 of this nit ox what should be my next step, so it is the first

567
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:44,980
 What should I do to find a book and start reading to install I do not know any

568
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,900
 software is going to be something in particular whatever it is thanks also to

569
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,230
 all the talks from layún and toxic and I'm so excited I want to start

570
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,740
 based on what everything is explaining what should be the first action that

571
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,819
 could pass a single already good for those who are starting

572
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,040
 as I told you one is to train and learn the subject of hacking how

573
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,320
 The pen testing works elect to hakim and what must be done is to have your

574
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,190
 own laboratories because because their laboratories have to be adjusted to

575
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:20,240
 real world you have to have unpatched windows machines and windows machines

576
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,450
 with patches you have to have windows machine with antivirus

577
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:29,779
 you have to have your firewall you have to have linux systems and create a whole

578
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,410
 network lab and work on them to see what works and what doesn't

579
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:39,490
 clogging to cloud so i started on this new trial and error case

580
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,029
 and understanding how

581
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,308
 how the traffic works within the network and mostly my detection is based on

582
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:53,280
 do to check network flow

583
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:59,730
 ok here in rafáh thank you very much although walter thanks to you thanks to

584
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:08,850
 share already 6 peru and also this 6 already upc thanks
