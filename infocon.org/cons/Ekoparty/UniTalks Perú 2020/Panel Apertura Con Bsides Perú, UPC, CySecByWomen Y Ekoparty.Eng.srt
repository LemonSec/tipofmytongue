1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
good morning everyone to all the people who are listening to us from any

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,030
 Latin American country this is the third edition that we are doing of

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,750
 university talks so I guess as we move forward with the

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,698
 incorporation of new segments we are also incorporating other types

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,240
 from other Latin American countries in this particular edition we are with the

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,990
 people from Peru today we will be chatting briefly how we do

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,500
 always in all these editions at the beginning so that they can be given to

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,649
 know a little more about the community and the rest of the people who always

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,180
 They accompany us, we have Carlos from the University of Peru of Sciences

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,100
 applied to voltaire on behalf of bit sites perú and alison from side sec

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,190
 women from peru so let's chat a bit with them hello guys

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,739
 for the boys, how are they? I'm fine

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:01:00,600
 Hi everyone, I'm not going to do a presentation round briefly if you

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,210
 they tell the community a little about their role within the community

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,789
 that they are representing at this moment it is believed that we started with walter

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,920
 Now again all well, we here in Peru already have a history of

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,510
 work in communities on safety issues dating back to at least the

18
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:31,040
 2009 and a couple of years ago we were able to start working here with besides Peru

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,280
 what is this matter of that security conference that is like that

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,110
 a chain at a global level, the interesting thing about all this is that it uses

21
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,310
 in that we are integrating with other communities that were already before or

22
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,710
 that arose later in fact in that 66 by boom community in which

23
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,889
 we work a lot hand in hand with the goal of sharing knowledge

24
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,550
 share people's experiences at all levels, not just when they

25
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,570
 organize conferences but have that exchange continuously and

26
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,898
 permanent so that the safety issue that fascinates me all always

27
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:13,140
 go ahead well what do you want to introduce yourself a little like this

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,549
 people know you at least tell that what is your role within the

29
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,690
 visa community is peru

30
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,959
 so that's like what I put when they gave me information but more or

31
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,459
 Be one of the coordinators and it was my turn right now, nothing more, and this role

32
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:35,850
 There is no if it literally happened I prefer that the others continue

33
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,180
 perfect allison, how are you?

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,879
 about you so the community understands what your role is that you are representing

35
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,060
 get out of kumán there is still good morning with everyone my name leaves are lara

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,489
 I am actually one of the founders of serving it wants that it was going to human that is

37
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,659
 a community at the latam level where we promote that more women get everything

38
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,590
 the theme in city security this is created in conjunction with natalie who

39
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,170
 This is my companion always in everything in everything we organize together with the

40
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,950
 other girls that they eat well something that also helps us in the whole subject

41
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,589
 organizational we do events with different communities there are always some

42
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,739
 there is walter from the upc also who does in march before just before we

43
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,989
 they will quarantine we had an event where several girls were able to put good

44
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,849
 They were able to present here on cybersecurity issues and this is quite nice

45
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:41,239
 the event between people from argentina ecuador

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,120
 Panama was actually quite a good event and always

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,490
 supporting that in a free content and in which it is more people can grab

48
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:58,310
 and can promote all safety issues not that can help

49
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,570
 communities continue to grow and we can make a set and we can help each other

50
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,609
 between all is gold

51
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,080
 Well thank you very much Carlos, by introducing them a little, tell your role

52
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,690
 inside the university yes of course yes thank you very much my name

53
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,320
 is Carlos Valdez today the director of the electronic engineering school is the upc

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,150
 in charge of some careers among others the engineering of networks and communications

55
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,229
 It is in this particular race that we have been carrying out a

56
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:36,250
 series of events related to the issue of security and I recognize that the role

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,000
 of the communities that exist is not very important and here I believe that the

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,890
 ornament that is the coordinator the race has done a great job of

59
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,789
 relationship with these communities because in our country in Peru

60
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,410
 it still takes a lot

61
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:04,330
 awareness is still a great need to raise awareness more and more

62
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,240
 to people who in general but in particular if we are talking about a

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,879
 University like ours interests us a lot and future professionals in

64
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,550
 networks and communications are well aware of the importance of the subject

65
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,469
 I can count this a more or less recent event and not so suddenly the year

66
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:30,969
 past months with what pandemics everything happened so it seems that time is

67
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:36,639
 I would have sped up but last year during the events at the Pan American

68
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,490
 that it was carried out that in Lima this in the previous month there were 5 million

69
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,210
 attacks of course this had previously deserved the

70
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,508
 attention of one of a specialized commission and it was really possible to take

71
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:58,710
 the extent of the case but we are very vulnerable in this whole issue in general

72
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,219
 that's why I think having opportunities like this event

73
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:08,189
 definitely contribute to the awareness raising issue that is

74
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,819
 give it more and more importance it is not our career we have several courses

75
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,719
 information security related to inflated networks

76
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:21,889
 configuring in short but all these events that complement the need for

77
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:27,750
 know more and more and be very found I think it is absolutely

78
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:35,330
 important and I ask everyone how they get to

79
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,748
 meet or get in touch there is a story in how you meet saiz with

80
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:46,849
 beats sites or someone studied at the upc as how they will get to know each other

81
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,378
 how these three people get to be today chatting with me in the

82
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,039
 let's go stream

83
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,549
 they don't like it

84
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,539
 to rancagua

85
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:19,990
 in that communication and that contact so it's so frequent and I don't remember

86
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:27,860
 no I don't remember but if we met there

87
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:37,879
 if you can the other way around but it is clearer it is far away to say before the

88
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,409
 communities in which they are represented today yes and if it was

89
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:49,039
 Before it was before and with the ups what happens is that I have a couple of starts

90
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,370
 relationship with fish or the history of what I know as a university

91
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,949
 is that it starts from an institute called cybertech and in those

92
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:03,800
 years I studied in cyber t and then I have known Renato as he works in

93
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,240
 another institution and as Carlos Renato used to say well, that is, to everyone every time you are

94
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,340
 community initiatives support us a lot because then

95
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,030
 We have always started to work together and little by little he has continued talking if the

96
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,500
 people we have converged towards asia lópez that is why we will have

97
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,760
 found support is for him due to migration and the story is that as we have

98
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,830
 known and then it can be said that sober computing is something that already

99
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,569
 has been in Peru for many years even before communities are formed

100
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,049
 that having been the reason why they started to get together having the same

101
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,728
 interests and I said many of us are several people like how creation arises

102
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,980
 How does the incorporation of the computer series to, for example, the university arise

103
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,170
 I do not know if in this institution we have mentioned this voltaire already

104
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,589
 security existed in an ethical way today something that is included but later when

105
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,110
 did the university seem unable to answer carlos

106
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,860
 Well, actually look at this one and as Walter said, don't be

107
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,140
 good in our case good for me or a very important key person has

108
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,920
 been decorated because he has been related to the communities and also did not know

109
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,279
 walter

110
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:28,050
 so it is and well it has been said by the way

111
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,380
 network and communications engineering career is a little

112
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:39,990
 Advertising is the only one in its nature, let's say, here in the country, although

113
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,050
 it seems incredible I would not like to have competitors of course because always

114
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,959
 good true to improve but it is printed in that way but the subject

115
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,399
 But when you say that it is the only one that refers to you, it is the only one

116
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,310
 look at those communications and computer insurance networks

117
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,510
 how good if there are also races that have to do of course

118
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,680
 opera also has a career in information systems no and there

119
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,120
 They also deal with these issues, not and in fact they have invited the entire

120
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,270
 community, but because it is a very important issue, no security, no

121
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,579
 but we are always in what he wanted to say we are on the hunt for

122
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,100
 opportunities that serve us all, not because as I said these topics of

123
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,250
 raise awareness the more we can do it the better the more

124
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,370
 let us also incorporate in academic training

125
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,540
 so good I want the relationship issue is important but

126
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,550
 again strengthen these ties and these opportunities I believe that we all

127
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,240
 are useful not here I think the issue is basically that we all

128
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,699
 Let's strengthen and not enrich you, we are with the

129
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,569
 knowledge the experiences that exist and it is the only way to advance in

130
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:03,339
 this so the thing on the subject of the

131
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,519
 need to work together as a team

132
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,350
 If they already did it when was the last one, it is that they worked together or this

133
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:20,290
 it would be the first time they make an appearance in digital media

134
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,339
 so to speak or in lecture format

135
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,800
 [Music] hong

136
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,850
 I worked with the upct and with walters and in the edition we did of

137
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:41,240
 security tip now in March so you could say it was the

138
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,160
 last because you already guessed the pandemic and well it was quite a topic not just another topic

139
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,360
 complicated to be able to organize something but but then you don't do what they

140
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,240
 remember that it was the last one, the others, I don't know on the internet if others have been made

141
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,329
 used masters last year fears we organize webinars

142
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:05,599
 sure enough

143
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:12,589
 we want to work with the three of us together in the same event

144
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:20,069
 March because the webinars and not everything but yes as long as I remember the

145
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,199
 three together the fish with you walter and with the community was in March and the

146
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:31,248
 last year we also had another one that was visas and bed

147
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:39,089
 description here because we got this to bring help everyone to it was great it is

148
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,329
 experience but we get wishing to be an issue has been an encore so isolates

149
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:48,029
 Really because they gave me an explanation of various countries but this is, I don't know if

150
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,119
 already publicly everyone knows it but one thing that does seem to me

151
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:55,350
 interesting to tell is that the day progressed very well in parallel talks

152
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,939
 enough people and everyone else and suddenly in the afternoon all over the area in the

153
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:04,219
 university campus without electricity

154
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:14,710
 what was going to happen is over, that is, the people and those who made their

155
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,279
 talk is when they did not have traditional elements such as their

156
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,110
 presentation and everything else ended super well because I mean on top

157
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,580
 They were very unique wheat they are very technical and very histrionic and people had a great time

158
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,089
 very well with all that, yes, it is a very interesting company, truth

159
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,970
 that we had and it was there we were also the three of us because not only stress

160
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,220
 organization to continue working together those kinds of moments of imperfections

161
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,930
 in production that above have absolutely nothing to do with all

162
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,500
 The previous one is working to get to the event that day for me

163
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,310
 they are the ones that also are the relationships here in the leopard team and

164
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,489
 they happen to us or they are doing so many years in the conference has

165
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,470
 I've been through absolutely everything since I don't know someone very important and

166
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:05,430
 give a final talk decide not to come or get my flight canceled

167
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,400
 it cuts out again in the first podcast of the echo that we are doing

168
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,939
 with confetti but also in all the part of the operating equipment and here in

169
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,440
 tandil we are left without started to climb so that he will tell you how good it is that

170
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,160
 we are going to contract all the services in the area and put the

171
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,900
 I congratulate the unser préval here are things that escape but I feel that

172
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,470
 in those moments he finishes connecting more and it becomes a much more experience

173
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,300
 unique because how many conferences have there been to people who at least

174
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,170
 is listening now where the power has been cut and has remained the same and the

175
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,959
 people had a good time like buzz

176
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,100
 other communities or that other institutions in Peru have

177
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,190
 work in the past that you would be interested in mentioning in this space

178
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:05,020
 so that people also know us if they have

179
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,500
 makes us much more where we have worked for example in

180
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,300
 set but some things that do seem to me, that is, it is important to rescue

181
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,800
 or mention that the one that somehow also relates to the upc I don't know

182
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,040
 with current be this but and take out how like this community that is most

183
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,360
 oriented to auditors but that I later also change to having people who do

184
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,009
 Information security management has always been very active and has

185
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:38,830
 given plenty of room for people to share knowledge

186
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,459
 to open a space where people can talk about these issues

187
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:49,279
 and it even has chapters in universities and upc at least I know

188
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,800
 that they started a pure young student chapter there but with the same

189
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,199
 objective no then it seems to me that their work that has been going on for several years

190
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,429
 It is an interesting work because as I say if it is true that somehow

191
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:09,259
 comes with some initiative from outside but the local people are the ones who

192
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,760
 keeps there they are well organized well

193
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,300
 Walter thinks he mentions some other institution with which they have worked

194
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,270
 altogether related in terms of over computing

195
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,870
 if they have been done in the past Carlos

196
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,380
 looking one more pixel to the right

197
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:44,819
 but practically what walter was commenting on is not really that I think

198
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,390
 there is a lot of activity in this regard, not those communities that you mentioned

199
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,670
 west I think they are the most important and I think the interesting thing is that

200
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,680
 has penetrated the academic world and that is where I think we have to

201
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,440
 have a lot of influence on the third theme of the training, not its

202
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,790
 strengthening the involvement of more people in this issue which is a

203
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,940
 Nowadays, these are the communities that we have already seen with whom we

204
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,109
 works together and that we will always be willing to know and

205
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,349
 support us because that's where the thing goes

206
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:24,688
 and this question goes for the lesson I would like you to tell me a little about the

207
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:31,080
 need I do not know if the need but how the idea of ​​creating a

208
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,939
 specifically women's community because in every country across the globe

209
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,010
 world has always been a minority and within it that the sure

210
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,190
 computing is a minority within the computing pole is a minority of a

211
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,370
 minority shows that when it is a little if you are interested and if you want

212
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,689
 share something related by the disturbance of a need or simply

213
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,170
 it was like waiting let's do something little friend

214
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,730
 It was not so much if what happens is that if at some point I think they are told

215
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,480
 some people that with nothing we are a computer engineer by

216
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,850
 yes in computer engineering general engineering there are not many women

217
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,750
 and more on the security issue of two courses that we took courses that we were

218
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,320
 Only the two of them was not how I had been able to find one more girl

219
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,270
 but there was no more then yes I think sometime

220
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,830
 that we did talk or see that we see that the events were not so many

221
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,510
 women find how they are with walter with some other people and we

222
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,400
 commented that in Argentina, for example, if there was the issue of

223
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,340
 Gnostics and some other things we said ok because it cannot also be for Peru and

224
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:54,530
 we started looking we started with nothing to form the community

225
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,680
 we started looking for other girls who could join or who were

226
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,040
 interested in the subject and in this and good that they see that there are also other women

227
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,590
 that they also get into the whole security issue no and that was the nice thing to be able to

228
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,429
 find more girls that we have like that affinity in the subject and power

229
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,810
 talk and that it is not only for boys, not that at some point some

230
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:25,389
 They commented on it, so that's where it goes is worth the reason why we decided

231
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,029
 forming this community that it already has is going to be two years old this year and with that

232
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:36,740
 well there and walter gave us good luck and to mention in the

233
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,409
 the beat side event is this peru that they did in 2018 here and from there

234
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:46,519
 we started and from there we are actively participating with walter with

235
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,649
 the opt or with different speakers that we can do webinars a workshop or

236
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:57,709
 something and so that way we are to grow this

237
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:07,210
 then but there we try to keep it good the truth to maintain and create

238
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,520
 communities and it is usually quite a matter but when

239
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,940
 when you start to feel or when you manage to convey that sense of belonging

240
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,950
 towards people who are forming the ego is something that for me you have a magic

241
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,010
 that is not found anywhere else taking advantage of the fact that we are talking a

242
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,400
 little of the communities that are formed beyond if they are created communities

243
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,020
 outside an institution or within

244
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,129
 I do not know of the group of friends or people that is associated with a career as a group

245
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,650
 of work, how can we tell people that

246
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,590
 you're listening to us right now if you feel like coming out on

247
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,740
 you if you want have have cattle approach visas in cattle reach

248
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,080
 sites & women's and they want to go to the upc to find out about the race and

249
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,340
 try to attend any of the events that are taking place if

250
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,189
 believe each one briefly tell how they can get in touch

251
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,500
 so this is not simply a comment and can continue to help

252
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,539
 grow the Peruvian community

253
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,409
 On the visa side, it is really the point of contact, it will always be the

254
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:22,809
 twitter account that s bisite you do not decide that you did not see and there we

255
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,889
 you can contact us

256
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,970
 Salson on my side we are

257
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:37,539
 twitter and linkedin on facebook as 66 by woman there I can leave the data for

261
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,740
 same

262
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:05,428
 Carlos yes in our case well we are in the upct of wps point bpy engineering

263
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,690
 of networks and communications in the race where we decide a lot on the issues

264
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,389
 that we have talked we are there for [Music]

265
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:19,250
 to receive it coordinate study and good and

266
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,830
 work together welcome and I have two last things before

267
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,409
 we say goodbye one would be what advice would they give to the community to the community that

268
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,030
 They want to talk to you, it can be absolutely all the people who are in Peru

269
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:39,920
 interested in security formally or simply for the communities that we

270
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,700
 are listening right now what would be the only advice they would give if

271
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,050
 could give it

272
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:55,540
 I would tell them that the first thing is that they speak already and that is very important that

273
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,290
 be clear that this matter as I said is a router to share

274
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,428
 knowledge and experiences that sense we all have to learn all the

275
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:08,130
 days so they should speak without fear should ask should share

276
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,590
 without fear and that

277
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,330
 let's say as the first the first step the next step I would have would be

278
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,039
 be clear is that in reality there is nothing complex in all this that is the

279
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,750
 people may take less or more time to learn something but yes or yes they will

280
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,370
 so they should start with the clear idea that if they are going to get

281
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,340
 things since I do not know if suddenly someone is interested in the management of the

282
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,230
 security and wants to go down that path that can be complex or what

283
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,710
 usually people think it might be the hardest thing when they hear that the

284
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,960
 people are talking about exploit or reverse engineering and things like that

285
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,070
 everything can be learned if then they do not take it as that it is impossible because of him

286
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,299
 On the contrary, it is super possible, it is some things that I would advise people and that

287
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,620
 they can achieve it with the communities

288
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,950
 blind blood if it is really only

289
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:12,310
 complementing what what walter says not on my side I think the worst is also

290
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:18,220
 What we can do is not ask, do not try to learn, that is, think about what

291
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,660
 the questions we can ask may turn out to be a little bit not out of the

292
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,730
 place or something but one is never born knowing the only way to learn

293
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,910
 is is asking knowing suddenly turning out a little special or insistent

294
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,680
 otherwise, if the first one was not understood, you can consult again and until you

295
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,000
 you can learn this I share what walter experiences that is actually when

296
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,300
 you already know the subject suddenly to you it is not very very extraordinary or something

297
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,480
 not bone like the one who does not know will always have a fear of

298
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,740
 redundancy the unknown but when you do not want to get into the subject and

299
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,710
 take so much affection to this that in reality it returns to your day to day and is

300
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,900
 something that good one can grasp and can continue to forge and every day there are

301
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,440
 something new to learn all 16 new methods every day always

302
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,610
 new challenges and this makes it more beautiful and interesting is this race in

303
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,679
 reality so for those who are just starting

304
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:32,559
 and can I suggest you read there is always a

305
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,029
 lots of information on the internet there are free forums there is a lot of information

306
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:39,700
 from which they can be leveraged and there are communities like the ones we are

307
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,980
 showing that in a certain way they help knowledge to continue to grow and

308
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,650
 I can reach more people not only that

309
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,080
 I value if you want to add them to the and yes well

310
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,159
 if not also complementing what this arizona and walter have said and I believe

311
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:07,250
 that the important thing is that now and there are communities and I think that facilitates

312
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,190
 enough let's say the availability of information but always the spirit of

313
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,480
 wanting to share is something very important that I think also characterizes

314
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,280
 communities and all these groups with whom we agree to

315
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:28,520
 do events etc. I did not see that I think it is actually to be recognized as well

316
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,929
 that we live in an absolutely vulnerable society

317
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:42,490
 I think that those who like these topics are the ones who say I'm interested not

318
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:49,260
 for all that it means, I do not believe that the existence of communities

319
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,030
 participation in them is something is something key so that's why the

320
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:00,240
 importance due to participation in such an environment

321
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,260
 but good in all these tips they are seeing they also serve absolutely for

322
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:10,580
 any context anywhere in the world is a bit of what always

323
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,390
 It is good to transmit beyond the country we are in or the culture the

324
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,659
 community because they are councils that will serve absolutely all the time

325
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:24,240
 it is also a question of what they continue today as the super

326
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,879
 informative for this as a I do not know if the word as a minority within the

327
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:34,320
 computing in general is still huge there is room for still

328
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,639
 a lot more people who want to get involved there are different types of

329
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:42,689
 specializations because it is quite difficult to cover everything at one level

330
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,990
 extremely deep particularly if you want to do research not

331
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,179
 you can be doing without research of these technologies

332
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,509
 we have time because some areas rob us of seeing shows but they take a long time

333
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:56,820
 time and to finish closing briefly if they have the ability to

334
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,889
 change something of the computer surfing community in peru like this with a click

335
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:07,229
 from simple that it would be then what they would choose to change can be a

336
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,249
 answer as a word

337
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,280
 and

338
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,720
 no participation more participation yes yes yes yes yes what

339
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,350
 happens is that you know what to do a word but I think yes to imagine what it was

340
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:30,399
 contribute and this and for various reasons sometimes out of shyness sometimes because they believe

341
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,240
 that what they can contribute is very basic and elementary they do not do it and for the

342
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,530
 On the contrary, as I think it happens in the whole world, you have a lot of charlatans

343
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:43,960
 knocking on the door they want to grab and dress up as little red riding hood and go to

344
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,680
 talk to people and they don't really add anything to them, it has no value or

345
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,060
 be one of those there are a lot but also along the way you meet people who

346
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:58,720
 you already know and sometimes as I say they know basic things and well, but those who go with

347
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,960
 those who are going to learn with them probably do not know anything and if we have

348
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,410
 several cases that have happened like this, that is, there is a person that I always

349
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,860
 He mentioned as an example his name is Cesar Neira, he is a boy that I think he knows

350
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:17,679
 a lot already and it happens that it is Caesar for example in a conference that

351
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,980
 We organized that his name is Lima hat he told me but he only wants to be injected

352
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,309
 sql and but you know well and in how many people who are going to get there

353
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:32,139
 he does not know anything about that and if he finally gets to cheer him up the agreement he knows

354
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,960
 much in his way of explaining things to transmit knowledge is

355
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,789
 great and it served people a lot so everyone has something

356
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,020
 what to contribute and he did it in the sense of community not bone alva and shares what

357
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,620
 that he knows shares that experience and is not expecting something in return

358
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,820
 plain and simple and that's the realm of community spirit

359
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,290
 well we're running out of time so if you want to say a short answer

360
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,170
 to the question carmen location

361
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,670
 yes good because now do not take more

362
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:12,650
 time to rafa that continues with the next talk now they will be moderating this

363
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,990
 person who are not eating at this time in this panel I want them

364
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,050
 to thank

365
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:22,350
 to you for accompanying me for accompanying the entire team of the eco party in doing

366
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:27,090
 this segment with peru so stay tuned we will start right away

367
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:33,340
 with the first one, talk to God, thank you, perfect, thank you
