00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,639
hello everyone welcome to my talk stay

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,040
insane doing bug bounties by mizzy

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,120
shawnee um i just want to say thank you

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
to the event organizers for inviting me

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,840
to do this talk it's much appreciated um

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,280
and thank you for doing great things for

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,920
the community

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,240
so who am i um

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,199
my name is z shawno um i'm a self-taught

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
hacker and i started bug bounties in

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,800
2016 and i actually managed to reach um

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
rank two on a bug mounting platform bug

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,519
crowd from just targeting one program

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,600
now i'm a strong believer that anyone

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
can do this and replicate what other

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,440
people are doing in bug bounties and

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,040
this is exactly how it started for me

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
believe it or not i heard of bug

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
mountains in 2016

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
saw people at the top of leaderboards

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
getting paid um real money for

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,879
vulnerabilities on these websites bug

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,719
bounty programs and i just thought well

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,480
if they can do it

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,680
i can do it so i set about that journey

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,000
i set my goal of getting my first bounty

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,039
understanding how things work and the

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
main thing is

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,360
being consistent um

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
especially if you're doing bug bounties

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,240
full time or you're looking to do bug

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
bounties full time

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
stay consistent treat it like a job

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,119
you're looking every single day whereas

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,759
if you're doing it more as just a hobby

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,080
then that's where

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,439
you're kind of going to look more for

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
the tools automating looking for things

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,400
like that because you're not going to

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
have too much time to dive in really

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
deep because sometimes it might take you

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,040
a good week before you actually

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
understand how the web application works

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
parameters and things like that

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,759
so that's also why i believe sticking to

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,320
the same program is key because the more

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,040
you look at it the more you can learn

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,240
so i'm going to be talking a little bit

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
about my experience doing bug mount ease

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
and giving you some tips and advice on

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,799
basically staying sane

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,560
so i'm in a nutshell because i'm

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
presuming a lot of you listen to this

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
and know what bug bounties are um but if

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,840
you don't obviously you'll learn

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,200
something from this but very quickly i

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,439
mean you spend days researching what's

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
out there and you finally find what you

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,759
believe is a vulnerability

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,000
so you report it you're very happy

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,919
you've written up and you're thinking

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,800
yes hopefully this is a vulnerability

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,239
and then you receive a bounty the

64
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,080
company is really happy you responsibly

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
disclosed it to them yes she was the

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
first person to report it they didn't

67
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,120
know about it they're going to get it

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
fixed you've got a bounty that's bug

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,080
bounties in a nutshell

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,959
is it that simple though

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,200
so some things that you um issues you

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920
may face doing bug bounties are

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
duplicates

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
so this may be from fellow hackers or it

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
may be what's called an internal dupe

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,760
now if you're duplicate uh duplicating

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
against a fellow hacker then usually

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
you'll be invited to the pro um

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
the original report so you can see okay

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
what you duped against

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
now in some cases you won't however it's

82
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
always good to find out what date at

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
least it was submitted because if you've

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
duped against a bug that was submitted

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,879
nine ten months ago and it still hasn't

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
been fixed and it has impact like let's

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
say for example it's an idol where you

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,280
can query user's information or

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
something like that

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
and it hasn't been fixed then

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
if this is a new program you're looking

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,599
at then instantly you can say well do i

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,360
actually kind of want to carry on on

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
this is all the bugs i'm going to find

95
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
just going to be a dupe so already just

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,360
from a little bit of information of

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
duping yeah it's not fun you've duped

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
but if you can find out the date and

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
things like that then you can make a

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
decision as to whether you want to do it

101
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
or not really

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,280
an internal dupe is

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
well if you've i mean i'm i do have more

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,239
information on these i'm just explaining

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,920
a little bit more

106
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,959
about things but yeah internal dupe is

107
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
the company says they found it

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,439
themselves uh from red team exercises or

109
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
whatever they've been doing and yeah

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,920
they found it themselves

111
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
so working as intended so you've

112
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
reported usually it's some sort of

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,599
business logic and vulnerability where

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,599
you can do something that you're not

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
meant to do that well you don't believe

116
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,799
you're meant to be able to do it on this

117
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,159
user account but the company's

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,720
investigating they say ah it's okay work

119
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,599
is intended and you read that and you're

120
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,478
thinking really me sat here as a hacker

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,560
i feel like i can actually take

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
advantage of this and you'd be quite

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
annoyed and yeah it has some business

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
impact usually these type of

125
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
vulnerabilities are working as intended

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,600
have some sort of business impact um and

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
the business is fine for that no

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,520
security impact as such um

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
but company always has the final say and

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,479
i'm gonna give some advice on

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
potentially how you can

132
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
help yourself with that

133
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,120
um and lastly the reporting process so

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
no communication

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
months since you last heard something

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
severity lowered about and again no

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,919
communication why they lowered it um you

138
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
get a lower payout than you expected

139
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,960
even though they advertised like 3 000

140
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,160
for p1 but then they only give you 1500

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,880
and you then have to question why

142
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
and you then have to wait for them to

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
give you a reply and yeah it it can grow

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,000
on you a little bit

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,199
however

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,639
take the bad with the good the good with

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,680
the bad

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,199
and it is possible to create

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,320
opportunities for yourself and bug

150
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,479
bounties because you can do it from the

151
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,199
comfort of your own home um you pick and

152
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,720
choose your own hours when you want to

153
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
work and things like that and the

154
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
payouts can be very very generous

155
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,720
but how do we deal

156
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,479
we want to be able to find bugs report

157
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,240
and be happy so how do we deal with all

158
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,160
three of these and actually stay sane

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
doing doing it basically doing bug

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
monies

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,919
so

162
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,280
just because you were duped right it

163
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
doesn't mean you should give up as i was

164
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,440
mentioning earlier

165
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,160
find out the date date will be key so if

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
it's something that was recently duped

167
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
that i recently found like a few days

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
then tough luck it was just a little bit

169
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
a few days late is that because you're

170
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
not doing it full-time you have other

171
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,840
commitments and things like that whereas

172
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
other people are at their computers all

173
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
the time and things like that then

174
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
consider

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
okay if they're all looking there change

176
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,280
the mindset um and this leads to me on

177
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
saying as well was it a fairly obvious

178
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
finding

179
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,840
before i go on to that though if again

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160
if it was a dupe that was from a very

181
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,919
long time ago then you should question

182
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,560
whether you want to continue on that but

183
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
if it was a fairly obvious finding and

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,639
it was from recent or whatever this new

185
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,160
program

186
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
then you've got to change the mindset

187
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
and be like okay well lots of people

188
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,039
have obviously gone through this program

189
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,960
tested for idols xss and things like

190
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,639
that consider what blogs potentially

191
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,600
people haven't been testing for um and

192
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
look through there but that's where i

193
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
then think and this is why i like wide

194
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
scope programs with lots in scope and

195
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
lots they're a big company bigger the

196
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,039
company the better because the bigger

197
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,319
the company they're more likely to have

198
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,240
mobile apps and things like that for

199
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,960
user experience i mean if you've seen

200
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
the old blizzcon where they announced

201
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,520
diablo on mobile and everyone was like

202
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,759
really and he was like everyone has

203
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,599
phones don't they

204
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,800
um

205
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,880
so i always then think if i've jeeped on

206
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,400
a bug that's on their desktop site my

207
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,319
mindset is okay i'm gonna stop looking

208
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,759
at their desktop site i'm gonna pick up

209
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
my iphone look at what apps are in scope

210
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
and download their mobile apps and see

211
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
what's different and see how the mobile

212
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
app connects to the desktop app i mean

213
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,639
if they have for example like community

214
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,560
posts that obviously you can see on

215
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
mobile and desktop then i want to see

216
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
how different they are and how how

217
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
things work differently basically are

218
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,599
they the same are they literally just

219
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,560
rendering

220
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,120
um a mobile website in this app and go

221
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
from there really

222
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
but

223
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,199
if it is six months plus

224
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,199
then it's in my opinion is worth just

225
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,360
moving on then again if you've spent a

226
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,639
lot of time in this program you have

227
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,400
experience and it's just a one-off type

228
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,599
of thing then yeah but if it's a new

229
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,199
program and you're just starting bug

230
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,759
bounties and things like that and it's a

231
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,599
it's programs that don't bother to fix

232
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,800
vulnerabilities really aren't fun um

233
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,560
so in my opinion it's not

234
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
worth spending too much time on there

235
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,720
whereas again if it's a freshly

236
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,639
discovered issue new scope and things

237
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,319
like that then keep hunting just try to

238
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,400
change the mindset

239
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
not only that but the bog body community

240
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
is so welcoming like everyone's friends

241
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
everyone's friendly they want to talk to

242
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
share ideas and things like that so why

243
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,319
not reach out to other hackers

244
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,080
potentially of who you've duped against

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
other hackers you see on the program see

246
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,039
see what they're talking about on

247
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,800
twitter maybe they've done a write-up on

248
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,319
some issues that might help you on this

249
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,639
program things like that um

250
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,000
there's so much information that you

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
need to gather yourself and do yourself

252
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,479
to actually make bug money's work

253
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,479
successfully in my opinion

254
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,719
you can't just wait you can't just do

255
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,519
some

256
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,839
capture the flags build your rep and

257
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
expect to just receive

258
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
the best invite to search you've kind of

259
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880
got a

260
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,959
network and network is office put there

261
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,720
network is important in bug bounties you

262
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
need to talk to some researchers join

263
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
the discord see where people are hunting

264
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
how people are and what their experience

265
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
like on things um because you might do

266
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,839
on a bug and they might you know when

267
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,120
you reach out to this hacker and they

268
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,760
say oh yeah man i deep on so many bugs i

269
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
got lucky with that one it's not worth

270
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
it and suddenly okay you're gonna move

271
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
on but

272
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
if somebody told me that i'd say okay

273
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,080
maybe i'll come back to that in a little

274
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,839
bit and yeah go from there

275
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,720
so

276
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,399
what about when a company closes your

277
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,560
issue as working as intended

278
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,440
so

279
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
we've had it all happen to us at one

280
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
point um or if you haven't then you will

281
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
do at some point it's usually

282
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
like i mentioned that earlier it's

283
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,839
usually where

284
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
you've found some sort of business logic

285
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
issue

286
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
where

287
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
i mean you've got some sort of user

288
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,560
permission and you can generate some

289
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
revenue that you're not meant to but the

290
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
company says it's fine

291
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
we're not going to bother fixing this

292
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
because we can work see if there's any

293
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
abuse when people try withdraw this

294
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
money to a bank account if they try

295
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
withdraw lots of money then yeah that's

296
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
bad but then you start thinking yourself

297
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
from like the hacker mindset and you

298
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,279
think well if i've got an issue where i

299
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,680
can generate free money for example and

300
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,519
the company says okay we'll test to

301
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,560
they'll make sure they'll check for

302
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
large amounts wouldn't the hacker just

303
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
spread it across lots of different

304
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
accounts um

305
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
but yeah they're interesting cases and

306
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,079
hopefully you don't come across them too

307
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
often um

308
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
you may care honestly about making

309
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
internet secure place and this is why

310
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,519
the company's owned this bug money

311
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,120
programs but in all honesty not all

312
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
companies are on the same page and not

313
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
all of them are running bug writing

314
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,160
programs for the correct reasons um some

315
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
of them have

316
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
seen yeah okay let's open one it's

317
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
something to tick off the checklist um

318
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,240
we're running the bug money program look

319
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,560
we're working we take security seriously

320
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
but in reality you've only actually got

321
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
like two people who are managing things

322
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,000
behind the scenes um and yeah they don't

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
potentially have the time or the mind

324
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,279
they don't actually know security too

325
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,880
well and yeah potentially

326
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,200
things can go wrong now

327
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
in this situation

328
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
uh you see it on twitter sometimes where

329
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,640
people have gone to twitter i've done it

330
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
myself in the past and again this is why

331
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
i wish i knew what i know now and look

332
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,720
back and things um

333
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
it's not good to go straight to twitter

334
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
in my opinion and kind of lose your call

335
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
so

336
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,279
first of all you should always go to the

337
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,800
platform and try and resolve it

338
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
professionally so request mediation

339
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
contact support explain why you believe

340
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
it is an issue and see it from their

341
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
perspective you need to see bug money

342
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,680
platforms as so we've i've seen um tommy

343
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,160
um doggie g um has started his bug by

344
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,240
the union however

345
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,079
you need to kind of see bug monkey

346
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,320
platform support as the uh union so

347
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
you've obviously

348
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
this isn't the case if it's a managed

349
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
program so if you've reported it to a

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
managed program which is managed by the

351
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
platform then it's different case but

352
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,240
i'll mention that in a little bit but if

353
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
it's a case where the company's managing

354
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
itself but they are on this bug making

355
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,720
platform and you believe it is an issue

356
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,920
then

357
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
explain to the platform

358
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
why you believe it is an issue because

359
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,279
the people at these bug bookmarking

360
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,279
platforms they're hackers just like you

361
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,519
and there are so many talented people

362
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,360
working at these companies right and

363
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,959
they can get your issues seen by the

364
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,800
right people they can reproduce things

365
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,279
they can look into the report so send

366
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
off an email send off some messages and

367
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
say hey i believe this is an issue

368
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
explain your reasoning and try and work

369
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,719
things out professionally

370
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,000
now when it comes to going to twitter

371
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
this is where things can get a little

372
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
bit complicated as such so you've

373
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
potentially found an issue that they

374
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,880
won't fix because it's working as

375
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
intended so you you want to write about

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
it i've wanted to do it in the past you

377
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,519
feel like okay well it's not an issue

378
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
but i feel like it's a cool issue i want

379
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,480
to write about it but you're not allowed

380
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
now this is where things can get

381
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,399
a little bit

382
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,079
odd as such because obviously the

383
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,320
company has said no you can't disclose

384
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
it because you've reported to us even

385
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,839
though they've said it's not potentially

386
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,279
an issue

387
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,360
and then the platform obviously has to

388
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
decide usually with the company if they

389
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,760
don't want disclosure so then you can

390
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
feel like the com the platform is

391
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
letting you down

392
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
now

393
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
this is where you just need to see it

394
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
for the way it is right with companies

395
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,279
running bug money programs you've got

396
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,040
company security teams who have had to

397
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,600
go to lawyers and people way above them

398
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
who have had to get approval for a lot

399
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,920
of this right and when you look at scope

400
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,360
and when you look at what they've

401
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
approved and payouts they've had to get

402
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,279
approval for a lot of it honestly it's

403
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,800
taken a lot for a lot of these companies

404
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
to get things going um same with

405
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,360
platforms so just remain calm you've

406
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
explained your issue but honestly you

407
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,720
just need to take on the chin and just

408
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,279
move on because you don't kind of want

409
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,160
to burn bridges and start

410
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
i mean causing issues and things for

411
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,519
that because

412
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,959
networking is very important in bug

413
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,320
bounties like especially if you're

414
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,199
relying on it for income so i've heard

415
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,440
of some platforms if they feel that some

416
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
researchers are what consider consider

417
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
trouble from what they've seen on

418
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
twitter then they may add you to some

419
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
sort of what's called a shadow ban list

420
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,639
where you won't actually receive any

421
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,839
invites and yeah they don't want you to

422
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,440
succeed on their platform as such they

423
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,320
kind of push you out as such so

424
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
yes it can suck it really does suck

425
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
you've reported what you feel is an

426
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
issue but just take it on the chin is

427
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,199
what it is because the good times

428
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
outweigh the bad times in bug mountains

429
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,839
trust me just take a break is what it is

430
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,920
move on potentially if you want to find

431
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,160
a different program but just remember

432
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
the people working at bug money

433
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
platforms they're there for you okay um

434
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
so work with them professionally talk

435
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
with them and try and resolve things

436
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,079
so i just need to have a little drink

437
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,760
so

438
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,199
you've been waiting months for your

439
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,440
issue to be resolved and you're still

440
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,360
waiting to get paid now if you're

441
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
relying on bug mount he's purely for

442
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,839
income so this isn't a side hobby it's

443
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,680
literally you've gone full time then

444
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,279
it's honestly probably time to move on

445
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,120
because three months is a long time to

446
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
get a payout

447
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
now in some cases yes the payout will be

448
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,160
worth it i mean if you look at um sam

449
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
curry's post with apple they waited a

450
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,800
long time but the payout was worth it

451
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
that's where um if you read actually my

452
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
methodology on bugbyhunter.com forward

453
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,279
slash's e sure no

454
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
then you'll see i mentioned risk versus

455
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,480
reward ratio so

456
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,240
with bug mountains you're the boss you

457
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,480
choose the time you choose when you can

458
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,040
hack who you hack on it's up to you to

459
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
kind of make that decision

460
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
there is honestly no holy grail to

461
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
finding a good bounty program it's all

462
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,839
about

463
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,920
what you enjoy hacking on

464
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
literally you want to be able to feel

465
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,399
like

466
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,240
even if you're doing it as a part-time

467
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,120
job

468
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,000
a hobby um you want to feel like i can't

469
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,279
wait to finish work you've got nerve

470
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
commitments i just want to find out more

471
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
about this website web assets they've

472
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,000
got what's out on the website you're

473
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,480
just eager to hack on it now this might

474
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
not necessarily be

475
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,240
bounties potentially you want to hack on

476
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
some vdps and things like that but

477
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
obviously

478
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
with this talk being about bug bounties

479
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,920
it's i don't the only time i recommend

480
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,279
hacking on vdps is to practice or if

481
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,880
you're wanting to literally you're

482
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,040
enjoyable about the scope and i mean

483
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,480
governments for example government

484
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,600
scopes really um they run vdp's usually

485
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,199
but it's so interesting i mean you're

486
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,320
able to

487
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
legally sit here at home and

488
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,839
try and find vulnerabilities and they're

489
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,040
going to thank you for it you've got

490
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
somebody working i mean the department

491
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
of defense u.s department of defense

492
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,639
you've got somebody working at the

493
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,959
department of defense thanking you

494
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
for helping them and jump in it's nice

495
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
it's a nice feeling i get it

496
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
that's entirely up to you but the one

497
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
thing is you have to take everything as

498
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,920
a learning experience

499
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,240
yes you're going to report some bugs to

500
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
bug money programs

501
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,199
that take months to pay dupes et cetera

502
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,560
et cetera but it's all a learned

503
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,520
experience you'll find your balance the

504
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,760
more you do it if you literally try it

505
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,559
for a month and think no i'm not able to

506
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,520
do it

507
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,319
um then jump in the that the rest of the

508
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,079
results are going to show whereas if

509
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
you're consistent and continue trying it

510
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,039
and take everything as a learning

511
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
experience it will make you grow and

512
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,280
you'll soon be able to find a program

513
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
you love

514
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
trust me i've done it before i've been

515
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
through so many bad programs while

516
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
hunting they've just not bothered

517
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
responding to me and things like that

518
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
the payouts haven't been expected of

519
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,919
what i've been expecting so but i've

520
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,760
then found programs which i've loved

521
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
hacking on the scope is amazing and it's

522
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
great

523
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
so

524
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
don't let the bad times

525
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
stop you from continuing bug manage you

526
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,120
might have had a few bad experiences but

527
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,960
there's thousands of programs out there

528
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
there's multiple bug money platforms out

529
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
there now as well

530
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
carry on doing what you love doing

531
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,360
because i actually almost give it up

532
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,559
because

533
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,440
i thought i i felt like i don't know i

534
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
got pushed out a little a bit because of

535
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
things that happened and yeah i don't

536
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,960
know

537
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,039
and honestly i don't want people to go

538
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,760
through that same situation so just

539
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,960
remember

540
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,600
even if you do have a bad experience

541
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,240
it is what it is

542
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,600
try and resolve it professionally um

543
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,160
remain calm and just remember there's

544
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
many more programs out there

545
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,160
so my tips and advice

546
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,320
remember you don't get hired to do bug

547
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
bounties you don't have to have an

548
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,120
interview you don't have to have

549
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,280
qualifications certificates nothing you

550
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
can start right now if you listening to

551
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
this you've never done bug mountainees

552
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
as long as you understand how to hack

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
and you understand websites and website

554
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,480
security os top 10 you know the common

555
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,960
tools being used superb suite

556
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,559
zap proxy tool things like that fiddler

557
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,240
and you understand how to monitor

558
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
requests and you

559
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
ideally you do want a basic

560
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,960
understanding around programming and how

561
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
the mindset of a developer works you

562
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,679
don't necessarily need to understand

563
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,880
coding

564
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,600
but

565
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,160
imagine this a developer has been tasked

566
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,640
to design a feature by this company and

567
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,559
it's to feature a new dog on your

568
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,640
profile so

569
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
the feature he has to design has to

570
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,039
handle uploading the photo adding it to

571
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
this user profile and things like that

572
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,760
so

573
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,799
consider

574
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,880
get a little notepad and consider all

575
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,080
these what i've just mentioned and

576
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
consider what would a developer think

577
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,520
about to make it security um minded what

578
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,120
do i mean how they're going to validate

579
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,559
what i'm uploading how they're going to

580
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,120
validate what um user profile i'm adding

581
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,760
it to and things like that so

582
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,039
you don't have to understand the coding

583
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,160
but you've got to consider what the

584
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
developer may not have thought of you're

585
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
the literally you're the boss when you

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,520
do bug bounties how much you want to

587
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
learn what you want to hack on how much

588
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
you want to hack and things like that is

589
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
entirely up to you

590
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,000
you choose the hours

591
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,799
so honestly bug bounties can be tough

592
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,840
um but it can also be very rewarding so

593
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,919
literally you can go months without pay

594
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,159
because i've had it before where i'm

595
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,520
having a bit of a rough time in bug

596
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,039
bounties because i just can't find a

597
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,880
program i'm looking at

598
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,559
i'm just dipping my feet in a few little

599
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,320
programs seeing what's what i'm trying

600
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
some external programs because

601
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
i haven't mentioned actually a little

602
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
bit about external programs because

603
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,919
it's not just about bug monthly

604
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,080
platforms

605
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
however

606
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
one thing with bug making platforms is

607
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,039
if you run into issues obviously like i

608
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,880
said you've got them to have your back

609
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,840
but

610
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
one thing to mention is there are lots

611
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,799
of external programs out there um and

612
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
yeah they're worth looking at uh i don't

613
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
want this tour to feel like it's just

614
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
all about um

615
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,559
bug money platforms obviously

616
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,880
but yeah so like i say um you may stay

617
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
you may stumble upon literally a nice

618
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,320
paying programs year and with the

619
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,520
payouts that some people receive from

620
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,120
i mean 20k i mean grammarly has a 100k

621
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
payout right now do they not um and if

622
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
cryptocurrency is your thing then

623
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,960
amunify they paid a million dollars

624
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
for one bug i mean

625
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
cryptocurrency is completely new and

626
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
blockchain technology i mean it's not

627
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
new in the sense but it's new in the

628
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
sense that people are actually getting

629
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,679
their head around how things work and

630
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,280
looking for vulnerabilities and things

631
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
like that um and more people are getting

632
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
interested and involved

633
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,679
so it's not a case of you need to find

634
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,640
something every single day because

635
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,919
literally that person that got that

636
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,159
million dollar bounty he's probably

637
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
done he might he's not doing it for a

638
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,600
job that's where it becomes more of a

639
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,360
hobby and he might continue looking for

640
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,799
issues but he's doing it because he

641
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,880
enjoys it um

642
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,200
and that's what bug bounties over time

643
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,720
can actually become

644
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,080
and that's why you'll find a lot of

645
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,159
hunters have actually gone and got jobs

646
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,919
because they don't want to just keep

647
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,760
looking for programs and things like

648
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
that because

649
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,120
it can be frustrating but rewarding so

650
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
just take each day as it comes make sure

651
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
you're always setting goals

652
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
writing notes and things like that but

653
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,600
make sure that you do take some time off

654
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,360
and look after yourself

655
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
but the main thing is to not give up too

656
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,799
soon i've seen like i've seen

657
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,120
researchers who just hack for a little

658
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
while and then they give up um

659
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,200
it's

660
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
when it comes to

661
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,080
hack in

662
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,440
um

663
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
take the website at face value literally

664
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,320
take it at face value and consider what

665
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,919
developers for

666
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,960
but

667
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,799
this talk isn't about hacking and i

668
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,039
don't want to get off track which i

669
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,120
always seem to do

670
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,679
so lastly make friends in the bug bounty

671
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,600
community literally follow people all

672
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,080

made so many friends for life that

685
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,720
i mean i'm never ever going to forget um

686
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,400
the times we've had for example at live

687
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,440
events with ben the hamsek the homie

688
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,840
doggie g

689
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,760
meeting franz rosen for the first time i

690
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
mean i literally i see him on twitter

691
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,600
and followed him and i was like well

692
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,280
stuff he's fine it's really cool how is

693
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,760
he finding this but i always thought if

694
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,120
they can do it so can you um

695
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
yes you're if you're following these

696
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,000
people some people on twitter you may

697
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,159
see like oh they're just sharing bounty

698
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,520
amounts now

699
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
that can either get you motivated well

700
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
okay brilliant nice you're finding some

701
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
good stuff um it's entirely up to you

702
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,520
how you view them personally i like it

703
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,600
when a little write-up comes with it as

704
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
well because it can be like okay nice

705
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,159
nice nice that's cool finding and a very

706
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
nice um

707
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,279
bouncy but obviously i understand people

708
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,559
can't

709
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,520
but yeah let's say follow these people

710
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,159
see what everyone else is doing um and i

711
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,039
also

712
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,960
little plug i mean it's completely free

713
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
but if you visit bug moneyhunter.com

714
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
forward slash public programs um you'll

715
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
also see it on the header bar on

716
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
bugbyhunter.com then you can actually

717
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,559
see which programs are receiving

718
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,799
activity on hacker one which are public

719
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,640
um for example look at the elastic

720
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,360
program you can see since they launched

721
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,039
their last 90-day count has rocketed and

722
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,039
so is the john deere program for example

723
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,640
because while people find it interesting

724
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,080
they want to have a little look at john

725
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
deere's thing it's something that people

726
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,360
are like oh i didn't expect them to run

727
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,799
a program

728
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
but potentially it says to you that

729
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,320
people are having a good time at elastic

730
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,080
and people have continued to report and

731
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,919
things are going really well and maybe

732
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,000
there's lots of you to play with so go

733
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
have a little look see what people are

734
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,000
finding and yeah

735
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,039
so a few things that if i could go back

736
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,880
in time that i wish i knew and could

737
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,840
change as such with my bug bounty

738
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,080
experience um one would be to remain a

739
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,000
bit more calmer as such

740
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,640
um i got a bit annoyed in the past when

741
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
i don't feel like my report was handled

742
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,799
correctly um it kind of burped me a

743
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
little bit whereas i look back and i

744
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,039
should have just been like okay it is

745
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,960
what it is can carry on hacking or

746
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,640
potentially move to another program and

747
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,600
just taking a little break um

748
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
yeah i just wish i didn't i don't know

749
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
yeah i just wish i could do that

750
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,640
um two would be looking back at some of

751
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,480
my old reports it's not showing enough

752
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,640
impact and explaining to the company in

753
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,159
clear detail

754
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,120
why i believe this is an issue and why

755
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,679
they should get it fixed um

756
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,559
which leads me on to say that i felt

757
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,960
like sometimes i was expecting too much

758
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
as such

759
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
whereas now i've got to know some

760
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
companies and things like that and

761
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,559
time's gone on i know that a lot of

762
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
times a lot of people at the receiving

763
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
end aren't up to complete speed when it

764
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,000
comes to like web security um

765
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,080
person who wrote this code doesn't work

766
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,600
anymore and they're struggling to work

767
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
out who owns this code and is gonna get

768
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,760
things fixed and that's why there's

769
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,880
delays and things like that so i wish

770
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,679
that i didn't kind of expect too much as

771
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,679
such and it was more of i mean they have

772
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,159
these um we're gonna reply to you in

773
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,320
seven days and i mean the expectations

774
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,400
and things get set whereas it should

775
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
have been more of a

776
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,880
take it at face value obviously if it's

777
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,600
four months for example then yeah you

778
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,039
know what i mean it's you're not gonna

779
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,120
be happy but if it's been two weeks then

780
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,720
it's fine

781
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
relax you don't need to ask for an

782
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
update and things like that um

783
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,200
it doesn't time obviously if it's been

784
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
two months and what you've reported is a

785
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,039
high so if it's a low bug i get it um

786
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,039
you want to get paid for your bug and

787
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,720
things like that but companies

788
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,520
prioritize um the higher priority bugs

789
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
obviously because i mean they have more

790
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,240
impact um but they do and will pay for

791
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,919
those issues just

792
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,640
give them a bit of time um

793
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,000
and that goes back to what i've said in

794
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,360
the past doesn't it when it comes to

795
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
communication if the company doesn't

796
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,640
really communicate with you and you

797
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
don't you feel like you're talking to a

798
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
brick wall then do you really want to

799
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,360
continue doing that remember you're the

800
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,640
boss and i see companies as your clients

801
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,360
they're joining your company um do you

802
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,279
want to keep this company on as a client

803
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,720
you don't have to fire them you just

804
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,240
stop reporting bugs to them um

805
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,960
and another thing is not explaining the

806
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
repo steps enough so

807
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,080
um i guess i get that again goes to

808
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,679
expecting too much and thinking i've

809
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,039
reported this bug to this company

810
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,480
they're going to fully understand how

811
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,080
things work but

812
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
again things change at companies bigger

813
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
the company more that can potentially go

814
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,320
wrong with old code and not knowing who

815
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,000
owns things not been able to communicate

816
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
with teams things were outsourced third

817
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,279
party owned this things like that

818
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,000
but not explaining to the company or not

819
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
explaining the report clear enough repo

820
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,559
steps and how to actually do this and i

821
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,559
actually wish i added a bit more video

822
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,320
proof of concepts on a lot of my old

823
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,799
reports because i feel like i mean they

824
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,640
was requested a lot of the times i just

825
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
feel like it would have helped things

826
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,919
that goes to me saying doesn't it the

827
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,200
whole idea of bug mountains and

828
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,799
vulnerability disclosure programs is

829
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
they're asking the the world if you find

830
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,760
an issue then you can report it to us um

831
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,080
whereas when you actually do report that

832
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,000
to them a lot of people reporting to

833
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,279
them don't have qualifications

834
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
experience they're not pen testers don't

835
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,880
know how to write reports so they just

836
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,120
write what they want to write but over

837
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,679
experience and time you jump in you pick

838
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,559
up how you meant to do things so one key

839
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,960
thing is making sure that you do write

840
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,000
clear enough reports what what the issue

841
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,120
is and evidence screenshots video proof

842
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
of concepts

843
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,840
so

844
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,720
yeah

845
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,360
overall though i've honestly i enjoy bug

846
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
bounties i've built we've taken some

847
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
time off because

848
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,919
and i mean i i see bugging that at

849
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,000
the top of the leaderboards i've

850
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,679
stuck to one programmes i've had a good

851
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,159
time i've made so many friends had some

852
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,080
live events and i've had a lot of people

853
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,600
ask me well i want to be able to do this

854
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,640
and things like that so that's why i

855
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,279
actually built like bug mighty hunter

856
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,480
and we've got some cool things in the

857
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,320
work again to help some hunters because

858
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,159
i want people to be able to

859
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,840
yeah follow in the footsteps learn how

860
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,720
to do this and learn how to be a bug

861
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,159
bounty hunter as such because there's

862
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,919
thousands of programs out there i don't

863
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,000
see them going anywhere anytime soon

864
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
because they have so much value for

865
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,279
companies in the sense especially if

866
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,799
they're executed correctly and you

867
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,159
engage with the hacker community because

868
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,000
there are so many talented people across

869
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,760
the entire world

870
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,520

talented people out there who can find

879
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880

886
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
