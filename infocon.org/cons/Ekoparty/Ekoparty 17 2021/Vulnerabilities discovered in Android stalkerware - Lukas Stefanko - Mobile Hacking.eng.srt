00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,679
hello everybody my name is lucas and i'm

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,239
android malware and security researcher

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,039
at eset today i would like to share with

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,760
you our research about vulnerabilities

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,680
discard in android style career

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,000
if you thought that social media knows

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,720
everything about you you were right

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,600
however today i will tell you that there

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,160
are apps that know even more would you

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
like to know more

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,559
have you ever been feeling like spied

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,120
upon have you ever encountered strange

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
behavior of a smartphone have you ever

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,760
had a feeling that you know that

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
somebody knows but you don't know how

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
they know

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,920
they might know because they installed

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,879
stalker software in your smartphone

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,199
so what is stalk aware

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,840
simply put it's spying app

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
stalker needs to have physical access to

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
device

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
install the application

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,479
allow all the necessary permissions and

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,960
based on these permissions we can tell

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
what are the capabilities of the

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
software afterwards stalker wear is

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,840
hidden from the victim's view and it

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,479
might impersonate system applications

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,280
such as settings

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,720
where these apps could be downloaded

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,520
from

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
besides shady websites apparently they

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,880
were available even on google play store

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
imposing as a kit or employees price

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
resulting in fact that it wasn't that

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,759
difficult to install them whatsoever

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
precisely eight apps found on play store

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,439
were installed over 140 000 times

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,320
so the number speaks for itself

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,799
based on our data from our android

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,880
client devices as you can see in the

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
slides now

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
these apps have become more and more

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,000
popular in the last couple of years in

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,040
2019 we detected five times more

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
installs as in a previous year

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,360
last year detection increased up to 48

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
we see the popularity still on the rise

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,239
so

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,040
how can we make sure no one is looking

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,280
over our shoulder this problem has been

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,760
discussed and luckily for us it has been

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,520
sold how

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
by using manually or by using manual or

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
static analysis using trustworthy

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
security software that detects informs

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,360
and removes our uninvited cast however

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,319
its enormous popularity made us wonder

60
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,519
and worry about one more problem

61
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,760
who else might be watching

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,040
since stalkerware gathers more private

63
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,120
data about their victims than any other

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,560
app you have installed in your

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,959
smartphone right now

66
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
and i'm talking about the privacy and

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,599
security of victim information that

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,120
might be at risk since such software can

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,159
access

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,360
almost all the sensitive user data

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,599
when we picked one of the most popular

72
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,120
social media application and its

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
permissions to compare with style cover

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,959
it is

75
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
important to say that when social media

76
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,319
requests

77
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,040
a permission um there's option to allow

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
the permission either one time or during

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,879
using the application

80
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,080
contrary stalker where in order to work

81
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
properly all the permissions needs to be

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
checked as a result

83
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,799
the stalker has full access all the time

84
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,080
let's take a look

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
the phone on the right belongs to the

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,159
attacker

87
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,040
the attacker is not a stalker it's a

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,000
person that misuses security issues

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
found in stalker

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
victim and stalker are not aware of the

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,799
attacker or these actions

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,959
the phone on the left belongs to victim

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,439
the attacker sends text message to

94
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,640
victim

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,720
the victim receives a text message

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
text message is then processed by

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,760
stalker wear and it would trigger a

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,879
phone call

99
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
back to the attacker instantly opening

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
microphone spying opportunities without

101
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,119
a victim knowledge

102
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
please pay attention to upcoming slides

103
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
where we will deep dive and share with

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120
you your research we'll focus on

105
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,440
security issues discovered in these apps

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
and then we will close all that with

107
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
responsible disclosure to affected

108
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
vendors

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,040
first thing first

110
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
question questions but from my big

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,160
question where from we gathered this uh

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
the applications the first one is from a

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
github it's talk about indicators of

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,759
compromise at that time there was around

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,880
40

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
um stalkerware apps then the list of the

117
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
top most popular detected style cover on

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,360
our site

119
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,320
paid advertisement pr articles top

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
google search because of that we

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,840
gathered information about

122
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,479
mobile stock aware vendors

123
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
mobile stalker is debated divided into

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
two main platforms

125
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
we focused only on android

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
and the reason is simple the market

127
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
share and the easiness

128
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
of site loading apps on android

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,199
comparing to ios device

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,880
when stalker

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,199
wants to install stalker where an ios

132
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,960
device he need the device needs to be

133
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
either jailbroken or he needs to already

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,759
have icloud credentials and there's one

135
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
more reason why we focused on android

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
from all the analyzed vendors

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
all of them provided solution for

138
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
android but only 37

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,039
for ios as well

140
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,319
so what we did what was our plan i wish

141
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
to analyze 86 or these 86 android style

142
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,039
cover vendors which were represented by

143
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,520
86 different android style cover apps

144
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
we went through

145
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,759
manual static and dynamic analysis to

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,280
observe its behavior capabilities

147
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
also we would like to state a fact that

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,759
this was not a full penetration test

149
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,319
we focus on privacy and security issues

150
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,680
actual impact on their clients victims

151
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,560
or company however the matter is really

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,639
serious

153
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,319
there are some limitations i would like

154
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,800
to go through them first because we

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
haven't paid for any of the software we

156
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
didn't want to support them we were

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
limited by the provided functionality of

158
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
apps and the full accessibility of admin

159
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
panel that is responsible for sending

160
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,360
commands receiving data storing them

161
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
still

162
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
we were able to fully test statically

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
and dynamically 72 apps 14 were limited

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,080
to static analysis only

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
what we are finding our results from 86

166
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,599
apps we found security issues with

167
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,520
serious impact in 67 percent of them

168
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,199
33 percent were bid out serious security

169
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,599
or privacy issue discovered

170
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,680
all together we identified 158

171
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,840
exploitable issues in these apps

172
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,520
now let's jump into particular problems

173
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,479
again

174
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,319
even because of the limitations we were

175
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,039
able to find

176
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,319
158 problems

177
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,479
there were different ones such as leak

178
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
on the network of the personal

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
information out of the victim on the

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,919
smartphone leak on the server

181
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
possibility to frame a victim

182
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,560
remotely control smartphone through text

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,520
message open directory leaks possibility

184
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
take to take over account

185
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,319
live stream from smartphone without any

186
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,759
authentication

187
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
and others i prepared two more video

188
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
demonstrations i will go through them

189
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
briefly

190
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
now let's go through the

191
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
the most serious issues discovered

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
let's start with http leak

193
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
what is this all about

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,479
22 stalker web apps use an unsecured

195
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
http protocol without additional

196
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,560
encryption of the data

197
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,520
um

198
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,879
to communicate with the admin panel and

199
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
let me explain that when stalker

200
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,080
first time installs stalker where in a

201
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
victim's smartphone he needs to either

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,880
create an account or log in

203
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,159
and for that

204
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,479
stockholder used the http protocol

205
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,159
because of that the attacker on the same

206
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,320
network using man-in-the-middle attack

207
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
could intercept the communication and

208
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,200
steal the credentials because of that it

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
could access the admin panel of the

210
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,000
stalker to remotely control smartphone

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,640
of the vector

212
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
besides credentials stall cover could

213
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
also download additional binaries

214
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,720
or modules or updates of themselves

215
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
which are bunny binary files executed by

216
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,279
style cover again attacker on the same

217
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,360
network could replace these binaries for

218
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,519
the malicious one and

219
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,399
trigger

220
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
remote code execution for these binaries

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,560
there was no integrity check

222
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,959
the most common issue

223
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,000
was

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
leak on the network of all the extracted

225
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
data from smartphones such as text

226
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
messages

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
phone call logs

228
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
gallery screenshots and camera phone

229
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
call um recordings etc

230
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
these were leaks on the network now

231
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,959
we'll move to the leaks on the

232
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,720
smartphone

233
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
leak of the personally identifiable

234
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,680
information of the victim what is this

235
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
about

236
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
when install cover processes all the

237
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
commands from the server

238
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
it needs to store the data somewhere

239
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,040
many of the style cover apps would store

240
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
these data on external shared media

241
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
where other apps installed on a

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,839
smartphone with them read the right

243
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,760
storage permission

244
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
for android below 10 could access these

245
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,959
files without additional permission

246
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,440
or any other permission

247
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
in one case stalker aware would store

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
admin token on the shared media and

249
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
because of that any third-party app

250
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
could steal the token excess admin panel

251
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
and then control smartphone of the

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,720
victim

253
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,839
some of the style covers provided key

254
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,320
logger functionality meaning they could

255
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
lock all user input from all apps these

256
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
key logs were not protected

257
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
and accessible to other applications

258
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
and they could lock synthetic

259
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
information

260
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,959
from other applications such as paypal

261
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,040
financial banking applications

262
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,680
including the passwords and the result

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
the takeover is possibility take over

264
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
other accounts of the user not just

265
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
stock aware

266
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,800
most frequently seen in device leak was

267
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
unprotectedly storing and extracting

268
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,399
data such as recording phone calls taken

269
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,680
photos screenshots and in some cases in

270
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
some apps

271
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,760
also calendar events browsing history

272
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
contact list phone number and received

273
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,480
text messages

274
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,320
from the league on the network through a

275
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,399
leak on the device let's move to the

276
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,560
link on the server

277
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
user data leaks through open directories

278
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,440
there are available data such as

279
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,399
weakness photos recorded calls details

280
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,240
about them such as names

281
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
physical addresses text messages social

282
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,920
media messages email addresses these

283
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,000
data were accessible without any

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
authentication for anyone

285
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
during analysis we discovered and tested

286
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,720
that manipulating with victims data

287
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,639
wasn't a problem at all

288
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
many apps used for pairing device and

289
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,880
the server account

290
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,079
unique device id such as ebay number or

291
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,040
android id instead of using server

292
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
generated token

293
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
however these device ids are easily

294
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,760
obtainable

295
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,160
by other apps installed on a smartphone

296
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
there are two impacts or two

297
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,279
malicious cases the first one if

298
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,959
stalkerware

299
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,279
uses http protocol to communicate with

300
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
the server it's possible for the

301
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
attacker on the same network to forge

302
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,560
data being uploaded from smartphone to

303
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,200
server such as text messages to create

304
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,160
custom one text messages photos

305
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,120
to frame a person to make her life a

306
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,800
little bit more difficult or even

307
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
blackmail her

308
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,279
second case scenario of the impact is

309
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,000
third-party apps could get the device

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
ids and then based on the ids upload

311
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
custom and fabricated data to the server

312
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
on behalf of the victim

313
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
in case there is no internet connection

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
some of the apps provided ability to

315
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,639
received sms commands however not all of

316
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,880
them verify if commands

317
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
are received from stalker and because of

318
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
that or someone else and because of that

319
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
anyone could

320
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
remotely

321
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,720
control victim's device by sending text

322
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
message but there are two things

323
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,399
necessary the first one are commands

324
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
for the attacker to know

325
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
these are available on the website of

326
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
the stalkerware the second is a phone

327
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
number of the victim

328
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,200
for that either attacker already knows

329
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
the phone number of the victim or it can

330
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
be extracted by a third-party

331
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
application

332
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
i prepared a video demonstration the

333
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,480
phone on the right belongs to the

334
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
attacker four on the left belongs to two

335
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,600
victim

336
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,920
the attacker sends text message to

337
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,000
victim

338
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
the victim receives text message stalker

339
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
wearer wouldn't process that

340
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,199
and it would trigger

341
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,480
sharing

342
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,560
exact the gps location back to the

343
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,760
attacker or to whoever sent a text

344
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,639
message

345
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,480
of course gps needs to be enabled on the

346
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
victim's smartphone

347
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,199
let's continue with our

348
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,519
ability to start arbitrary components

349
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,399
because of unprotected exported

350
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
components defined in android manifest

351
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,360
it is possible to trigger restricted

352
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
stall cover functionality

353
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,959
as a result

354
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,040
any application installed on the device

355
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,760
could through stalkerware app without

356
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
proper permission or any other

357
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
permission take pictures

358
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
record calls record surrounding audio

359
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,519
take screenshots wipe data enable

360
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,120
disable gps reboot smartphone etc and

361
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,399
afterwards access these data since they

362
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,959
are stored on external again shared

363
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,040
media

364
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,480
what happens when spying ends this

365
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
this is a photo taken by a stalker wreck

366
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
of my ceiling

367
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,279
while it was lying next to me

368
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
unfortunately it is still stored and

369
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,360
accessible on the server even though the

370
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
stalker in this case me

371
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,040
removes data logs

372
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,279
on the link's smartphone

373
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,839
and removes full account

374
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,720
besides my photos are on the server

375
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,760
still stored my text messages

376
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
and my call logs

377
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
in other cases of stalker where data are

378
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,839
not removed immediately when requested

379
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
by stalker but rather it takes 90 extra

380
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,160
days to be deleted

381
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
let's continue with hard coded secrets

382
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,680
this is not

383
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,560
about the token or password as you might

384
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
expect

385
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
rather just server links that are

386
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,399
responsible

387
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,959
to trigger live stream from particular

388
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,199
device where stall cover is installed

389
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
what's this about

390
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,600
in app there are hard-coded links three

391
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,880
links that could through server trigger

392
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,440
live stream from particular device

393
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,360
the only thing that is necessary is

394
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
device id

395
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,160
however these device ids

396
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
are stored on external shared media

397
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,440
by stalkerwear and because of that they

398
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
are accessible to other apps installed

399
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,839
on a smartphone with them read write

400
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,199
storage permission

401
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
i prepared the video demonstration for

402
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,639
that

403
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,639
where on the left side we have

404
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
smartphone on the victim where the style

405
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,560
cover is already installed and then we

406
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,759
have three windows the top one is our

407
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,079
notepad that contains three links

408
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
and we appended device id that were

409
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,600
found in application browser and the vlc

410
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
where we now try to watch a stream

411
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
however this is not accessible right now

412
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
first thing we need to do is to make two

413
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
get requests to server and if the server

414
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
returns through

415
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,520
it means that it would enable a live

416
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
stream from a smartphone without any

417
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,559
authentication to ever request them

418
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,559
victim can't see anything happening on

419
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,720
the smartphone

420
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,359
so these were the the most um

421
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,599
prevalent security issues discovered in

422
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,679
the stalker web apps

423
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,160
after we identified them

424
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
we reported them to affected vendors

425
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
we follow 90-day disclosure practice

426
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,520
by contacting affected vendor up to

427
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,840
three times we contacted the stalker

428
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
vendors through either email or creating

429
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,880
a support ticket through their website

430
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
in two case cases we could not reach the

431
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,200
vendor

432
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,880
without the results of the fixing issues

433
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,320
from

434
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,440
all the affected vendors 10 of them

435
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,600
fix the issues within a 90-day

436
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
disclosure period

437
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,679
12 of the vendors

438
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,039
replied back

439
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
to to our request and promised us to fix

440
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
them but the fix the patch was not

441
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,039
delivered within a 90 days

442
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,320
78

443
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
of the affected vendors did not reply

444
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
back

445
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
or fixed the problem

446
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,960
because of that we decided not to

447
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,679
publish a full list of the vendors the

448
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,679
applications and connect them with

449
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
particular problem security

450
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,799
vulnerabilities

451
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
now before summary let's go quickly to a

452
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
compromise scenario and a couple of

453
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
prevention tips

454
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,919
so when stalker wants to install style

455
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,280
co-wear and a victim smartphone

456
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
needs to have he needs to have physical

457
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
access to device which means it needs to

458
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
know a pin or pattern to unlock a device

459
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,240
and then install side load the

460
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
application allow all the necessary

461
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,240
permissions and then stalker where is

462
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,440
hidden from the victim's view

463
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,760
what

464
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,480
the victim can do before that to

465
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,919
um

466
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
prevent that happening

467
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
make sure to have enabled lock screen uh

468
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
either you spin a password or a pattern

469
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,080
and if you believe someone knows your

470
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,880
pin or got access to your device make

471
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
sure to download install and then scan

472
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
your smartphone with a trustworthy

473
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,440
security software that will

474
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,000
automatically detect detect stalker

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,240
where and gives option to remove it

476
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,160
compromise sign

477
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
so this might tell if you have installed

478
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
stall curve in your device

479
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
there is a higher

480
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
battery drains faster since there's a

481
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,520
lot of

482
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
communication on the smartphone and a

483
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,240
lot of tasks being done

484
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,039
um higher internet consumption again

485
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
there is communication being being done

486
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,840
between the server and the smartphone

487
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,280
gps wi-fi or mobile data might be

488
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
enabled or disabled by itself without

489
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,080
user interaction

490
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
there might be a suspicious

491
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,799
persistent notification a notification

492
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,919
bar most of the time is invisible

493
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
but there is some something something

494
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
there you will notice that

495
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,120
photos screenshots all your recordings

496
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,799
stored in your smartphone even though

497
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,120
they were not done by the user

498
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,960
and there might be or you might have

499
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,440
received questionable text messages

500
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
which means

501
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,559
they might be a

502
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,280
sms commands sent from the admin

503
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,520
so

504
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,799
to summarize number of used detected

505
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,360
based on our data android's talk aware

506
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
has been increasing in the last couple

507
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
of years

508
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,919
style cover apps gather store transfer

509
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,440
transmit

510
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,919
a lot of personal information of the of

511
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,760
the victim

512
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,880
many of them have security issues and as

513
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,320
you saw we discovered 158 of them

514
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,200
unfortunately their vendors don't really

515
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520
care about fixing fixing them

516
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,679
saying something about 78

517
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,640
did not even reply back not to fix them

518
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
we would like to appeal to anyone who

519
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
might be thinking of using such software

520
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,720
to reconsider that using stalkerware to

521
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,960
spy on your spouses it's not just

522
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,159
unethical but it also reveals private

523
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,720
and intimate information about them but

524
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,840
also about those who install it and want

525
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,678
to spy on their close ones

526
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
thank you very much for your attention

527
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,799
enjoy more talks to come
