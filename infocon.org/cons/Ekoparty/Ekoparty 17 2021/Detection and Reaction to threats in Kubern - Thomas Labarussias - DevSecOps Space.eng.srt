1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,960
welcome everybody thank you for being

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,319
here today

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,960
my talk is about detection and reaction

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,919
to

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,440
threats and communities

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,440
thanks to falco and fast system

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,599
so

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,440
go home

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
so it would be should be

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,960
so

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,279
i'm uh tamala barissas i'm currently

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
hessary at comto a french company

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
which offers financial services to

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,760
small and medium enterprises

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,520
this is me on the photo

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
trust me even if i don't have any more

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,960
of the message

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,399
i'm contributor to falco for for

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,920
five years now

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
i'm not a core developer i don't try to

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,559
see prosperous but i'm

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,360
creating some stuff around fargo

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,239
programs blog posts talks

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
and i'm trying to help people

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,879
to help people with

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,719
i'm also the creator of algo psychic

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,440
element we'll see right after

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,480
so

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,479
what's farco falco is a sincere project

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,360
so

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
fully open source

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,159
and

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,119
currently it's uh at incubation level

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,320
and we hope

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,559
to be graduated in 2022

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,880
this is a runtime security project it

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
means it will run aside your

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
applications inside

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
aside your applications inside the

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
community your communities clusters

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,720
and it will detect

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,200
bad behaviors or threats in real time

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,560
so it works basically

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,399
falco has two sources of

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,240
has two sources

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,040
the

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,159
c schools and audit logs

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
for c schools we provide a kernel module

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
or a and any bpf probes you can you

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
don't have to use them

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
the two together just one or the other

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,200
why we have two because

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
at the beginning the canon module was

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,919
created

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,720
but

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
if you are trying to

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,840
enable a kernel module on a manage

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,879
cluster

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,160
on amazon or this or girl or azure

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
it's disallowed

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
for security purpose

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,239
so

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,440
but you can

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
you can often and enable an ebpf problem

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
so basically they are the same they

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
collect the same events the same

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,720
syscalls the the overhead is quite the

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
same between the two of the two

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
you can also

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,959
use the audi clocks from the

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,959
kubernetes control plane

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
to

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
to detect events

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,879
of

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,360
of bad patterns or bad behaviors at the

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,239
happier level of communities

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
above that we have libraries from sydney

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
which which is a company

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
which created fileco at the beginning

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
uh

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,080
rule engine

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
and after we you have the outputs we'll

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,480
see right after

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,239
for people which are not familiar with

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,840
what ciscos are

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
in an operating system you are the

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,239
kernel which is responsible to

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,000
hello communications between your

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,239
applications and hardware

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,640
by hardware i mean

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
memory hard drive

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,319
network

93
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,840
with a network card cpu etc so when your

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,760
applications need to

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,640
write something to file or allocate some

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
memory block

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,879
it your application asks the kernel and

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
the channel will allow it or not

99
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,440
and basically this is not

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,799
direct communication between your

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
applications into kernel the

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
if we see cisco

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,319
like

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,239
in api for the kernel

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,799
we use an sdk uh glypc or muscle for

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,519
helping these regions and

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,080
basically this is the applications use

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,400
this library to communicate to

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,760
to easily communicate with cisco to the

110
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
decision

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
so we have

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
the this called connections library to

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,160
pass them and the woolen jar and falco

114
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
above

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
so this is how it looks

116
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
falco rule

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,479
they are all expressed in

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
the yaml file enamel syntax so we have

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,479
the rule name description

120
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,759
condition we see right after and output

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,320
the output is exactly what you will get

122
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
at the

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
output of falco

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,600
and you can see in in my example i've

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,520
replaced some tokens into you know

126
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
i colored some tokens with light blue

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,400
the the idea is all these elements will

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
be replaced automatically by falco from

129
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,280
intel's it has collected from cisco

130
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
and all these elements are

131
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,880
called output fields in the

132
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
in the json output

133
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,199
you can set up priority and tags until

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,680
the last version

135
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,400
0.30 these tags were not used but no you

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,759
can't find them out in your output

137
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,919
so in the condition you will have three

138
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,400
elements spawn process container and

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
shell products you can use everything

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,919
every elements which are collected by

141
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,639
fargo use user.name for example like

142
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
like you have in the output

143
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
and in this example this these three

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,919
elements are what we call macros

145
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,280
elements we can

146
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,639
reuse

147
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,440
from one rule to another rule etc

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,319
so

149
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,880
just an example of a macro so

150
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,479
for example for the shell products this

151
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,919
is a macro which use product doc name

152
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,120
basic element and a list list which is

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,680
just above

154
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,560
as we know this is not often

155
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,720
easy to create a rule at the beginning

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
the community provides

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,919
a lot

158
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
almost 100 rules

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
to the community

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,120
some are for systems other audit logs

161
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
like you can find out in classic igs we

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,759
have privilege exclamations detection

163
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,520
read and write some sensitive

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
directories of file

165
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,759
interested binaries etc etc

166
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,800
and you can also have rules for audi

167
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
clubs like uh

168
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,880
natasha and exec intro board or

169
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
in my next demo i will show you a rule

170
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
which detects

171
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
if you create a config map with an

172
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
amazon access key include text

173
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,039
this is an example

174
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,240
so we saw for the detection passing etc

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
and for the notification part the output

176
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
we have five outputs in falco

177
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,039
file of the use std out it's useful if

178
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
you are a person collecting logs with a

179
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
3d or 5 bit or else

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,880
shell which is quite particular if you

181
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,919
want to send the json

182
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
to another program through a pipe a unix

183
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,720
pipe

184
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
jrpc which is a bit particular because

185
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,840
in that case the

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
falco is a server and you have to

187
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,960
connect to it with a client and http

188
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
and if you connect your http to fico

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,039
cyclic you you are able to connect file

190
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,520
code to your ecosystem

191
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,599
you can notify your users

192
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,240
with a chat slack materials discord

193
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,440
teams

194
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,000
you can send event into log storage

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
system like elasticsearch loki

196
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,960
cloudwatch logs the queue system kafka

197
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
nuts

198
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,400
etc

199
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,360
falco psychic

200
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
allows you to scrap it and collect

201
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,840
metrics in parameters format about phi

202
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
cosine kick itself of course but also

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,800
about all events from falco

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
by priority parole etc you can wake up

205
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,640
your uncle guys with badger duty or

206
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
abdigini i hope we have victor ops in

207
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,719
future you can store events into s3 or

208
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
else and you can also

209
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
connect farco psychic

210
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,839
and falco sound to a fast system

211
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,640
function as a service system

212
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
so basically we have

213
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,320
n follicles one feldca per node because

214
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,279
this is logical as falco is connecting

215
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,240
cisco as a kernel level and kernel are

216
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
not shared

217
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,720
between

218
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,839
nodes you have to have you need to have

219
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,600
one follicle per node

220
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
this is a classic demand set in the

221
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
in

222
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
the installation of kubernetes you have

223
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
falco psychic you can scrap it to get

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
properties matrix and you in and you can

225
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,680
send

226
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
events in a fan-out mode to

227
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,800
any to

228
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,320
as much

229
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
output you need

230
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,360
and what is useful is with fico psychic

231
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,080
you can filter which output will receive

232
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
your event

233
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,600
according to the priority for example

234
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
you

235
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,839
may

236
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,839
may want to store all events into

237
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,040
elasticsearch

238
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
but you only want to wake up uncool guys

239
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
your sre to

240
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,399
if priority is above critical this is a

241
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
basic example

242
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,399
we also provide a basic ui

243
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,320
really basic

244
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,399
you have to know everything is kept in

245
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
memory right now so we you you just have

246
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,760
one pod for first person ui if you

247
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
delete it you

248
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
everything is

249
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
disappeared

250
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,839
but the idea behind this ui is only to

251
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,360
allow you to see in real time events and

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,920
check if your words are corrected or not

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,440
this is not a long term

254
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
visualization

255
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,519
so falco is in charge of detection falco

256
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
psychic is in charge of notifications

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
and if you connect falco psychic to a

258
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,600
fast system like lambda shubless

259
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
everything you can see on this slide you

260
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,519
have the reaction with these three

261
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,360
elements you have what we called

262
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,320
response engine this is not just detect

263
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,040
something bad happened in your cluster

264
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,480
the idea is to react in

265
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,000
almost

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,560
almost in real time just few seconds of

267
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,040
latency

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
to any

269
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,920
to any event if you want

270
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
if you are interested

271
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
to get more entails about this pattern

272
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,880
and how to

273
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,480
install all this all these softboards

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
with falco psychic

275
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
we

276
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,640
i in the community we created a list

277
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
series of blog posts in the falco.org

278
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
blog

279
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,000
one article per output and we explain

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,560
how to use it with example etc so

281
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,480
let's demo i wanted to do a live demo i

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,839
tried

283
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,440
three times today and but my macbook pro

284
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,639
is burning and i wasn't able to get a

285
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,880
full record at the end it was a

286
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,160
nightmare so

287
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
sorry

288
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,680
i'm just showing you some old records

289
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,920
so

290
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,720
as you can see we have three falco pods

291
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
this is logical because i have three

292
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
nodes in my cluster so one particle per

293
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,519
node

294
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
as you can see one must have two nodes

295
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
two workers

296
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,760
in this example i will create a config

297
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
map

298
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,959
with an access key inside

299
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,240
so

300
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,279
i will call it dash 555 and we'll you

301
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,279
will see here we go

302
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,040
once one falco has detected it so this

303
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
is a json with the output like the rule

304
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,639
we

305
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,920
we had before

306
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,800
with the rule name the timestamp and

307
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,760
the output fields

308
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,839
which are all tokens which has been

309
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,120
replaced in the output

310
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,399
falco psychic is also able to add in the

311
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,720
output fields some

312
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
elements you

313
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,079
you will need

314
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,240
so in the fico psychic ui you can you

315
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
you have pie charts histograms uh bar

316
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
charts and you can filter by priority uh

317
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,479
by four

318
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
if you click on the rule on the

319
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,440
on the bar you will you will find out

320
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,639
uh

321
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
will display the full event with all

322
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
details and as you can see

323
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,959
this event is a

324
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,360
corresponds to the coffee map i just

325
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,320
created 555

326
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
you also have in faculty ui

327
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,719
let me show you

328
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
an event

329
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
a page for events in real time with

330
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,360
we'll see all events

331
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,680
and you can filter by almost everything

332
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,279
you just have to click on badges on

333
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,079
label and you feel you will filter of

334
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,880
course you can enter directly the

335
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
filter you want

336
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,920
so second demo

337
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
that was the correct demo

338
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,639
yes

339
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
so in this demo we'll i will show you

340
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,880
the response engine

341
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,519
so i will move forward

342
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,320
because you know everything about so

343
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
the idea is to simulate a web server web

344
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
website

345
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
i don't know your cms your preferred

346
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
cmas like joomla or

347
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
wordpress drupal

348
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,279
and we'll simulate a web shell

349
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
a web shell

350
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,760
has been spawned

351
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
in the backend

352
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
so i will use basic classic helping

353
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,320
linux and we'll see what happens

354
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,480
so we have falco psychic

355
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,040
with the list of enabled output

356
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,760
the pod is running my website is up and

357
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,320
running and i'm starting a website a

358
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,040
website inside so as you can see

359
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,440
the pod is directly terminated without

360
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,639
any action for myself

361
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
and you can you can find in fico psychic

362
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,079
ui but also in falco laws in falkor

363
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
circuit logs

364
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,959
event which has been

365
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,160
detected

366
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
and in this demo

367
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,079
the remediation the erection is made by

368
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,279
cubeless if you want to know

369
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
you have all details about the name of

370
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
the board

371
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
the

372
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,880
the namespace of the board the product

373
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,639
name the name of the

374
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,880
program which of the process which has

375
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,240
been started by womb vote etc and as you

376
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,480
can see we have the event

377
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
from the cisco the terminal shell

378
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,880
encounter but also the event of the

379
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
exact i've made to simulate the wave

380
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
chain so we have the two outputs

381
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,399
two events

382
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,560
the rest is not useful

383
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
so if you want to

384
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
start with fargo

385
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
we provide

386
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160

to install it in your communities

388
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,320
cluster so we have
