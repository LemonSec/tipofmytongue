00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,680
and learn about patagon aerospace and

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
the work that you're doing

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,360
i think that's awesome

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
title of my talk you all are the folks

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
that

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
i enjoy working with the most um i want

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
to be like you i'm not good at the

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,799
technical side

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
but hopefully the things that you'll see

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
that you'll hear me talk about i will

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
show you the variety of things that are

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,399
going on

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
of getting government and industry

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
to talk to hackers more and some of the

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
work that i get to be a part of so i'm

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
really happy with that and i'm really

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,599
glad to be able to share that with you

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,360
today so

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
i'll jump right into it i'll talk uh for

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,080
a little just a little bit but i'll save

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
plenty of time for questions uh and i'm

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
happy to you know get your thoughts and

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
hear from you all at the end so

64
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,200
uh with that um we talk about aviation

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,280
and aerospace operations and air travel

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
and there's a lot that goes into that

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,120
and uh overall there's a great safety

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
record there's tons of things going on

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
long history that's made

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
air travel so safe for folks

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,440
and

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
and that's the work that people have

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
done over the years and i used to be a

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,879
pilot so i can appreciate that quite a

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,319
bit

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
but now things are changing we're

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
starting to connect systems cyber

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,959
security what you all are talking about

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,640
during this entire conference that's

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
adding a whole new element

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,920
so when you look at what's going on out

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,840
there this is the ecosystem this is

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
everything that's happening and you can

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,599
see it's incredibly complex not just the

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,080
airplanes but the airports the

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
communications the navigation

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
based systems space travel all of those

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,840
things

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
and then all the pieces and parts that

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,799
go into it

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,879
so the concern is the risks are growing

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,840
the more we connect networks the more we

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,120
connect these already complex systems we

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
are we are continuing to connect them

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,799
faster than we can make them secure

96
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,439
and that's the problem so how do we

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
solve that problem when you don't have a

98
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
lot of people with the skills

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
nobody has enough money to do all the

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
things that need to be done so how do

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,319
you get after it and how do you start

102
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
fixing things and and that's what i want

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,879
to focus on today that the changes that

104
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,120
are occurring the attitudes of

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
government and industry

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
and their willingness to talk with

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
hackers and for hackers being willing to

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,880
talk with government and industry

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,600
and so that's what i'll focus on today

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,759
a little bit of background about myself

111
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
uh steve lucinsky as introduced up front

112
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
i've worked in the pri i currently work

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
at the cyber security and infrastructure

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
security agency here in the united

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
states i'm not speaking as a

116
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
representative today i'm here on my own

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,639
time

118
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,840
previously

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,320
i worked in the private sector as a

120
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
chief information security officer at a

121
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
government contractor and before that i

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
had a career in the air force and that's

123
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,199
where

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,600
uh i got into cyber security but a

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
majority of my career was airplanes i

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,160
was a fighter pilot

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
on the left side that's an f-15 that's

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
me and on the right side that's an f-22

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
i had a great time getting to fly travel

130
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,520
around

131
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,000
and the thing that i enjoy most talking

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,919
on this topic is i get to talk about

133
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
flying and i get to talk about cyber

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
security so those are the two things

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
that

136
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
i really enjoy

137
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
these days and you know any chance i can

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
to talk about it

139
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,440
so what i've seen over time

140
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
at the end of my time in the military i

141
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
spent a few years at the pentagon and i

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
remember the

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
opportunities of what i saw and what i

144
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
what was happening

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
in the aviation and cyber security world

146
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,960
i went to defcon 22 in 2014

147
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
that was right after hugo tesso was

148
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
talking about some some hacking things

149
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
he had found

150
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,680
another hacker shortly after that had

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
been talking about and making claims

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,440
about

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
what he had done on an aircraft and at

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
defcon there was a great talk

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
about what could and could not happen so

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
the attention

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
of what was going on in the hacker

158
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
community was starting to focus on these

159
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,520
issues and i had the opportunity because

160
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
of where i worked in the pentagon to be

161
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,280
involved with the policy side of things

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,000
in the department of defense but also

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,199
what it gave me the opportunity to see

164
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
was not only that hackers were talking

165
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
about it and that the government and the

166
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
military was starting to talk about it

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,919
but the industry side was starting to

168
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
talk about it this is a report and

169
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
there's a link at the bottom there if

170
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,160
you want to get a copy of it and read it

171
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
my friend pete cooper wrote this report

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
for the atlantic council which is a

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
think tank here in washington d.c nearby

174
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,560
where i live

175
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,880
and that was the first time that

176
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
industry had published a report

177
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,720
that started talking about aviation

178
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,919
cyber security all that was going on all

179
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,160
the concerns and all the different ways

180
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
that they needed to be addressed and i

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,360
was able to help contribute to that

182
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,919
report and we saw that it got lots of

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,960
attention

184
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
people understood that we needed to talk

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,160
about this we needed to get out there

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,080
and and start addressing these issues

187
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
and having all these stakeholders come

188
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
together to start working on these

189
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
problems

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,199
and that work inspired

191
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,840
uh the things that we did follow on and

192
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,039
so what we saw from a hacker mindset was

193
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
there wasn't enough happening

194
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
of getting government industry

195
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,240
and the hacker community to start

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,720
talking with each other

197
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
even government and industry wasn't

198
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,319
going great and i saw that from my time

199
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
working in government but just the fact

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
that

201
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
how do we get them all to come together

202
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,879
and there's a group that you all may

203
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
have heard of they're called i am the

204
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,919
cavalry

205
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,479
and they have looked at

206
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,759
things like car hacking and car security

207
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,199
maritime security biomedical devices and

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,599
the security of those things and how do

209
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,400
you bring people together to start

210
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
addressing these problems no money just

211
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
volunteers that are smart on the

212
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,440
technical side on the government side

213
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,479
the policy side to get folks together to

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,599
talk

215
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,199
and so they have been a part of the

216
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
community for some time they're they're

217
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
definitely uh they participate a lot in

218
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
besides las vegas if you've ever been

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,599
there uh also on the def con side of

220
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,120
things and for those of you who've been

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
to defcon you've seen the villages

222
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
and and for those of you who haven't

223
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,039
defcon giant conference

224
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
lots and lots of people every august in

225
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
las vegas

226
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
and parts of defcon you can go

227
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
hear people talk about a lot of

228
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,000
different things but the villages are

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
where you can specialize if you want to

230
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,200
spend your entire time at the conference

231
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
learning about car hacking or learning

232
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
about biomedical devices and security

233
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
that is where the villages have set up

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,640
and they're starting to grow industrial

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,600
control systems voting machines just all

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
these areas where you can specialize and

237
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,399
that's what gave us the idea to create

238
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
the aviation village

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
so the first time that we had the

240
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
aviation village was back in 2019 here's

241
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
some pictures

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
and you can see

243
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
we have space on the floor there at

244
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
defcon and we set up

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
in the upper right corner one of the

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
companies that's a good partner of ours

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,800
pen test partners and you're going to

248
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
hear from ken monroe right after me

249
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
they brought in some gear and they were

250
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,480
able to show and let people get hands on

251
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
understand how aircraft systems come

252
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,399
together how they work in the bottom

253
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
right corner that's patrick kiley in the

254
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,959
black shirt who's facing the camera and

255
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
off to the left side of that picture is

256
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,480
the cockpit of a general aviation

257
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,640
aircraft and where he had found a

258
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
vulnerability in a can bus system

259
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
and he had worked with the department of

260
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,480
homeland security and the vendor

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,399
through his company rapid7 to do a

262
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,440
responsible disclosure through vdp

263
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
and then another uh

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,040
activity that was going on at the same

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,720
time right nearby

266
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,440
is that there was a bug bounty for a

267
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
f-15 fighter maintenance system so these

268
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
are the types of things that

269
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,120
we were able to bring together this was

270
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,240
absolutely all volunteers

271
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
from nine months from the time that

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
somebody had the good idea hey let's set

273
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,440
this up let's join defcon we're able to

274
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
bring in military government

275
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,839
industry

276
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
hackers to come in and do talks

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,279
to show their show the research they had

278
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,279
been doing and be able to engage with

279
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,279
that audience and it was a great success

280
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,760
we had lots of good feedback from folks

281
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
and what that led to is follow-on events

282
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
so like i talked about we wanted

283
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,079
government industry to start talking to

284
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,880
each other more and with hackers well

285
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
right after defcon that's the boeing

286
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
plant up in washington state here in the

287
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,839
united states and that's a variety of

288
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,920
folks from defcon and the heirs the

289
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
aviation village at the time who went

290
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,600
out

291
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
got a tour

292
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
and boeing was standing up what they

293
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,279
call their tech council and so now we

294
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,760
have folks who participate talking

295
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
industry and hackers about what are the

296
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
concerns what are the issues so we built

297
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
that relationship

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
another conference that you may have

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
heard of rsa that happens in san

300
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
francisco uh february and march of every

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,279
year

302
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,279
but we were there and while we're there

303
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,880
we're called the sandbox so they they

304
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,480
use that name sandbox but the same

305
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,839
concept

306
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,760
we have you can see right in the middle

307
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
picture at the bottom

308
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
pentest partners built an airbus cockpit

309
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,279
simulator they brought that out boeing

310
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,920
brought out an electronic flight bag and

311
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
so this is where we're able to talk to a

312
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
different audience about the things that

313
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
are going on in the industry what's

314
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
going on what are the cyber security

315
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,720
concerns thinking about aviation and

316
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
space operations as well as

317
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
presentations

318
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,399
it was good that's the director of

319
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
sizza at the time chris krebs in that

320
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,959
top right picture so getting to engage

321
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,560
with these different folks and getting

322
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,639
them to be aware

323
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
of what hackers are doing from a very

324
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,200
simple level and continuing to grow

325
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
those relationships

326
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
that work led to follow-on

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
of course you know with the pandemic and

328
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,680
everybody lockdown and virtual

329
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,160
conferences we did the same thing defcon

330
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,360
last year

331
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
in that upper left corner

332
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
we had a whole range of virtual

333
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,399
presentations and this one in particular

334
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,959
that's pam melroy she's a former nasa

335
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
astronaut two-time space shuttle

336
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
commander and two trips up to the

337
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,680
international space station

338
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
we have a youtube page where you can see

339
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,360
her talk and all the other ones that

340
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
we've given

341
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
hers was great she was talking about

342
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,920
adding

343
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
internet to the space station and how do

344
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
you do cyber security on the space

345
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,200
shuttle so it was great to get her

346
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,720
perspective

347
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,839
we've also in our village been hosting

348
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
the hackasat competition that's being

349
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
put on by the air force and the space

350
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
force as another way to

351
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
give hackers a really special capture

352
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
the flag event that's based on space

353
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,519
systems and how it's continuing to grow

354
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,200
and give challenges they're going to do

355
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
their second

356
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,720
hack hakusat it's happening right now so

357
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,800
they had the preliminary rounds and

358
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
they're gonna have the finals coming up

359
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,680
here in december so you'll be able to

360
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,079
watch that online uh but at the same

361
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,680
time that we've been doing these things

362
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,760
in the village what we're seeing is

363
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
across government and industry

364
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,600
more effort more energy is going into

365
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,720
this

366
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
the aci is the aviation cyber initiative

367
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,959
and that's a agreement and work being

368
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,600
done within the u.s government between

369
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
the department of homeland security

370
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,480
department of defense and the faa

371
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
and so it's good to see that they're

372
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
coming together working they have also

373
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
built a community of interest of folks

374
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,120
outside of government so hackers can

375
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
come in and they can participate in

376
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
quarterly events hear speakers and join

377
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
their activities

378
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,399
also we've seen the world economic forum

379
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,720
they are publishing more and more about

380
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
cyber resiliency and concerns in the

381
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
aviation sector some other events that

382
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
have been happening in the united states

383
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,480
hack the airport multi-day event

384
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
sponsored by women in cyber security so

385
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,440
these things are starting to grow not

386
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,160
because of us but at the same time and

387
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
so what we like is that we're able to

388
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,880
help connect and bring people in and

389
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
support these different events which is

390
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,880
why i was so happy to learn about what

391
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
juani's started

392
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
with the patagon aerospace and then

393
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,480
being invited to this event so

394
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,720
these a lot of these things are us

395
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,600
focused we have uh within the village

396
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,279
we're not just u.s based we have a lot

397
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,680
of u.s members but we also have folks

398
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,079
in the uk in japan and i hope you all

399
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,519
decide that if you want to join our

400
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,399
efforts

401
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,240
we're happy to have you but

402
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
it's good to see how these are these

403
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,160
things are continuing to grow

404
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
and so what that allowed us to do is

405
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,680
we've been involved in other events

406
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
especially while it's been virtual so

407
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,320
much

408
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,199
aia if you're familiar with that

409
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
they do a lot of academic work so we're

410
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
speaking at events matter of fact in a

411
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,880
couple of weeks i'll be out in las vegas

412
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
speaking at one of their events

413
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
in the united states there's an event

414
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
called gray hat it just it's also the

415
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,079
texas cyber summit so you may have heard

416
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,680
either one of those names

417
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,839
blacks and cyber another event that's

418
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,800
been growing so these smaller events are

419
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,639
continuing to happen and we're able to

420
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
support those as well as being back at

421
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,480
rsa and at defcon last year

422
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
rsa was all virtual but defcon was great

423
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
in the sense that it was both virtual

424
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,600
and in person so again that allows if

425
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,120
you can travel you can go there in

426
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
person now

427
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,199
or i'm hoping that they'll continue

428
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,720
doing the virtual components so if you

429
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,600
can't travel you can still participate

430
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
so like i mentioned what we're seeing is

431
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,279
this overall change of what we've been

432
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,600
able to do as a village but the overall

433
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
change in attitude where initially

434
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,759
government and industry

435
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,759
they barely would talk to each other

436
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,920
that's gotten much better but what's

437
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
really great to see

438
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,279
is how they're starting to talk to

439
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,880
hackers more

440
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
they're willing to engage they're

441
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,079
willing to bring in those different

442
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,040
perspectives because they know you have

443
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,000
the skills you have a different way of

444
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
thinking a different way to solve

445
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,880
problems and to get after and fix things

446
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,360
so it's really nice we continue to get

447
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
invitations to join

448
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,079
the caa is over in london they are the

449
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
the uk's version of the united states

450
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,360
and the faa that deals with flight

451
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,000
safety and things of that nature and so

452
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
from an international perspective

453
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
continuing to engage with those

454
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,199
organizations aia again speaking events

455
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,280
coming up we're already planning for rsa

456
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,359
that's coming up next february so if

457
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,959
that's an event that you go to please

458
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,119
come by and see us and of course we're

459
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,679
already thinking about defcon so even

460
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,000
though that's not until next august

461
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
we're already planning because we're

462
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,760
glad that we're going to be fully back

463
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,039
in person

464
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,720
we want to make sure we're bringing in

465
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
the right content the right activities

466
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,039
and because of the work that's been

467
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,640
happening because of these changing

468
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,520
attitudes and the willingness to come in

469
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,840
we've got folks we had a class last year

470
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,720
about air inc 429 that had lots of

471
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,559
attendance we're going to bring that

472
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,760
back

473
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,160
i think boeing is considering bringing

474
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
back their electronic flight bag and

475
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
letting people learn more about those

476
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,880
systems the folks from the space force

477
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,799
and the hackasad they are bringing in

478
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,360
flat satellites so you can get in there

479
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
and you can learn how those work

480
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
we're also talking to one of the us

481
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,679
airlines that wants to do more work with

482
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,480
the village they want to bring folks in

483
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
the security researchers and the hackers

484
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,280
to help them find vulnerabilities to

485
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,600
help make their systems more secure so

486
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
again the benefit of all these things is

487
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
that it continues to grow and we're

488
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
seeing that happen and defcon's a great

489
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
place uh where that's you know bringing

490
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
all these folks together and the success

491
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,520
that's happening there uh for you know

492
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
not just u.s but again from that

493
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,520
international perspective of bringing

494
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
folks in

495
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
so with that i said i wouldn't talk too

496
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
long i wanted to give time for questions

497
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,520
but i want to make sure that you all

498
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,400
know that's my contact information on

499
