1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:02,720
welcome

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,000
thank you for taking time to um come

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,480
hopefully learn something new or

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,719
bring maybe a little different point of

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
view uh i will be walking you through

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
everything we are hearing a lot about

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,439
industry 4.0 smart this smart debt

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,400
industrial iot um

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,199
normal iot being added to industrial

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
networks so i'll walk you a little bit

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,480
through um

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,720
what are the industrial environments uh

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,920
what are

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,160
the uh the representation if they are um

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
suitable for for what is actually

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,920
happening i walk you a little bit

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,079
through the changes that been happening

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,039
on the industrial side of things um

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,640
and then i'll tell you a little bit

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,879
about maybe how to protect them so what

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,440
are some of the um

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
things that you can advise to your

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,440
customers or for you to understand a

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,039
little bit better um how to

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,359
work in these

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,840
evolving environments i would say

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
so

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
let's have a look at it

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
as i mentioned this is the title of the

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,880
talk so i'll walk you straight to who i

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
am my name is sharka um i actually

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
started working more on the defeats of

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
defensive side of things um

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,920
i started uh in a team protecting

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
critical national infrastructure then i

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
moved to more the offensive side of

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
things where i am right now um i am

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
involved in anything that's from social

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
engineering physical security uh as well

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479
as uh industrial control systems i'm

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,920
teaching

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,200
a lot

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,680
um not only about that but i'm also

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
involved in everything that's health

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,159
care in cyber security i lead a team for

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,479
biohacking village uh which is a village

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,560
that's all about uh cyber security and

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,040
health care so come and play i have

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,079
amazing team that are great creating uh

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
amazing challenges

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,200
so i work for dreamlab technologies so

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
um

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,920
i think

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
one thing that i would definitely point

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,639
out is important these days to have a

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,879
partner who's neutral in the cyberspace

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,360
so i think that's one of the advantages

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
um and you might be probably

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
like familiar or more on the latin side

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
of things where we have a lot of our

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,640
colleagues

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,959
and very smart people

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,720
and uh we've been around for a while um

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
you can see it here uh and it obviously

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
led also in our involvement in

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
everything that's on the ot side of

67
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,440
things in terms of partners but also we

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,280
have our own um research team as well as

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
doing the trainings as i mentioned

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
so

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,920
what are industrial environments how do

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
they look like what is actually changing

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
but i would start with something that i

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
want to set a little right um

75
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,560
smart in terms of smart is not exactly

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
correct i would say so um i would say

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
let's get this right and i would rather

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,640
say

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
smart in this case would be connected so

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,280
i think it's important to uh actually

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,519
when you're talking to customers

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,280
they might not be aware because the

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,480
smart notion might be misleading so they

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,920
should understand that instead of

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
thinking of it as a shortcut of making

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,080
things easier it actually is bringing um

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
connectivity which is good but it needs

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
to be done in the smart way and i'm that

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
is the word that i'll be using for smart

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
smart smart but in this case it would be

91
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
connected devices and they need to

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
understand uh all the vulnerabilities

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
that come with it so

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,280
what are

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
ot or

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,959
ics because

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
ot the operational technology is

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,959
everything it's umbrella

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
word for um

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,200
uh industrial control systems as well as

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
scada

102
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,239
and a distributed control system so

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,760
where do we find them we find them

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
anywhere from uh processing our food

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,840
manufacturing plants making our medic

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,280
events uh

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,160
but it also could be a car manufacturing

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,798
um as i mentioned uh

109
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,960
i am partially working on the healthcare

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
side of things and that this my big

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,759
passion is actually the cross-section of

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,600
industrial control systems with

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
healthcare so that would be for example

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,800
your hospital hr system that is ics that

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,280
is in healthcare environment connecting

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
two very vulnerable

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,600
environments together um

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,759
oil pipeline that might be another

119
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,400
industrial control system a water

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,520
treatment facility or power or nuclear

121
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,479
plant

122
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,440
so

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
these environments the way that i'm

124
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
putting it there is a reason because for

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,280
most of these environments we have seen

126
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,160
attacks in in the last couple years uh

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
when we are talking about car

128
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
manufacturing uh there was a e concern

129
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
somewhere that was uh

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,520
started end of 2019 and we've seen it uh

131
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
hitting big in

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
the first half of 2020 and for example

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,240
honda had to shut down their

134
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
manufacturing plants all over the world

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
for some time

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,560
because

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
it can't ransomware is actually one of

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,600
the first um in reality is second first

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
was megacortex but megacortex didn't um

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,759
didn't go as big so ikan sonsware is

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,360
considered to be one of the first

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
ransomwares that are actually targeting

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,759
um industrial control devices because

144
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
most most of the time um for example the

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
our next uh

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,440
example i will give in a minute it start

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,080
it sort of attacks the

148
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
the i.t part of things and then somehow

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,039
gets to the industrial network but econs

150
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
it's actually when it gets uh to the

151
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
network uh on its skill list are uh all

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
the processes that are related to hmi

153
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,479
hmi is your human machine interface this

154
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,759
would be

155
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,360
in your

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,400
plant

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
there is this

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
screen where you're seeing everything

159
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
that's happening on on the the in the

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
plant so all the processes that are

161
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
happening there you have all the data

162
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,479
there um you could see it sometimes with

163
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,479
like a big red button in case something

164
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
happens you can stop it straight away

165
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
that's your hmi or human machine

166
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
interface your window into whatever is

167
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,840
happening in the processing plant and

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
that's what they were uh

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
targeting because obviously if you shut

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,360
down

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
the

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
like their view into the the processes

173
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
whatever is happening there they can't

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,479
do anything so uh that was the ekanson

175
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,319
somewhere as i mentioned the second one

176
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
is the ransomware too so there was a

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
colonial pipeline ransomware attack

178
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
that's

179
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
four three four months back

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,560
uh so there was a dark side group uh

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
which is ransomware as a service group

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,919
uh that attacked them uh unfortunately

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,080
colonial pipeline

184
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,960
it's about 45 percent of the east coast

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,599
fuel and so that's your everything for

186
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,000
your car all the way to jet fueler and

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
military supplies

188
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
out

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,840
um so there was more um that didn't

190
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,800
target exactly the uh that came through

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
the i.t side of things

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
another one uh was so when we were

193
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
looking at the water treatment facility

194
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,240
so what did you facilitate in florida uh

195
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,479
the attack was uh i believe a

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,039
disgruntled employee who connected

197
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:45,919
through

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,280
teamviewer

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,479
to hmi remember that's your the window

200
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
into your uh processes so we've

201
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
connected uh remotely to that and

202
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,759
changed the chemical that's used for

203
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,520
cleaning the pipes

204
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
uh and it's checked the person changed

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
from 100 parts uh per million to 11

206
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
hundred parts million

207
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
what it means if it would not be caught

208
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,560
that means that the person would poison

209
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,680
the people

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,039
so

211
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,520
we are seeing the growth of attacks on

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,240
these environments and it's well

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
we we obviously we're more familiar with

214
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
the nation side of things so like

215
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
stuxnet and the attacks on the power

216
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
grid and ukraine by recently we are

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
seeing more um

218
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,919
more of a a criminal approach in

219
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,519
attacking these environments because

220
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,360
obviously it's an environment when if

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,839
they attack it they most likely will

222
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,279
want to pay to to get it back up

223
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,040
so

224
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
this

225
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
is the representation of of uh the usual

226
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,320
representation of uh these environments

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
so this is your

228
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
computer integrated models the same or

229
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
purdue model this was created in 90s so

230
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,279
1990

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,880
and it represents this uh uh automation

232
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,959
pyramid and the idea is so on your

233
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
level zero you have your production

234
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,440
processes uh then on top of the

235
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
processes so let's say process is some

236
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,839
mixing chemicals on top of the process

237
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,240
so that on the level one you have the

238
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,800
sensors and actuators so that's whatever

239
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,560
sensors are sensing whatever is

240
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,279
happening there uh then on the first

241
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
level uh that's your sensor on the next

242
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,000
level uh you would have a

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
plc so then it's um

244
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,880
communicating it's like plc it's

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
programmable logic control that's like

246
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,839
your um like an industrial computer very

247
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
simple there is something programmed so

248
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,120
when it senses uh it sent it sends to

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
the plc the plc then uses the actuator

250
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
so you have sensors and actuators um so

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
they could be like your valve with

252
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
the chemical that needs to be added so

253
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,560
then you have the process uh

254
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,920
the sensors actuators plc's uh then on

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
top of that you have the hmis your human

256
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,440
machine interface so it sees

257
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
whatever is happening below that we just

258
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,640
discussed

259
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,519
then we

260
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
would have for example um a historian

261
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
that's your database so that's every all

262
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
the the data about everything that's

263
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
happening that's usually uh being

264
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
replicated for example in um

265
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
because the the the level three so then

266
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,040
you would have between that level three

267
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
and four you would have usually dmz so

268
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
it could be replicated in a

269
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
one-way fashion where it should be

270
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
and then it could be sometimes even

271
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
replicated on the it business side which

272
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
is the top of the pyramid that's your

273
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
level four

274
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
by the way sometimes you might see

275
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
five levels it differs

276
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,160
why and that's or where i'm trying to

277
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
get this pyramid is supposed to tell you

278
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920
that

279
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,320
this is a way how to also secure things

280
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
or this is your uh uh threat modeling

281
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,760
because it says uh to use uh

282
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,640
security controls uh in security and

283
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,720
depth on every layer as well as uh most

284
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,640
of the um

285
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
attackers would come from the iit side

286
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,240
so from top of the pyramid

287
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,120
does that really represent what is

288
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,240
happening since the 90s because um we've

289
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
been uh progressing quite a lot and

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,320
we've been adding lots of these

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,480
connected devices right

292
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,760
so

293
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,600
i would say it looks

294
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,040
maybe

295
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,440
more like this because we are seeing the

296
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
convergence of the it and ot that the

297
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
lines uh

298
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
between themselves are blurring it's

299
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
it's like the pyramid it's not exactly

300
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,279
the representation of it because we are

301
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,720
seeing more uh heterogeneous and complex

302
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
environments because all of these

303
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
different devices that are being added

304
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,240
to obviously

305
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
make it work better or have better

306
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
overview whenever whatever is happening

307
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
so

308
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,440
it versus ot uh so it we know right

309
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,959
that's your

310
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
uh these are your computers and servers

311
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,959
and and it has all these firewalls and

312
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
antiviruses with the protocols

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
https ssh

314
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,480
on the ot side of things we are seeing

315
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
less screens we say it's more industrial

316
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
um but we in terms of devices it all of

317
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
a sudden it's it's plcs your

318
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
programmable control or sensors or

319
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,040
actuators and

320
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,680
also in terms of the protocols uh

321
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,920
we have protocols like modbus s7

322
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,600
profinet

323
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,320
and these

324
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
lack a lot of security controls um

325
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,959
so the approach has to be different

326
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,880
because we can't be

327
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,200
protecting and securing the these

328
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,519
environments in the same way

329
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,600
so

330
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
what i've been trying to get to is that

331
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,279
perhaps the sim or the preview model

332
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,320
that is still being used this as like a

333
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,519
reference architecture uh everywhere is

334
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,920
perhaps not completely right because i

335
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,959
would say it's your ics from 90s

336
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,760
um

337
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,040
so it is hierarchical uh

338
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
hierarchical hierarchical

339
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,160
there is this hierarchy in the uh in the

340
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
levels um

341
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
and so it's not

342
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,600
exactly working the the um

343
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
lately because we are seeing for example

344
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,600
everything that's like your cloud-based

345
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
big data analytics for

346
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,360
we need uh predictions right so we need

347
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,399
the raw data from the lower levels of

348
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,399
the automation permit when we are

349
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
talking about the pyramid um

350
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,760
so

351
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
we need then we are connected to that

352
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
and it's being directly uploaded to the

353
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,760
cloud and it's not um

354
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,120
then the

355
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,440
as i mentioned that the the assumption

356
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
when in the secret of this

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,800
is that the it's the top level it's

358
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,560
where the um

359
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,279
where the threats are coming from but we

360
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,000
are seeing more network network flows

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
and that are also traversing the

362
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
different levels at once they're just

363
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,079
like skipping them

364
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
uh we are seeing more complex um

365
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
deployment which obviously again

366
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
connectivity

367
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,760
uh

368
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,800
usually

369
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
means increase

370
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,440
of vulnerabilities uh and we are also

371
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
seeing more um

372
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,320
uh

373
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
technologies like wireless portable

374
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,639
technologies because for example uh when

375
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,000
i was talking about the the plc uh the

376
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
uh um equivalent of plc sort of the same

377
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
function is rtu that's your remote

378
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,160
terminal unit but for example rtu would

379
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
be something that you put in an

380
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,600
outstation somewhere um electrical on

381
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
station where

382
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,880
it would be connected via wireless it

383
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,639
would be uh using a solar uh uh

384
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,440
solar it would be solar-powered so it's

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
all these new technologies that it's all

386
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,199
of a sudden the the

387
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,720
attacker is not exactly gonna come from

388
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,120
the top of the pyramid so the pyramids

389
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,079
sort of like um not working in the in

390
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,360
this matter

391
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
then we are also talking about new

392
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,279
technology so um there is tsn so that's

393
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,000
your time sensitive and networking so we

394
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,720
are um there is uh ieee a working group

395
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
that's proposed this uh

396
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,759
set of uh new um

397
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,600
ways how the uh not only the industrial

398
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,399
networks could work but that would mean

399
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,440
it's actually speeding up uh in terms of

400
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,000
in terms of the tsn actually uh

401
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,399
currently there is only t uh profinet

402
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,240
and opcua then that implemented it but i

403
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,399
still wanted to mention it here and to

404
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,519
explain you i think i like to really uh

405
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,560
um

406
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,279
explain it on this profinet part because

407
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,399
it shows nice um actually going from so

408
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
currently

409
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
most of the

410
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,759
typical profinet uh

411
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,440
so profinet is suite of of a different

412
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
protocol so for example your io profinet

413
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,320
that's your input output that's your

414
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
peripherals so that would be a protocol

415
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,079
that you're using for your plcs or rtus

416
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
but there is also uh

417
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,040
the alarms and records so it's this

418
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,120
suits but this one is using tcp udp

419
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,079
and it's for non-time critical tasks

420
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,319
because that means since they are using

421
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
ip based communication

422
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,720
there is it's not exactly sw suited uh

423
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,839
for

424
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
time critical tasks so what happens then

425
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,199
then i want you to look the next next

426
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,000
part is the rt irt and the tsn we are

427
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720
working towards the tsl so rt uh

428
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,919
profinet rt is the profit real time

429
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,960
so

430
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
but it doesn't stop there in real time

431
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
actually irt which isochronous real time

432
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,799
so that's for high speed motion control

433
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,640
application so that's

434
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,360
sort of like the the newest um

435
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,120
the most of like the fastest uh way of

436
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,200
using this because the asynchronous one

437
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
uh

438
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,200
is using

439
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
um

440
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
there is lots of less collisions uh

441
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,320
that's how it was built

442
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,400
but so it employs the irt and rt for

443
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,799
real time channels so that's uh when we

444
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,120
need something that's time critical

445
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,280
application because

446
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
what you're seeing is actually skipping

447
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,640
the tcpa ap layers and so it's avoiding

448
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,280
that that's time and

449
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,919
that communication on the protocol stack

450
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,640
so

451
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
then we are moving towards the tsn

452
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,039
in reality as i mentioned profinet and

453
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,440
opc ua we're the only ones that have

454
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,720
implemented but it's not exactly

455
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
there yet

456
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,679
uh because it has to be properly

457
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,679
implemented in all the components you

458
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,720
can for example use the the tsn uh

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,840
profinet devices with non uh tsm

460
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,039
profinet devices but you uh will not

461
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,240
benefit

462
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
completely the whole network from tsn so

463
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
it's not there yet it's sort of like

464
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
where it's going and where i'm trying to

465
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
get to is

466
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,039
then the the automation

467
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,440
pyramid it's probably not the best

468
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
representation for

469
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
how this network will look like

470
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
i

471
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,799
really like the approach of

472
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,400
mondrian and tableau so uh i will

473
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
explain a little bit about that it's a

474
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,039
research that was published um last year

475
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,520
was mondrian and tableau

476
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,240
is this year so it's uh these are the

477
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,240
new architecture so mondrian uh is the

478
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,720
uh architecture for enterprise or it

479
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
networks and they they took it and on

480
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,760
top of it built a tableau which is the

481
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,240
one for ot network so

482
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,720
mondrian is actually a

483
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
a painter painter

484
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
uh

485
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,919
from i believe netherlands uh tableau is

486
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,160
actually one of his uh the the art

487
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,400
pieces that he did someone must

488
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,240
like him very much um so

489
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
why did they um

490
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
why did they feel the need to actually

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
first build this this flat zoning

492
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
architecture that you're seeing here on

493
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
the mondrian side of things because the

494
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,240
even the itv infrastructure is becoming

495
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,840
a lot more

496
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,760
hybrid and uh

497
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,559
very heterogeneous and very complex

498
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,360
so

499
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,480
this

500
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,600
then

501
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
needs a different approach than how it

502
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
has been and

503
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,679
actually that sounds a lot like the the

504
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,480
ot environment that we just talked about

505
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,600
keep the whole to the thought because um

506
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
that is uh

507
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,640
actually why they then use mondrian to

508
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,960
to use tableau or the

509
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,799
on the ot side of things so

510
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,200
what you are seeing uh you're seeing the

511
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
the mondrian partitions

512
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,440
uh then uh

513
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,600
in to the zones that are like seeing the

514
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
zone one so two so it partitions the

515
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,559
network into these collections of flat

516
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,799
zones uh and as you can see on the

517
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,760
picture uh each of oh maybe it's here

518
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,640
for you

519
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,679
each of the um each of the zones it's

520
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,600
connected to this designated security uh

521
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
uh gateway that they are calling tp or

522
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,120
transition point so the zones are

523
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
connected to these transition points

524
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,159
um and then the same logical zone like

525
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,200
you're seeing

526
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
the zone 102 or zone three uh it can be

527
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
uh

528
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,480
distributed across um different branch

529
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
sites for example here you are seeing

530
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,520
the zones one and three being

531
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,080
distributed across a main data center

532
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
and the branch site

533
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
so

534
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,880
the next part that i want you to sort of

535
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,080
focus on

536
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,320
is actually the main building block of

537
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
this concept and that is this inter

538
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
domain that is happening between the uh

539
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
the transition points

540
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,799
so

541
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,919
i will

542
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,360
talk to you a little bit about that in a

543
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,760
minute uh actually in the paper i really

544
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,840
liked um this

545
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,039
more up-to-date purdue model

546
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,840
so because here you're again remember i

547
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
told you sometimes it's four sometimes

548
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
it's five here they have actually five

549
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,159
layers um but it uses also the external

550
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,120
offices that are then on sort of uh

551
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,158
connected uh to the whole model so

552
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
since in the standard mondrian

553
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
deployment so remember that

554
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,679
the flood zoning all the network zones

555
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,039
uh are connected to the same uh tp the

556
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,799
transition point remember there were

557
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,880
these two ptps

558
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
so then it's connected to the internet

559
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,400
uh and as we saw before this results in

560
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,440
a flood zone architecture so how do you

561
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,200
um

562
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
how do you translate this this flat

563
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,039
layout uh to what actually purge your

564
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,120
model is very hierarchical right so we

565
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
have a look

566
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,840
now this this is a proposed uh tab

567
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,240
that's the the final the tableau

568
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
um proposed architecture uh based on the

569
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
mondrian so the tableau then splits the

570
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,360
network in the multiple device or host

571
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,080
zones uh you're seeing that every host

572
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,799
or device zone is um a

573
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,000
guarded or uh has the mondrian uh

574
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
transit point um

575
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,200
and

576
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
uh

577
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,080
then

578
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,720
it's on the at the edge of uh each of

579
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,919
these zones so then uh when the traffic

580
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,200
leaves the zone the tp then encapsulates

581
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
it uh and then uses an encrypted and

582
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
authenticated tunnel and forwards the

583
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
traffic wherever it needs to go so

584
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
some of the differences that you might

585
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,480
see here is for example it merged the

586
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,559
purdue levels and placed the field

587
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,840
devices

588
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,080
which are your sensors and actuators

589
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,480
remember um

590
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,919
place them into one with uh with the

591
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,880
controllers so that would be your plc

592
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,679
uh

593
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,600
why because the

594
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,159
the communication between is uh is very

595
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,880
critical so they uh they put them to

596
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,919
together

597
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,400
uh also what is

598
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
new uh is the integration of the i.t

599
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,440
zone so you're seeing the office office

600
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
on the

601
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,840
on the on the right side of the

602
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
right side of the picture

603
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,679
so

604
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,559
since the mondrian was originally

605
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,480
designed for um it networks it obviously

606
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
we can include them so it's adding the

607
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,240
the i.t zone just as another um

608
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,440
another

609
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,559
well here we call them host uh or device

610
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,400
zones but it's just another zone right

611
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,080
so uh it it sort of works like a

612
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,279
lego

613
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,840
same as including the office zone just

614
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
as another episode we're going to be

615
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
talking about remote zones so for

616
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
example when we have scada

617
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
uh that's

618
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,240
scada is normally spread across uh

619
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,760
geographical locations so uh in this

620
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,919
case it's great because you can add the

621
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,200
different

622
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,799
let's say it's a water treatment

623
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,440
facility or outstations you can add them

624
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
just as a remote zone to to this

625
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,799
infrastructure um to this

626
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,640
representation or this new kind of

627
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
architecture model so i think we are

628
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,840
moving towards people understanding and

629
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,200
proposing new ways how to um

630
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,919
how to shape the system and this is not

631
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,919
only how to build them but this is also

632
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,559
how to approach all the um all the

633
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,760
security so

634
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,240
how smart is the industry 4.0 so i will

635
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,480
explain you what actually industry 4.0

636
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,360
mean

637
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,480
uh and how we got here

638
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,360
uh so first we had the first industrial

639
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,039
revolution what you're actually seeing

640
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,080
is the

641
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,880
first steam engine from 18th century

642
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,640
because they had lots of flooding so

643
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
they um

644
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
especially in mines so

645
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,960
thomas newcomen uh actually built this

646
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,159
steam engine to pump the water out and

647
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,559
that's how it all started

648
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,520
so here uh

649
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
the first industrial revolution is just

650
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,760
the use of machinery to help humans

651
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,440
uh when we were talking about the second

652
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,320
industrial revolution so that's your uh

653
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,520
that's your technological revolution so

654
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,039
here uh

655
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,159
we introduce new ways how to work and

656
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,200
live

657
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,159
because all of a sudden we have

658
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
electricity and light and we can work

659
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,840
longer but we can also um

660
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
we build a rail the road so we can

661
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
connect to each other we can

662
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,880
we can sell things and and move goods

663
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,840
and telegraph so we were able to call

664
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,559
each other and talk to each other um and

665
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,080
when we were talking about electric

666
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
electrification

667
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,960
um

668
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,279
your factory so the factories would have

669
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,480
electricity which meant a light

670
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,279
working longer and production lines uh

671
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,960
creation so

672
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
then um the

673
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
latest and greatest what we are living

674
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,320
right now is the third industrial

675
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,399
revolution and that's your digital

676
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,200
revolution so what it really is that is

677
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,080
the shift from the mechanical to the

678
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,880
analog uh electronic technology to the

679
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,039
digital electronics we use today so

680
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,559
that's your

681
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,399
that's your computerization of

682
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,559
everything the digitalization

683
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,720
um that is where we are living right now

684
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,039
but we are hearing a lot about industry

685
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,799
4.0

686
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,720
indeed it was originated in germany in

687
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,960
2011 so a little while ago uh because it

688
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
was it is it was it is an approach from

689
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,399
a german government that is promoting

690
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,440
the computerization but

691
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,960
where we were um

692
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,240
before being helped by the computers now

693
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,559
it's sort of moving like us helping the

694
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,200
computers the computers taking a lot of

695
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,279
uh load from us and uh being more

696
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,600
um maybe self-sustaining so this which

697
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
is why we're talking about

698
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,240
ai and machine learning um

699
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,480
cyber physical system so everything the

700
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
systems that where

701
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,679
the change in the physics cyber side of

702
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,559
things will uh produce a physical change

703
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,919
in the in the physical environment um

704
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,559
and that's where the smart factory came

705
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,440
from um

706
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,320
so that is where we are sort of heading

707
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,240
and that's why i was saying what's the

708
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,360
reality the reality is that the first

709
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,240
the purely smart factory was built only

710
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,559
two years ago in us so most of the

711
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,159
environments that you will be seeing

712
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,320
when we are talking about um

713
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,880
ot or ics

714
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,399
is not as connected um and the the truth

715
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,399
is actually we are just adding these

716
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,559
connected devices so it's creating this

717
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,000
like a

718
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,760
hybrid um

719
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,080
hybrid environments which have their

720
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,520
obviously their own um

721
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
their own issues so

722
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,039
remember this this is still where we are

723
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,880
so

724
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,159
how to be smarter and here i mean not to

725
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,039
be more connected necessarily it's more

726
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,039
about understanding what is it that we

727
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,320
have we understanding that um

728
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,520
we are just not we don't want to tell

729
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,640
our companies or our clients do just at

730
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
these devices we need to understand what

731
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,720
is happening that

732
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
perhaps uh

733
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,720
these environments will vary a lot so

734
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
you might get into an agreement that has

735
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
lots of uh legacy devices but you might

736
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
also get into something maybe it's a

737
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,320
completely really new

738
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,799
smart connected factory so

739
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,039
it's about understanding and for example

740
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,039
these days a research show that 75 of

741
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,279
the cso are worried about nation state

742
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,799
attacks

743
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,320
i mean it could be

744
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,240
uh that your uh client is a a nuclear

745
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,159
power plant and it's a critical national

746
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,880
infrastructure but in most cases it's

747
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,200
really

748
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
making

749
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
making them understand that they need to

750
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
get the basic rates

751
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,679
and that's the sort of the reality where

752
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,279
we are in these networks because

753
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,320
we need to go from the basics because in

754
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,880
most of the cases they start adding

755
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960
these connected devices while they

756
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,279
didn't set the basics right

757
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,120
so what are the basics uh you start

758
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,159
about

759
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,600
i think knowing

760
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,399
uh how to be smarter it's about knowing

761
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,000
yourself first

762
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,679
so you need to understand what is it

763
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,120
that's our in the network um

764
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,880
what kind of network are we talking

765
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
about uh

766
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
a network that

767
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,720
is somewhat heterogeneous or are we

768
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,360
actually thinking about um a network

769
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,679
that's still maybe working on a serial

770
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,000
connections and we want to add some

771
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,640
connectivity uh so we need to understand

772
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,159
what is it that we have what are the

773
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,399
parameter devices what is it inside the

774
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,559
network um

775
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,880
some of the most common issues that we

776
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,240
are actually seeing it's like a

777
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,640
weaknesses in the network segmentation

778
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,799
remember i told you

779
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,760
i think the the uh um

780
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,440
the part where

781
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,600
i really like the tableau approach it's

782
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,840
sort of it's segmenting the network and

783
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,760
segmentation is one of

784
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,519
one of the approaches that we tell our

785
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,880
customers to do

786
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,600
uh because

787
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,320
okay it it goes back to for example one

788
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,880
of the approaches is air gapping right

789
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,960
air gapping is this isolation from

790
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,799
internet and the idea is right

791
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,240
but

792
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,799
on average there are 11 direct

793
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,120
connections on an aircapped network

794
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
so you need to

795
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,039
you need to um

796
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,039
approach it with the the breach

797
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,399
principle so

798
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
understanding that you are most probably

799
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,000
breach and just looking for the

800
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,799
indicators of a compromise and one of

801
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,760
the ways how would we recommend is the

802
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,840
network segmentation because it's a

803
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,000
great from a point of view of security

804
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,360
so if if one network uh segment gets

805
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,519
breached not necessarily the other

806
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,840
segments get gets breached but it's also

807
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,600
uh great when we are talking about

808
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,440
patching which is another issue in this

809
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,640
um

810
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,320
in this network

811
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,360
use of insecure protocols um again you

812
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,799
need to understand what kind of

813
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,120
protocols you have um

814
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
we

815
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,200
are

816
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,399
seeing

817
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,799
very similar weaknesses in terms of the

818
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,600
the industrial protocol so it's a lot of

819
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,960
times um

820
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,720
it's uh

821
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,440
vulnerable to denial of service so you

822
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,000
need to segment it or you need to uh set

823
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,960
up the devices so they they can't dose

824
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,000
the rest of the network um we are seeing

825
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
a lot of it is uh lacking encryption so

826
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,440
again uh you need to be careful but

827
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,399
there there are more secure protocols

828
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,159
like opc ua i mentioned it here or uh

829
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,240
bacnet that are

830
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,600
these days the new iterations um for

831
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,559
example bacnet sc was only released last

832
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,600
year

833
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,039
they are

834
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,840
filled with security by design but they

835
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,000
need to be implemented securely so

836
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,720
that's again another um issue

837
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,200
um i mentioned the the batching is

838
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,880
another

839
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,200
issue we are seeing about

840
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,280
70 percent uh

841
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,079
uh

842
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:10,879
of

843
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,560
uh the os used in these environments is

844
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,239
actually unsupported

845
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,960
uh and you need to count with that again

846
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
you can segment the network securely but

847
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,599
you need to understand yourself and the

848
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,760
network that that you have there uh

849
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,599
credential management would be another

850
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,320
um issue that we are seeing a lot uh

851
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,918
especially the isolation of credential

852
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,119
management between it and ot side

853
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,119
because you need to separate that and um

854
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,679
yep it's not

855
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,119
it goes

856
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,560
back to awareness they need to the the

857
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,879
guys uh in these

858
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,520
uh power stations uh

859
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,000
that uh they need to understand why is

860
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,520
it that they need to use different

861
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,040
passwords for

862
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
for their industrial computer that's

863
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,960
connected to the industrial network and

864
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,119
their normal computer they use to

865
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,720
receive emails so okay you first

866
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,800
understand your internal third landscape

867
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,280
or your customer

868
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,040
the next one

869
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,440
i'm very passionate about is

870
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,160
the human thread landscape i think we

871
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,960
are um sort of forgetting about

872
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,280
this part a lot even on the i.t side of

873
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,359
things but

874
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,040
insider incidents were actually sixty

875
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,760
percent uh malicious insiders and about

876
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,400
forty percent uh negligence

877
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,119
so

878
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,200
that tells you a lot that that might be

879
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,359
actually something that uh that you want

880
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,359
to look into as i mentioned i believe

881
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,359
the security awareness in these

882
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
environments it's not

883
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,079
uh always done right uh because you need

884
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,640
to make difference between someone who

885
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,160
sits uh in a normal i.t business network

886
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,880
and someone who sits in an outstation

887
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
and dealing with all the

888
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,800
ot stuff

889
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,839
um

890
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,760
insider threat

891
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,480
has been raising recently because again

892
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,400
it's um

893
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,800
it's perhaps um

894
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
easier to coerce someone and to do

895
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
something like this

896
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,119
but i think you can just um

897
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,280
fight this by being a little bit more

898
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
kind

899
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,520
um i believe that we are still seeing a

900
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,079
lack of technological support for uh for

901
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,680
the humans in our network and that's

902
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
part of it like you can you should look

903
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,160
at your human thread landscape but you

904
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,440
should not forget about the

905
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
technological support of those humans

906
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,320
there

907
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
uh and processes and procedures um for

908
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,240
example use of usbs or personal devices

909
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,440
i understand that someone might be um

910
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,560
angry and that they can't bring their

911
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,880
normal uh future phone so like your

912
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,599
smartphone connected phone

913
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,000
um but you need to make them again that

914
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,599
goes back to the security awareness they

915
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,359
need to understand why they can't bring

916
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,079
it

917
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,320
because that's bringing in a usb that's

918
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,160
how stacks not happened

919
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,599
um

920
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,240
okay so you we understood our internal

921
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,960
landscape our human thread landscape so

922
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
then

923
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,680
it's the external third landscape so

924
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,880
where is the attack surface again

925
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,839
it goes back to the fact how does your

926
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,400
uh environment look like does it look

927
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
like there is an older environment that

928
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,680
really suits the the purdue model or are

929
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,400
we going moving towards more like the

930
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,880
tableau or the one in between where we

931
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,200
have uh where we are connecting to

932
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,680
cloud-based analytics for example and we

933
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,040
are still um

934
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,000
to even like the lower levels of the

935
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,320
processes so we need to

936
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,640
look at that

937
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,560
and understand that where is it that

938
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
that the threats could uh could come

939
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,520
from for example um shogun if you go to

940
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,800
showdown you will see lots lots of

941
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,160
ics exposed devices for example the hmis

942
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,720
around the human machine interface

943
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,960
you can find a lots of them there and

944
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,000
unfortunately it is possible and i

945
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
please don't do that you can just click

946
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,839
on them and there is star start stop

947
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,839
but you don't know what it's going to do

948
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,359
so this is important i believe there are

949
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,480
tools that

950
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,599
you can

951
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,240
um where you can be guarding your

952
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,720
infrastructure and if it doesn't come up

953
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,880
and it's not exposed on on

954
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,079
internet

955
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,200
internet or accessible over um

956
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,680
internet so you need to look at your

957
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,400
access control weaknesses you need to

958
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,920
look at the

959
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,040
the

960
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,119
the hardening of your network same as

961
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,680
the devices uh because then it might

962
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,520
just open some ports that it shouldn't

963
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,320
um

964
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,760
and

965
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,839
since we're at this industrial network

966
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,599
you also need to look at

967
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,960
your devices such as plcs or hmis if

968
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,760
there are they are not somewhat exposed

969
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,480
so

970
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,560
we understood internal

971
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,480
human threat landscape external search

972
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,800
landscape and

973
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,960
now

974
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,520
we need to know how to prioritize things

975
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,160
so we need to understand

976
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,119
what is important what parts and

977
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,000
functions of the networks we need to

978
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,280
maintain

979
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,240
uh

980
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,119
for

981
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,720
uh for it to to work depending again is

982
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,760
it a food plan so maybe it's a rather

983
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,200
business issue

984
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,800
or if it's uh

985
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
is it a nuclear plant where it would

986
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
become a safety issues with with if

987
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
something happens so

988
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,440
what are

989
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,359
what are your crown tools and so what

990
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,240
where do you put more um

991
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,880
more attention to what you really need

992
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
to maintain at all costs

993
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,400
uh then

994
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,079
i would say

995
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,920
on the rise we've seen lots of supply

996
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,119
chain attacks so that is something um

997
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,839
it goes from who you work with um

998
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,560
towards uh for example

999
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,040
there has been a

1000
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
latest research for example in libraries

1001
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,280
in opc ua that that then

1002
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,040
in the end there was a remote code

1003
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,400
execution so

1004
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,560
again uh supply chain attacks are

1005
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,400
another part of the issues that we

1006
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,800
should uh look at um

1007
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,720
when we are talking about the

1008
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,359
the the libraries as bom your salvage

1009
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,240
bill of materials you should um be aware

1010
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,480
of and use in these networks

1011
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,960
and then obviously

1012
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,359
once you build over that you know about

1013
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,480
all your

1014
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,240
thread landscapes

1015
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,839
you need someone to test it

1016
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:52,640
and

1017
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,599
be aware using things like there is a

1018
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,240
mitral attack for ics it's great way how

1019
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,240
to use it as a training tool or as a gap

1020
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,040
analysis tool and then you obviously

1021
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,800
test your network

1022
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,720
and

1023
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,640
i would like the thing that we are

1024
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,560
getting there after some certain

1025
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,160
maturity

1026
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,920
you can use things

1027
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,319
like honeypots and it's it's a great

1028
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,480
tool but again i said uh

1029
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,520
it needs some maturity you can't uh you

1030
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,160
can't use it just like this but then

1031
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,319
understanding um

1032
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,760
what is your

1033
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,599
thread landscape like if you are

1034
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,920
mirroring the system that you have you

1035
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,440
get an intelligence uh about

1036
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,800
is it someone who's just getting

1037
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,359
internet or is it coming from certain

1038
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,079
geolocation so

1039
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,160
that is probably uh your

1040
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,560
sort of in this ecosystem of how to

1041
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,800
protect these uh these environments that

1042
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560
that would be your last step and then

1043
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,680
it's rinse and repeat pretty much

1044
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,800
so

1045
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,480
that was it

1046
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,760
i am not sure there is q a but thank you

1047
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,359
so much for taking time um and i'm here

1048
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,520

1049
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
