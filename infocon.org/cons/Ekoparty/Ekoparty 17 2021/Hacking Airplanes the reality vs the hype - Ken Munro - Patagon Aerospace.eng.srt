1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,199
okay man how are you ken

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,759
hey i'm doing good i'm here

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
you made it

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,320
yeah my isp fell over a few minutes

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
before the talk was due to start bad day

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,519
okay no problem no problem

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,560
so your talk is amazing i think that i

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,920
don't i'm not going to to present you or

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,439
something like that

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
i let you present yourself on the talk

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,640
and everything uh i really want to thank

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
you very much for being here in

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,120
particular space in akubari this is like

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,680
our second year uh

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
we took a lot of effort to prepare all

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,160
these stocks here so

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,399
thank you so much for being here

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,120
um sorry for this swap of the talks

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,360
we save you

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
and it was amazing

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,640
uh well ken uh this is your stage

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,360
have fun and okay

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,239
we are

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,359
all eyes and ears okay good so i've got

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,359
a talk today uh that's based on about

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,760
the last three years of research where

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
we've had the privilege of having access

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
to a number of airplanes and being able

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
to spend time doing security research so

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,840
let me share

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
my slide deck and let's get started

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,439
shall we uh it's one of the most fun

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,520
things i've done for a very long time

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,759
but what i want to do is really look at

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,479
what's the reality what's the hype what

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
do we know so hopefully you can see my

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,840
slide deck there who are we well first

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,000
of all i'm a pilot uh i'm not a very

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
good pilot though but i have colleagues

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
who are also pilots some private pilots

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,880
some commercial pilots so we have a

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,680
current boeing 747 pilot on our team and

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
that's been really helpful because it

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
helps us understand how commercial

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
aviation works whereas my knowledge is

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,200
mostly private aviation

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,640
we have a lot of people on the team we

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
spend a lot of time working on planes

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,920
that's us on the right in 747 we'll talk

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,479
about that in a minute

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280
one really important point from me

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
is that we have to be super responsible

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,840
even more responsible than any other

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
industry perhaps outside healthcare

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,840
because disclosure in aviation is

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,759
complicated and difficult and one of the

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,919
challenges about that is the media

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
doesn't really understand the separate

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
domains on board an aircraft it's going

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
to take a long time to get

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
vulnerabilities fixed because aircraft

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
is certified you can't just apply a

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
patch it has to go through testing it

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,879
has to be approved it has to be rolled

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,879
out through a complex ecosystem you

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,879
can't hack the plane from the infra

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,239
entertainment system it doesn't work

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,720
like that uh domains so the primary

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
domain the one that's most interesting

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,160
to us is the aircraft control domain

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
that's bit that has all the controls the

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,680
uppy downey lefty righty engines and

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
things

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,200
you have the aisd which is for cabin

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,080
crew particularly which contains

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
communication protocols for passenger

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
systems and then you have the bit that

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
we've all experienced so the passenger

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
and information entertainment so

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,319
in-flight inflate entertainment and

81
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,760
services domain that's where there's

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
some fun stuff to be found as well but

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
these domains are separate the acd does

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,280
not touch the aisd

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
there's also a lot of connections out

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,120
there so this is where things get quite

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,920
interesting a lot of data goes to and

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
from airplanes now and that started to

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,280
expand the attack surface somewhat so in

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
the past where you had to physically be

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
in an airplane

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,319
they're an increasing number of vectors

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,560
to remotely compromise an airplane but

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,959
there are many many layers of security

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,959
and defense in the way

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,319
be very careful what anyone says about

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,920
vulnerabilities in airplanes in the

98
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
media

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,280
the media gets very excited and there

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
have been a lot of stories that did a

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,799
lot of damage not all of which were

102
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
based upon fact

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,599
but what's changed well

104
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,879
all of a sudden

105
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,959
maybe a little bit of silver lining from

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,200
the coronavirus pandemic is that a lot

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,760
of older aeroplanes have been retired

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
and the breakers yards

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,080
the boneyards are backed up they have

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
too much work on

111
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,519
so we had a really interesting

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,480
opportunity to work with a breakers yard

113
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,959
where they would bring a plane in and it

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,120
would be sat there for months and months

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
before they could get to parting it out

116
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
and breaking it up and we arranged to

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
have access to these aeroplanes we could

118
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,000
power them up we could light the engines

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
we could put ground power on and we

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
could do pen testing on real aeroplanes

121
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,680
without any fear of causing problems for

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,199
those aeroplanes in the future because

123
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,000
they were going to be scrapped

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
now

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
there are some big caveats uh get bench

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
power for avionics is dangerous these

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,479
things work at 400 volts very high amps

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,080
you run the risk of powering these

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
things and blowing yourself up you can

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,919
throw yourself across the room some

131
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
older components use crts with large

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,040
power capacitors inside them make sure

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
you've discharged everything before you

134
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
touch anything and take good electrical

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,479
safety precautions

136
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,800
you will find unusual protocols so the

137
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
most common protocol you'll find will be

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
um

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,720
aaron 329

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,360
sorry 429 which is a very old protocol

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
it's quite easy to work with you can

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,360
decode it using a picoscope but decoding

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
is one thing injecting is another thing

144
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,400
altogether it's not easy uh in the

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,680
boeing triple seven you'll find uh our

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
inc 629 which is a different protocol

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,320
very hard and expensive to decode but as

148
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,039
we go towards the 787 uh the boeing um

149
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,759
uh and sorry various uh later air buses

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,720
you'll find in the abs a350 you'll find

151
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
aaron 664 which is an ethernet based

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
protocol interesting

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
what we're starting to find is

154
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,479
components are becoming available but

155
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
they're all very old so if you jump on

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
ebay you'll find some components being

157
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
parted out but they're all 10 15 20

158
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
years old anything that's still

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
certified and flyable is expensive but

160
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
there's fun stuff to be done so you can

161
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,199
jump in the cockpit of an old plane

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
power it up and start decoding traffic

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
and that's us working on airbus a320 a

164
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
little while ago

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
now what goes wrong well

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
sometimes it's surprising things so

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
there's uh an operator in the usa raven

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
there they were subject to ransomware

169
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
attack it looks like their maintenance

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,160
logs was encrypted and the backups

171
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
you cannot dispatch a plane into flight

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
if you cannot prove it as airworthy

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
which is why your maintenance logs are

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,639
really really important

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,160
no maintenance log because it's been

176
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,080
ransomed you don't fly

177
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
sadly that airline seems to have gone

178
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
bankrupt in the last year which is a

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
real shame other crazy things you'll

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
find

181
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
an electronic flight back they're

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
increasingly being used to save paper

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
it's fundamentally a tablet an ipad or

184
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
an android tablet electronic flight bag

185
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
used for lots of functions that i'll

186
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
talk about in a lot more detail in a few

187
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,759
minutes

188
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,639
but an efb

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,240
application crashed this is i think

190
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,520
2015. american airlines lost access to

191
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,039
the electronic flight bag apps with

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,039
which you could not depart you couldn't

193
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,560
get the charts up to tell you how to

194
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
take off and land and as a result the

195
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
efbs didn't work and thousands of

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
flights did not go that day it turned

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,479
out to be a corruption issue to do with

198
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,199
a duplicate chart for washington

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,520
national ronald reagan airport

200
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,199
another example this is much more recent

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,280
this was last year so southwest their

202
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
weather app on the electronic flight

203
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,599
bags failed not clear why but the

204
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,560
weather wasn't delivered and

205
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,919
1415 flights did not move they're all

206
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,039
delayed

207
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,960
you cannot just go on yahoo and get the

208
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,319
weather for a flight you have to have

209
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,720
very specific types of weather for an

210
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,680
aircraft to fly and land

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
other crazy things i'll go into this in

212
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
a lot more detail in a few minutes other

213
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
challenges around electronic flight bags

214
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
include the calculations you do for

215
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,599
takeoff and landing you might not be

216
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,080
aware that very few airplanes take off

217
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,479
with full power for reasons of carbon

218
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,720
dioxide saving engine wear and

219
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,440
efficiency you use a reduced power in

220
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
almost all takeoffs

221
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
there are consequences because those

222
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,280
calculations are done on the electronic

223
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,680
flight bag fortunately i believe there's

224
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,840
only been one fatal accident this is in

225
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,520
2004 from a 747 200

226
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
by mk airlines and through a

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,840
miscalculation in the electronic

228
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,639
calculations from the flight back the

229
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
uh pilots didn't put on enough power

230
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
they were tired they didn't recognize it

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
they went off the runway and sadly the

232
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,479
airplane crash caught fire more common

233
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
you see tail strikes happen where pilots

234
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,879
make miscalculations they over rotate

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,160
because they haven't got enough power

236
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
and they trash the back of the plane

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,720
that can be very dangerous too as well

238
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,559
other errors now when you start getting

239
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,839
access to planes you're going to find

240
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,760
lots of old stuff you'll be very

241
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,039
surprised how old some of the

242
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,279
technologies are in there but even so

243
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,360
you have to be careful this is a retired

244
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
747 that we were working on we had

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,440
access to the in-flight entertainment

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
system and flight attendants panel so

247
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,720
we're all over the um aisd

248
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
even so even though this plane was

249
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,040
retired some of the systems it talked to

250
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
were still live for other airplanes on

251
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
the fleet so be careful

252
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,880
don't spook the media into around

253
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
publishing very scary stories that upset

254
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
people but to give you an example of how

255
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
bad things can do it can be this is a

256
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
747 we were working on it last flew in

257
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,600
april 2020 we were working on it in june

258
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,959
2020 and on there we found the aisd

259
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,120
cabin management terminal so that's the

260
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
bit that the crew use for managing the

261
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
in-flight entertainment system and all

262
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
sorts of other things like meals and

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
messaging to the ground was running

264
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
windows nc service pack for

265
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
amazingly old it was quite fun actually

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
we'd uh i don't know about you i've

267
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,399
forgotten how to hack nt so we actually

268
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,000
had to go through a process of reminding

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
ourselves and come up with a viable

270
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,279
attack that's on our blog you can go and

271
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,720
read the full story of how we did this

272
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
successfully but yeah sometimes you find

273
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
very very old things

274
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,720
you'll also find floppy disks on planes

275
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,399
from time to time but she got with me

276
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,959
this is a navigational database from

277
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
boeing 747 that's in the cockpit you'll

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
find her updated over floppy disk which

279
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,080
is kind of cool you'll find pc cards in

280
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
the avionics bays the thing on the right

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
there that is a quick access recorder

282
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,959
uses a pc card uh fortunately this one

283
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,519
had an adapter to take it to cf so

284
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
compact flash and from that we could

285
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,680
download and extract the quick access

286
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
recorded data which was all the faults

287
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
on the plane and management logging

288
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
you'll also find some stuff you'll be

289
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
familiar with so you do find ethernet

290
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
but typically not on the uh control

291
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,600
domain you'll tend to find ethernet on

292
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,560
the

293
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,839
in-flight entertainment system and the

294
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,000
similar and you'll find crazy stuff so

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
that is the operating system disk it's a

296
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,920
solid state disk for

297
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
a reasonably recent uh cabin management

298
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
system i need to go back and get an

299
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,839
image of that disk before they take the

300
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,399
plane apart be fun to see what's there

301
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,240
where things get interesting is when we

302
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
start to see uh passion to wi-fi

303
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
some examples from the flight attendants

304
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
panel here the attendance panel is in

305
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,959
the galley in the in the accessible part

306
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,000
of the

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
cabin

308
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
obviously if you are messing around with

309
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,279
this i expect the crew to come and have

310
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,680
a very stern word with you and also bear

311
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
in mind that other passengers are likely

312
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
to take extreme exception to you

313
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
interfering with anything in the

314
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
airplane so don't do this without

315
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
permission please

316
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,839
what we discovered we could tamper with

317
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
the wi-fi we could get onto the backbone

318
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,839
network for the in-flight entertainment

319
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,079
system and we could knock things out

320
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,160
worst case so the ife stops working

321
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,519
people get annoyed because they can't

322
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,519
see movies but hey

323
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,959
basic learning we've reported these

324
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
vulnerabilities they've been fixed one

325
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,519
really fun one though are a 747 that was

326
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,800
23 years old its ife had been updated it

327
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
was only about three or four years old

328
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,279
we discovered when it lands it uploads

329
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,839
the latest movies uh from an amazon s3

330
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
bucket when the weight goes onto the

331
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,839
wheels of the undercarriage it enables a

332
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,279
wireless access point that connects to

333
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,760
ground systems and pulls the media for

334
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
the movies we discovered that the s3

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
bucket was read white and of course

336
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,000
managed to extract the credentials for

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
that from the in-flight entertainment

338
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,639
system

339
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,240
uh actually the vendor involved in this

340
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
was extremely cool they uh took our

341
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
report very quickly got the credentials

342
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
changed and changed the way that they

343
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
authentic authenticated to this system

344
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
it was great really really cool vendor

345
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
not like some vendors we've worked with

346
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
in aviation

347
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
also on the cabin management terminal we

348
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
discovered we could access a number of

349
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
plain text protocols and we could access

350
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,920
the input entertainment system and

351
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,399
potentially push new media so

352
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
what would you do does it really matter

353
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,839
maybe you could push some i don't know

354
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,160
pornography pretty unpleasant make for a

355
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
bad press story or perhaps more worrying

356
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,000
is put up a video showing the plane's

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,839
been hijacked that would really spook

358
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
the passengers would it spook passions

359
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,880
into doing something dangerous perhaps

360
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,720
so that's the biggest worry to me

361
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
typically the uplinks for the passenger

362
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
wifis uh

363
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,399
whilst they're vsat over the oceans over

364
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,839
the land they're typically a downward

365
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,959
facing lte or 4g downward link

366
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
we were looking at the router for it we

367
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
discovered credentials and guess what

368
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,760
they were written on the door of the

369
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
cupboard that the wi-fi router sat in so

370
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
that was pretty bad i'm sure they can do

371
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,639
better

372
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,320
in general what do we find well you find

373
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,800
a lot of old systems on planes you find

374
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,279
very old protocols and components you're

375
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
going to find very old hardware lots of

376
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
exposed physical interfaces but

377
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
physical security controls do work

378
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
if you're just messing around with

379
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,839
systems on a plane that's being used

380
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
you're going to get arrested

381
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,920
if it's not the cabin crew that um come

382
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,760
and um apprehend you it's going to be

383
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,600
another passenger i'd be very upset if

384
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,720
someone was

385
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
trying to hack a plane

386
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,399
the next step one of the projects we

387
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,720
want to look at is actually getting the

388
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,680
vsat terminal adapter out of the

389
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,839
overhead space in the 747 that's my

390
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
colleague dave who's up in the passenger

391
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,720
cabin in the roof and up there on a tray

392
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
is the terminal for the vsat no sign of

393
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,760
any ethernet it's all eric 429 but we're

394
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,519
going to get hold of that shortly and

395
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,120
see what we can do in terms of hardware

396
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,720
reverse engineering on the vsat that'll

397
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
be really interesting

398
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
now i've talked about electronic flight

399
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
bags these are an area of extreme

400
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
interest to me right now

401
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,320
what we discover is actually really

402
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,040
weak standards for uh

403
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
pilots using these devices many airlines

404
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
actively encourage the pilots to use

405
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
their efb tablets as a personal device

406
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
too i'm not sure about that we hear lots

407
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,880
of stories about doing personal email

408
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,279
watching netflix

409
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,519
browsing pornography and other really

410
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,240
unsavory things on a critical device

411
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,720
that's really important so

412
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
there are two types of efb broadly

413
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,079
there's a portable so that's one the

414
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,240
pilot takes home so an ipad or an

415
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,800
android tablet and an installed efb

416
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,399
which is physically bolted into the

417
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
airplane there are some halfway houses

418
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
so on the a350 there's a halfway that's

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,720
kind of sort of installed uh and there

420
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,199
are some others as well but

421
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,920
our primary interest is in portable efbs

422
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
because they leave the airplane

423
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,440
installed the fbs are protected behind

424
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,519
the cockpit door much much harder to get

425
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,480
access

426
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,959
so we spent time looking at performance

427
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,040
calculators and as i mentioned a moment

428
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,279
ago this is when you add power it tells

429
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
you how much power based on your weight

430
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,480
the runway length the wind your engines

431
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,240
all sorts of things temperatures and

432
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,560
that will then calculate how much power

433
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
you need to apply on your engines to

434
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
take off safely

435
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,800
there are multiple inputs and the

436
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,560
electronic flight back does this and

437
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,079
calculates it for you

438
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,160
typically on airbus with what's called a

439
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
flex temp calculation

440
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,759
on boeings and others it's called the

441
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,320
d-rate calculation and your d rate on a

442
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,519
737 might range from about 57 percent up

443
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,720
to about

444
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,519
90 something it's very rare you use 100

445
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,720
power

446
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,040
now a lot of that data comes from an api

447
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,320
a lot of those calculations are done

448
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,160
locally on the device we have found

449
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,680
vulnerabilities in electronic flight

450
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
back apps that would allow one to tamper

451
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
with the calculation data you'd need a

452
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,160
degree of privilege to the device

453
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,320
but you could compromise the way the

454
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,079
calculations are made and the way that

455
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,240
the data is handled a lot of the data is

456
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,759
stored locally for example runway

457
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
lengths if you could tamp with that you

458
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
can cause an incorrect um d-rate or flex

459
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
temp calculation to be performed what

460
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,600
the efb does is it outputs

461
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
power requirements and v-speeds now v1

462
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
is the speed at which the airplane can

463
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
safely stop while still on the runway

464
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
vr is the rotation speed so that's the

465
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
one where you pull back the columns and

466
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
the plane starts to rotate v2 is the

467
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
take-off safety speed at which you can

468
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
take off safely uh with only one engine

469
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,279
now the gap between v1 and v2 i can tell

470
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,360
you as a pilot is quite a scary place

471
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
because you can't stop but you can't

472
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,360
take off anyway

473
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
incorrect v-speeds could be produced so

474
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
the pilot rotates too early or too late

475
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,120
too early you create a tail strike too

476
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,279
late you run the risk of taking off too

477
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,600
low and potentially infringing safety

478
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,240
heights as you take off on landing if

479
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,920
you can tamper with landing performance

480
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,439
calculations you run the risk of the

481
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,919
pilot having the wrong braking settings

482
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,760
and sliding off the end of the runway or

483
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
doing too much braking and you end up

484
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,720
causing excess tyre wear or potentially

485
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,799
bursting a tyre

486
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,400
we have found worse vulnerabilities on

487
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
installed efbs but we accept that risks

488
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
are mitigated because they're in the

489
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
cockpit uh we've found trivially

490
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,720
exploitable vulnerabilities uh you could

491
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
uh break out of these uh in the cockpit

492
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,039
you could also they're also exposed

493
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,280
ports and the approach to security for

494
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,880
many is to put a sticker over it saying

495
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
don't use it which isn't good

496
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,679
there are lots more things that an efb

497
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,320
does they contain a lot of

498
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
passenger information and lots more i

499
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
won't go into that but there's lots more

500
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
to be done and there's lots more covered

501
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,440
on our blog

502
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
one of the main problems i have is it's

503
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,160
taking time for the aviation industry to

504
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
catch up and truly understand cyber

505
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,360
security

506
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
security has been baked into aircraft

507
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
design very early stage but

508
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,240
unfortunately not all the aviation

509
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
organizations are have the same

510
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
approaches to cyber security

511
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
we found four separate vulnerabilities

512
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,679
in electronic flight bags

513
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,240
uh three of them um

514
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
have had variable responses to

515
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,559
disclosure including one who said that

516
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,960
fixing the vulnerability would be a a

517
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,919
feature update however one vendor was

518
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,840
amazing took it very seriously fixed it

519
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
very quickly and we think they're

520
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
amazing very variable approach to

521
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
security and integrating and interfacing

522
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
with researchers

523
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,000
sometimes we also see approaches to efbs

524
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
getting things wrong

525
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,679
a common lock down for an ipad for

526
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,000
example on the ground a corporate device

527
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,520
is to use something like face id or

528
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,559
similar

529
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,440
yeah

530
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,039
if you get the lock down wrong you're

531
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,720
going to cause safety problems and a

532
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
great example of this is using or

533
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,799
mandating face id to unlock your ipad

534
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,799
because pilots like wearing mirrored

535
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,799
sunglasses they don't work very well for

536
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,160
face id

537
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,799
we also have problems uh in an emergency

538
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,720
situation your pilot may have been

539
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,039
depressurizing the pilot needs to put on

540
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,039
an oxygen mask in order not to pass out

541
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,840
so they can do an emergency

542
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,520
descent and face id doesn't work very

543
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
well very well when you've got an oxygen

544
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,679
mask on that's really important because

545
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,840
on that electronic flight bag is your

546
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
emergency

547
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,760
or electronic quick reference handbook

548
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
and that tells you how to deal with an

549
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,799
instant typically a depressurization and

550
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,320
crash descent

551
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
is done from memory but you have to then

552
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,559
cross check using your eqrh

553
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,840
but you can't unlock it because you've

554
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,400
got a face mask on great so there's a

555
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
lot of thought required and we put a lot

556
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
of good advice for airlines and

557
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
operators thinking about how to lock

558
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,919
down their efb safely

559
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,360
there's also big challenges around

560
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,000
regulation so we've advised various

561
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
regulators about how they could improve

562
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,840
cyber security but there are differences

563
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,080
between the european regulator the faa

564
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,320
and the us and the uk regulated the caa

565
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,679
there are differences in the way that

566
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,440
regulation is done some are very

567
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,080
prescriptive some are not

568
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
other stuff we do we've done a lot of

569
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,200
work on a cars which is the text-based

570
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,880
over rf

571
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,440
protocol that sends data to planes tcas

572
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,880
that's the collision avoidance system

573
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
that stops planes crashing into each

574
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,159
other in the sky and lots of other stuff

575
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,120
too

576
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,480
some interesting research done by

577
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,840
another organization looked at the

578
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,080
potential of spoofing the instrument

579
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,559
landing system now we have an airbus

580
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,919
a320 simulator here which we do a lot of

581
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,159
replays and recreations of instance to

582
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,000
see how they work and a good example

583
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,520
this is taking the work that was done by

584
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,679
others and showing the real impacts of

585
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,840
this you can see here the instrument

586
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,679
landing system crosshairs are aligned on

587
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,520
the left-hand display on the primary

588
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,760
flight display or pfd

589
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
we look at the window we're in cloud

590
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
obviously it's an instrument landing so

591
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
we can't see anything but we're aligned

592
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,000
on the

593
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,919
on the approach however when we pop out

594
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,679
of the cloud you see the crosshairs are

595
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,640
still centered but actually we're about

596
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
400 meters to the west of san

597
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,520
francisco's runway 27 left so actually

598
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,840
if we carry on to do a category 3

599
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,919
approach which is where the plane auto

600
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,000
lands you run the risk of ditching in

601
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
the ocean now

602
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
practically this is difficult there's a

603
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
lot of rf power required and it's more

604
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
likely that what the pilot will see will

605
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,000
be the navigation flags flipping and out

606
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
as they get raked signals the pilot will

607
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
then use other sources of information to

608
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
land

609
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
tcat spoofing is quite interesting this

610
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
is how you stop planes crashing into

611
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
each other their transponders will

612
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
interrogate each other and if they

613
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
detect a collision potential they'll

614
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
give each other avoiding actions a

615
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,880
resolution advisory or ra one plane will

616
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,280
climb the other plane will descend

617
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,120
however some really cool research that

618
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
was backed up by avsec oxford another

619
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
aviation research group showed that you

620
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,600
could cause planes particularly certain

621
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,760
air buses which will fly the resolution

622
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,000
advisory under autopilot to actually

623
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
create

624
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,559
uncommanded climbs in the sense

625
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
including um up and down which is really

626
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
interesting again technically

627
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,880
challenging to reproduce because you've

628
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
got to do it at altitude which probably

629
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,159
means you've got to be on board one of

630
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,559
the planes with some large rf gear but

631
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,400
still interesting that there is

632
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,120
potential to produce um bogus alerts

633
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,520
my advice for everybody is be careful

634
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,240
don't go hacking planes without explicit

635
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,600
permission

636
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
there have been all sorts of cases where

637
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,039
researchers have been playing with the

638
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,799
in-flight entertainment system and going

639
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,919
too far

640
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
that is illegal don't do it get

641
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
permission there are breakers yards

642
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,919
around if you're

643
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,520
lucky you find the right people at the

644
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,200
right time maybe have to pay a little

645
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,600
bit money we usually have to pay for the

646
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,679
jet fuel to power the airplane it's not

647
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,440
cheap costs us four to five hundred

648
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
dollars an hour

649
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,320
or we can get ground power a bit cheaper

650
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
but it costs money to do to power the

651
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,720
systems up

652
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,880
don't fall for media hype the aircraft

653
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
control domain is separate from the rest

654
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,480
of the in-flight entertainment systems

655
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,640
you can't hack the plane from the cabin

656
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,760
certainly not in the way that's been

657
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,559
described by some

658
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,480
there's also certification out there so

659
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,159
you can't expect an aviation

660
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,400
manufacturer simply to patch a plane it

661
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,320
takes a lot of time to approve this

662
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,080
buy your own kit you can get it on ebay

663
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,559
it's old and bear in mind that technical

664
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,480
debt is a major problem too but there's

665
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
lots to do and it's really exciting

666
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
place and i would strongly recommend

667
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,679
anyone get involved in the aviation

668
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,200
village the aerospace village at defcon

669
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,799
is really cool we'll be there this year

670
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,559
with our simulators demonstrating lots

671
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,159
of cool stuff you can do and lots of

672
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
hardware we'll take as well lots more

673
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
reading on our blog that's a small

674
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,280
section of it and there's my details if

675
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
you want to follow or ask more questions

676
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
offline please

677
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,159
anyway i hope you enjoyed it thanks for

678
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,480
listening

679
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
ken absolutely amazing the talk was

680
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
incredible a lot of information a lot of

681
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,000
stuff

682
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,840
and the last important thing

683
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
and maybe the most important thing is

684
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,720
not to

685
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,200
to do illegal things without permission

686
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,200
but we are entering now to the q a

687
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
section um

688
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,440
maybe there will be some questions maybe

689
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,559
not

690
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,840
um

691
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
i want to ask you first of all before

692
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
the questions that are going to pop up

693
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,120
in the chat um

694
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
how was this this process of of checking

695
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,880
the security of an airplane of studying

696
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
the security of an airplane uh in it was

697
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,640
like something like research you did it

698
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
like uh shots for job

699
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
how you started with this

700
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,440
yeah so we got started uh about three

701
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,279
and a half years ago

702
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,000
uh one of my colleagues uh we were

703
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,919
driving past a boneyard

704
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
for airplanes and uh we rang them and

705
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
said hey can we come play and we're like

706
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,960
okay

707
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
um

708
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,840
a real surprise

709
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
uh they had some planes that they hadn't

710
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
taken apart yet

711
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
they put power to them and let us play

712
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
and we were blown away it's great um we

713
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
bought some components from them uh

714
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,000
we've got all sorts of fun things in

715
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,440
fact you can probably see behind me this

716
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,880
is part of a320 over here i've got some

717
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
some more components too

718
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
so yeah it's it's a great relationship

719
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,360
we've done it at our own cost uh to

720
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,039
really try and drive the industry

721
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,600
forward uh we do do now paid work in

722
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
aviation so we've been asked to test all

723
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,640
sorts of things by arab operators uh and

724
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
airports but yeah we were doing this for

725
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,559
our own interest and our own fun

726
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,679
amazing

727
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,000
um something that is this interesting

728
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
about this is like um the technology

729
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
evolves and we have a lot of information

730
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
and software and computers

731
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,320
in the

732
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,120
aerospace industry so we have

733
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,240
so much uh to learn about it and we have

734
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,840
so much to learn

735
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,400
in in our space security so

736
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,440
for us that we are you know like we have

737
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
our differences uh

738
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,360
to united states or

739
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,720
or you know

740
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,120
or england so

741
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,039
how do you feel like

742
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,559
this um

743
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,960
aerospace security industry

744
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,720
uh is is evolving and and how

745
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,039
and what will be um

746
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,320
a cool

747
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
thing to to the people that is watching

748
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,840
this talk

749
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,960
to learn

750
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,159
like he like in career path in in case

751
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,640
they really want to start doing some

752
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,000
security

753
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,799
uh

754
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,200
audits or something testing or some kind

755
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,039
of of security staff inner space so so

756
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,960
what would be your advice

757
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
for the people that's watching us

758
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,240
and

759
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,159
yeah industry has come along a long way

760
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,000
in two years um you might remember

761
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,720
boeing had a run-in with io active two

762
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
years ago now maybe a bit more

763
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,640
that no one ended up looking good at the

764
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,159
end of but actually bearing have come a

765
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,840
long way they've engaged with the

766
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
aerospace village they've come to come

767
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
to

768
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
to help support the village as well

769
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720
which is really cool

770
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
two years ago rsa they brought an

771
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,760
electronic flight back with them and

772
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
demonstrated it it was super cool and

773
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,919
they've also invited us and other

774
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,240
village members to

775
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,760
their factories we've seen a lot of

776
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,200
their cyber security offerings which is

777
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
cool

778
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,640
the industry used to be really close to

779
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,039
external research but that's changing uh

780
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,799
boeing has led the way there they've

781
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,600
been amazingly cool and done a great job

782
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
of opening up to engage with researchers

783
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
i think industry more broadly has a long

784
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,240
way to go we've been very surprised at

785
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,960
the

786
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,600
very dated response to cyber security

787
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,640
and research uh by some but many others

788
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,960
are improving ways to get involved is

789
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
you need to understand the protocols

790
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
involved so you need to learn eric 49

791
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,360
eric 9 and 664

792
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
there's a lot of learning to be done

793
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,520
there

794
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,679
you don't just pen test a plane

795
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,200
one of the challenges being is you can't

796
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
predict how some of the unusual

797
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,039
protocols and systems will respond

798
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,880
so i'd strongly recommend that anything

799
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,600
you do is passive do not do anything

800
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,760
active on a plane ever you don't know

801
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
how the system is going to respond so be

802
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,000
careful

803
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,200
okay again so we are finished our time

804
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,840
now i really want to thank you so much

805
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,279
for being here

806
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,159
for this crazy switch of the talks and

807
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,480
i'm trying to make the best of

808
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,679
of this

809
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,840

cooperation i hope

813
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,200
uh in case we have some q a
