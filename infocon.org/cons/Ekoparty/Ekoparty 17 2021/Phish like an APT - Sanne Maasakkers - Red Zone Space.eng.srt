1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,920
hey

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,080
uh welcome to my presentation and it's

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
called fish like an apt

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,480
uh with the other name phenomenal

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
pretexting for persuasive phishing

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,080
and this is a presentation about why you

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,640
should think about what

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800
you're going to use as a scenario during

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,359
your next apt emulation

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,040
so uh about me um i'll try to do this in

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,680
spanish please correct me if wrong

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,320
but i uh thank you duolingo uh for doing

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
this me nombre is sana massacres a uh

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,120
yo

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,719
people research and intel fusion um and

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,719
oh and i'll continue in english now

17
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,239
because it's way

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,479
easier for me but i work in the right

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
team and i research an intro fusion team

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
so that means that i combine the

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
offensive

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,439
uh way of thinking together with uh

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
threat intelligence so i combine them um

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,560
and do the threat intel part and red

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,680
team part

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
um and this is what i always like to say

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,799
is that i once successfully fished the

28
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,360
white team or alequipo blanco i guess

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,040
it was

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
a fishing assignment once in a reti in a

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,479
red team and they asked me to send a

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,840
fishing mail

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,759
which was an uh sharepoint scenario and

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,079
the white team did know that there was

35
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
going to be a phishing assessment um but

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,759
they still clicked on my link because i

37
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,640
made it super realistic so that's really

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,479
nice to tell everyone

39
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,759
that i'm able to make phishing emails

40
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
that are really realistic i guess

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,719
and uh last thing that i would like to

42
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
mention is that i was the apt during the

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
biggest dutch cyber crisis exercise this

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
year uh we

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,879
had a big big dutch cyber crisis

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,879
exercise with vital infrastructure in

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,239
the netherlands and i was asked to be uh

48
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
affected well non-existent apt or not uh

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
not real existent apt uh and i had to

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
send out fishing mills but also create

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,879
the entire attack so if someone needs a

52
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,599
fishing scenario for the non-existent

53
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,280
apt called rasperia please let me know

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,239
i'll tell you everything about it

55
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,760
so um

56
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
this presentation is about fishing

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,160
during adversary emulation

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
and what do we know about fishing and

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
adversary immolation well we know that

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
fishing is a commonly used technique to

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,720
get initial access

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,519
research shows that around 90

63
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
of all attacks start with a phishing

64
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,640
email um and there are a couple of uh

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
yeah wait ways to uh to obtain uh

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
uh initial access um and um our friends

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,680
of uh the monitor um defined three ways

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,760
uh within the technique t1566

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
um called fishing and those three are

70
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
the spear fishing attachment the spear

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
fishing link and spear fishing via

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,239
service um the spear fishing attachment

73
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
is just like what's here on the screen

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,599
uh you send an email you add an

75
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,319
attachment like a malicious doc for

76
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,959
example weaponized document

77
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
and you send it to the victim victim

78
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
opens the attachment and got affected

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
the second one is the spear phishing

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
link that's sending an email to the

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,159
victim with the link in it it could be

82
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,799
to a credential harvesting page a login

83
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,840
page or maybe a link

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,120
that downloads a file um and the last

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,840
one is spearfishing via surface and that

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,319
one is really interesting i think um

87
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,120
that is not using uh email itself as um

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,760
as the way to deliver your mower for

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
example but um

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,279
using a surface uh it could be an online

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,160
service like dropbox or onenote for

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
example uh but also a telegram or a

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
linkedin page

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
or a

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
conversation

96
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
and why do we send these emails still um

97
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
during uh well adversary emulations but

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800
also why

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,360
cyber criminals send it is because it

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
just works every time

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,520
um well

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
it's still shown because it's still sent

103
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
by cyber criminals and we still use it

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,639
during

105
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,800
adversary emulations and red teams

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
because we know that if we send an email

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
someone clicks

108
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,759
and that has different reason reasons

109
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,120
because

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
why someone clicks

111
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,120
so why do we actually click and i think

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,440
this is relevant information to know why

113
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
it's still effective

114
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,400
and what we can do to have it as

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,120
effective as it is now so why do we

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
click um there are three reasons the

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,080
first one is the recipient did not get

118
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,400
security awareness training

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,120
so if someone didn't get security

120
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
awareness training that person doesn't

121
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
know if it's a legitimate mail or a

122
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,479
phishing email so the person clicks on

123
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,880
it because it thinks it it's a

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,919
legitimate meal um what i also see in

125
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,520
this one is that um security training is

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
not really good so it's almost nothing

127
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,199
or is not

128
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,039
repeated every year um so still no

129
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,360
security awareness

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,840
the second one is that the email is more

131
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
advanced than the awareness training

132
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
coverage so if you got an email which is

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,440
really realistic and you got in your

134
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
awareness training that you have to

135
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
check if

136
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
the sender address is uh contains a typo

137
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,720
for example and the email is sent from a

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
spoofed email address then the email is

139
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
more advanced than your trade awareness

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,400
training coverage so i think this is

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,440
the case in a lot of a lot of yeah

142
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,120
emulations because what i see is

143
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
that security awareness training is

144
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,039
often

145
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,479
really outdated

146
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,840
i still find some organizations that

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
tell people that you have to check if

148
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,440
there's a lock next to your url so if it

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,520
is https

150
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,759
or not so and if there is not a lock

151
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,199
then it's probably

152
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
a fishing website and if there's luck

153
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,919
it's probably a legit website well i

154
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,800
don't know but that's really really bad

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
awareness training because we see that

156
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,520
every fishing site

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,280
has that lock it has https thanks let's

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
encrypt and all that kind of services to

159
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,840
make it really easy so

160
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,919
um in this case the email is more

161
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,800
advanced than awareness training covered

162
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
so people still click because they think

163
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
it's legit and it was not covered in

164
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,440
awareness training

165
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
and the last one is the recipient was

166
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,759
distracted at the moment and this is

167
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,639
yeah just like normal human behavior

168
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,280
um so when i

169
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
have well i don't have it but if someone

170
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,319
has running kits around the house we had

171
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
to work from home there was a lockdown

172
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,680
you were working you are in meetings

173
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,319
every day every time and you have to

174
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,800
teach your or homeschool your kids at

175
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
home

176
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,599
and you still want to finish and work

177
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,160
for that day um well it could be that

178
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,919
you click on a link that you would

179
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,639
normally not do because you had decent

180
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,919
security awareness training um so that

181
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
could be an option if you have annoying

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,879
colleagues and long teams meetings so if

183
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,599
you had teams meetings all day you got a

184
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
lot of emails that day

185
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
you still need to reply on that or you

186
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,479
have to interact for it on that email

187
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,440
and you will um and you will do that in

188
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
the last 30 minutes of your work day

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
just before the weekend and you click on

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,599
something because you want to get the

191
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,520
job done well that's normal behavior and

192
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
then in that case you would click on a

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
link

194
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,719
um and the last one and that's more my

195
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,120
personal case i guess if i didn't have

196
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
my morning coffee yet and i opened my

197
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,159
laptop and check out which emails i got

198
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,720
from the the day before and the night

199
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,880
i'm scrolling through it and think okay

200
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,120
you i can delete this the latest oh i

201
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
have to log in on this okay fine

202
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
um so that could also be a possibility

203
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,720
while you click or interact on an email

204
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,760
because you're just distracted or tired

205
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
or

206
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
any other case that you

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,839
will click on a link that is still

208
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,839
human

209
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,279
behavior um

210
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,160
so

211
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
we got a lot of emails every day and

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
especially in these days where we have

213
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,480
confidence working from home i guess

214
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,560
everything is an email well it's good

215
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,040
that not ever it's good that team's

216
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
meetings are converted to emails instead

217
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
of having teams meetings all day but you

218
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
got a lot of emails everybody emails

219
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
everything because you don't speak each

220
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,600
other

221
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,480
at the office so you got a lot of emails

222
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
all day and you have to

223
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,399
do something with that do something with

224
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,120
it um so you scroll through your emails

225
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,640
and you have to

226
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,000
decide uh in a split second if it's a

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
legit email or if it's not an illegit

228
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
email so there's a lot of going on in

229
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,360
your head when you're scrolling through

230
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,000
your emails and and decide to interact

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,959
with them or not so in that split second

232
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,680
you make the decision is this email

233
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,279
legit or not

234
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,160
and um well if you look further in the

235
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
psychology um

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,720
dr cadamon

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
has defined two systems in your brain

238
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
system one and system two for decision

239
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
making and there is a big difference

240
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,079
between those two systems the first

241
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,240
system the system one

242
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
is able to make a decisions

243
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
98 of the time and the other two percent

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
is for system two and system one is just

245
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
the automatic and subconscious actions

246
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,760
you need to take so okay

247
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,640
um

248
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,440
my alarm goes off i will wake up and go

249
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
out of bed it's automatic because you

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,720
have to you have to do it every day and

251
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,959
it's like a routine uh you're not

252
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,600
thinking okay this is my alarm should i

253
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
wake up or not should i go out of bed no

254
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,079
because you have to do this every day

255
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,519
it's a routine

256
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,920
and the next one uh the system two is

257
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
more a controlled and conscious way of

258
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
thinking and decision making so you

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
really think about it and

260
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
and you're you're thinking about every

261
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,200
uh possible uh option um for this um

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
thinking about you

263
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,040
if you want to do it or not so that's to

264
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,160
control the conscious uh way of thinking

265
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,040
um

266
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
and we as people prefer to make it as

267
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,800
efficient as possible so we create

268
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
routines and shortcuts so um if we do

269
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,519
something more than once or every day

270
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
just like emails we make a routine so we

271
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
go through it

272
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,880
and we make shortcuts because we learn

273
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
from experiences and if

274
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,279
we know that um office or google emails

275
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,079
are legit um our head makes a shortcut

276
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,800
to it and says okay this is legit

277
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
um and that's that's what's happening in

278
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
your head every day when opening email

279
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,680
and if we talk about shortcuts i'm

280
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,440
definitely not talking about this

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
shortcut

282
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
but it's still really cool it's my

283
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,519
favorite one

284
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,880
um

285
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,760
but

286
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
to make that decision making even easier

287
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
for you

288
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,639
cyber criminals use the use the

289
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
influence principles to make decision

290
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
making easier

291
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
so if

292
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
i am a cyber criminal i know you need to

293
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,959
to make decisions every day it's legit

294
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,040
or not so why not use influence

295
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
principles to make it easier so for

296
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,639
example use emotion in the email so you

297
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,160
react from re from emotion uh to that

298
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,760
email um

299
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
so well maybe you interact interact with

300
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,000
my email and in that case i will um i

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
will infect your computer and theref

302
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,120
welder see it's it's it's defined by

303
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
ciardini um there are more

304
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
uh principles of influence but i

305
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
highlighted five of them because they

306
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
have used in fishing

307
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,600
uh and these five i will show a couple

308
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,320
of examples of them um how they were

309
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
well used in in phishing emails

310
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
so this is the first one and it's called

311
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,519
it's called the principle of

312
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,200
reciprocation

313
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,560
so that means this uh principle is that

314
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,360
if i do something for you you would do

315
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
something for me

316
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,720
and this is um displayed in this email

something for me i want to do something

338
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,880
back and this is one of uh one of the uh

339
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
examples for that

340
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,880
the next one is the principle of

341
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,560
scarcity so um well it's literally that

342
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
there is um

343
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,519
an amount of time or an amount of money

344
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,480
or something like that and you have to

345
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,560
be on time to get it so in this

346
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,839
example

347
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
sir madam today hm treasury announced a

348
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,199

people and businesses through this

353
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,360

358
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
the bank of england and this is actually

359
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,839
an example of an email sent by uh by an

360
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,800
apt

361
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,199
um so what we see this email is sent

362
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,639
just before the deadline of june 26 2010

363
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,600
2020 um and they said okay we have

364
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,639
resources for you and if you are

365
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,720
clicking or if you interact or if you

366
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,880
register your business just before this

367
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,360
deadline we can give you something so

368
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
people think okay i really need to

369
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,279
interact with this email now because i

370
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,880
want this um so you see it um that there

371
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,279
there's time pressure in it but you can

372
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,399
also say okay there's only three well

373
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
the stock of three is uh is left at this

374
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
moment so you have to be quick so um

375
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,320
they asked people to interact uh in an

376
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
amount of time uh or money or or stock

377
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,839
or something um so you see that people

378
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,320
are more likely to click because they

379
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,240
think they have to act immediately

380
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,720
then the third one that's the principle

381
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,680
of authority um so in this email you see

382
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
hi sana as discussed with you yesterday

383
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,839
you must ensure that all depending

384
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,759
dealer payments shall be completed by

385
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,880
end of today you must do a hourly follow

386
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,639
up with your teams and ensure that this

387
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,959
is completed today at any cost

388
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,040
conferring to me on a figure by end of

389
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,839
today regards ceo

390
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,600
well we see there's a lot of

391
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,519
we see this a lot a lot in uh ceo fraud

392
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,560
so that you get an email from your ceo

393
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,079
for 2d cfo and asks you to transfer some

394
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,360
money by the end of the day um because

395
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,320
the ceo is somewhere in another country

396
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,759
and um if they uh well one of the

397
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
customers need their money for example

398
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,160
or need to buy something from them so

399
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,799
they ask money um from the sea about the

400
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,160
ceo asked as the cfo to transfer money

401
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,439
um and this is a in this example the ceo

402
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,599
asked to open a document that is

403
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,319
attached to this email also sent by uh

404
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,000
one other real apt with a threat another

405
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,039
trend actor um so

406
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,520
because it's sent by the ceo it's an

407
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,000
authority that people are more likely to

408
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
click or to interact uh

409
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,960
in on an email of someone who has

410
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,760
authority if it's the ceo if it's the

411
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,480
national police if it's a company that

412
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,280
everybody knows like google or facebook

413
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
if it's an authority people are more

414
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,000
likely are more likely to click on the

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
link or interact with the email because

416
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
it's sent from an authority

417
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,199
so this is uh the fourth one um

418
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
and well this is one of my favorites

419
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,160
it's uh it's uh this is an example of

420
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,640
the principle of liking um so you see

421
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,600
here dear colleague ho ho ho it's almost

422

regards santa or the holiday committee

432
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,600
um

433
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
because this is sent from the holiday

434
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
committee the committee that

435
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,360
that that arranges great branches during

436
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,559

nice gifts and and and organizes the

438
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,559
cool barbecues outside this summer uh

439
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,400
you like them and because you have

440
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
a positive association with the with the

441
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,760
holiday committee you think oh it's so

442
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
nice that they sent me a christmas

443
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
greeting i would definitely check this

444
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
out so this is the example of the

445
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,960
principle of liking you could have the

446
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,919
same

447
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,120
passion the same interest or because you

448
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,679
already have a positive feeling about

449
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
this person or about this group so

450
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,480
you're more likely to click

451
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
and then the last one um and that this

452
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,960
is also an example of uh of an action

453
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
of one of the apts covered in this

454
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
research um and i will definitely

455
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
highlight this at the end of the

456
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,400
presentation but this is the face that

457
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
linkedin uh profile of rob wilson rob

458
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,280
wilson is a person living in england and

459
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
rob wilson is sending you a message

460
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
through

461
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
linkedin dms to

462
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
redirect you to a malicious document for

463
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
example or something else

464
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
um

465
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,360
and

466
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
this person is trying to get your

467
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,120
attention or well to to get

468
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,559
to to show

469
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
you that it's a really valid a legit

470
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
person by adding your

471
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,559
uh connections on linkedin to daryl

472
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,760
linkedin so rock wilson um in this case

473
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
well not really rob wilson of course uh

474
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
sends out invites to

475
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
all the to a couple of connections of

476
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
one person the target

477
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,320
of this attack

478
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
um those people

479
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,960
uh accept the invitation because a lot

480
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,840
of people accept invitations from

481
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,919
recruiters um and they don't know who it

482
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,240
is but they accept the invitation then

483
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,280
the target or the victim is checking out

484
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,720
the uh the the linkedin page of the

485
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,520
cyber criminal in this case rob wilson

486
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,679
and sees that a lot of connections of

487
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,919
this person already are connected to

488
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
this person so because your friends or

489
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,840
your connections already think this is a

490
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,159
legit person you will also think this is

491
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,039
a legit person because you have the same

492
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,080
connections so this was used by lazarus

493
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,720
um and it's a way to convince people

494
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
that it's a legit uh legit person

495
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,880
so that's called the principle of social

496
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
proof

497
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
so these are the five

498
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,280
ways of the five principles of influence

499
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
um and if you send an email just it's

500
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,559
just well

501
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,400
a part of the email so if you send an

502
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,720
email to um to someone um the use of

503
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,559
principles of influence is a part of the

504
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
email there are way more parts of the

505
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,679
email you can have and the principle of

506
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,039
influence is

507
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,840
included in every part of the email so

508
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
if you check out okay

509
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,919
what parts of emails are there

510
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,000
are there next to the principle of

511
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
influence so if we go to an email

512
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,559
let's check out what are the options um

513
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,280
so if we send an email there is of

514
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
course a bait well if you say if we send

515
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
out a phishing email of course there is

516
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
a bait you want to get something from

517
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,640
someone so there is a link attached to

518
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,039
the email or an attachment just like i

519
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,919
covered in one of the previous slides

520
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,720
you send a link to a phishing website

521
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,799
credential harvesting login page for

522
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,000
example

523
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,880
or a download website or you might have

524
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
an attachment

525
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,600
added to the email so you can use the

526
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,640
principal influence to uh to the 2d link

527
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,120
so you register a link

528
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,840
that contains names of companies that

529
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,320
are commonly used or you use the

530
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
attachment uh

531
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,320
like a word document with uh with

532
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,559
several names uh in it that it looks

533
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,760
legit

534
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,039
um so

535
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,280
you use the principle of influence on

536
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919
those two parts of the email

537
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,120
and next to bait you have the content so

538
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
um you have you have the email and this

539
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
is like the email body

540
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
so you use principle of influence on the

541
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
language is it good language is it the

542
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,960
same language used as the as as the

543
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,679
victim uses every day is it good

544
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,919
language is it formal language or

545
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,240
informal is it the way that

546
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,159
uh people interact with each other in a

547
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,280
company for example you have to design

548
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,159
is it just plain text or does it contain

549
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,000
exact the same

550
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,280
design as google does or linkedin does

551
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,840
for example or does it use a neutral

552
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,799
um brand

553
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,720
design um

554
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
stuff like that

555
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
or just plain text something that i see

556
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,120
a lot

557
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,080
and does it contain personal information

558
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,039
um but sometimes if you want to

559
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,159
build trust with the person that is the

560
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,000
recipient of the email

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
if you include some personal information

562
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,159
it should convince someone or could

563
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,400
convince someone that it's a legitimate

564
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
email and

565
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,960
you can use the principle of well the

566
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,000
principle of influence is used um

567
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,919
um by adding personal information to see

568
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,880
that you already have a relationship

569
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
with someone because you know

570
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
information

571
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
and next to the content you also have

572
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
the context of the email so that's

573
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,960
everything around well around

574
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,039
the content of the email or the email

575
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,360
body so that's the senator who is the

576
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
senator is it someone you already know

577
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
is it a completely new

578
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,880
company is it a private person a private

579
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,000
email

580
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
address for example

581
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,840
what is the team a theme of the email um

582
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,279
is the theme

583
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,400
that it's about a local event or is it

584
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
about a shared passion or is it about

585
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,039
something that's in the recent news for

586
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,080
example and the goal if the of the email

587
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
is the goal to

588
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,720
get some information from someone or to

589
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,600
to send debate

590
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
um

591
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,640
so

592
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,559
now we know how how emails are

593
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
constructed and how the principles of

594
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,840
influence are being used on all parts of

595
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,039
an email

596
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,720
um so now it's like a classifying model

597
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,960
to um

598
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,559
well to to your classifying model to

599
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,600
research from some emails so

600
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
if we have the classifying model what's

601
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
the next thing we need to

602
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,080
do to do this research that's the

603
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,039
adversary emails data set um and that's

604
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,360
really hard actually to to get

605
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
um well how do you get an adversary

606
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
emails data set first you need to select

607
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,600
adversaries with a phishing procedure

608
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,240
there are a lot of adversaries or apts

609
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,760
threat actors that don't use phishing as

610
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,400
the way to gain initial foothold

611
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
for example when they use external

612
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,840
infrastructure

613
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,320
or when they use physical social

614
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
engineering

615
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,720
in that case well that's not interesting

616
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
for this research so you only need to

617
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
select adversaries with the phishing

618
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,960
procedure miter tech framework also have

619
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,919
an extensive list with all the

620
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,320
all the apts and adversaries that use

621
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,720
the phishing procedure and some examples

622
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,559
of it

623
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
so um

624
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
if you do that well there are

625
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
there are of course a lot of

626
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,919
possible groups that that can do this so

627
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,799
if we have or if in general if we need

628
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,520
to send out a phishing email for an

629
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
adversary emulation we first do the

630
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,320
threat intel uh part and the threat

631
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,279
empower

632
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,320
the most

633
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,480
important groups for tread intel to see

634
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,760
what's the biggest threat is the insider

635
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
threat the crime group the nation state

636
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,640
and the nation state um

637
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,000
i left out the insider threat in this

638
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,159
in this research because if if it's an

639
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,559
insider threat yes of course it can

640
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,640
still fish but it doesn't have the

641
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,919
characteristics of an apt for example

642
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
when sending out those emails

643
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,760
unless they're working together but

644
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,559
that's

645
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,279
that's a great uh great part so i

646
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,480
selected crime groups and nation states

647
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
that use um

648
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
this fishing procedure

649
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,279
so um when thinking okay what are the

650
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,159
most

651
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,840
efficient well the the most important

652
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,559
groups to use in this research to use

653
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
during our next adversary emulation

654
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
um i divided them in

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,279
the size

656
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,600
uh how advanced they are but also where

657
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,760
they're from so i selected ta 505 apt 28

658
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,720
apt 40 and apt 38

659
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,159
um

660
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
and

661
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,679
when i selected these groups i went to

662
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,159
search from for search for emails um and

663
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,039
um i needed a lot of emails to do some

664
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,840
analysis so i did a part of automated

665
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,760
analysis so i needed emails and msgs

666
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,799
and i got more than 200 of them

667
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,120
i got them by using the threat

668
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,720
intelligence

669
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
department for example but also did a

670
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,279
lot of hunting uh on virustotal for

671
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,039
example

672
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,240
um and next to that um i got a lot of

673
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,039
screenshots from research done by other

674
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,679
brilliant cyber security companies and

675
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,559
they said they they put the screenshots

676
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,880
of the phishing emails that were

677
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,600
the uh way to get initial foothold to

678
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,240
the network of some really big

679
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,360
hacking

680
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,159
exercises and those screenshots were

681
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,200
also uh well uh what was it copy from

682
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,600
the research to analyze them not

683
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,840
automated

684
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,720
unfortunately but

685
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
these were used to enrich my um

686
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,720
already existing data set

687
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,520
and next to those emails the emls the

688
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,720
msgs and the screenshots i also use the

689
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,360
associated iocs

690
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,799
iocs like domains malicious documents

691
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,320
etc

692
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
because if you

693
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,720
see that you see an email you can also

694
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
sometimes the domain is blurred out and

695
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
you can use the domains in

696
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,640
pages that are uh that that contain um

697
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,840
iocs like domains for it

698
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,760
and you can also use it for this

699
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,799
research

700
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,520
so that's the way the adversary email

701
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,200
data set is built

702
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,679
okay we have the email

703
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,440
we have the emails we have the data set

704
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,279
we have the information we have the

705
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,799
classifying

706
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,120
model for the email so now we can apply

707
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
that classifying model on all these

708
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
emails

709
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
so

710
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
like i said i divided them in uh for

711
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,039
well i chose four groups and i use these

712
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,000
four groups uh based on their location

713
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,399
on the world map um because sometimes

714
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,320
someone only wants to emulate an

715
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,039
adversary coming from russia sometimes

716
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,640
from china or another place so uh

717
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,559
i didn't want to choose

718
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,159
only from one uh geographical location

719
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,440
but shows multiple instead

720
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,159
so the first one is russia

721
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,480
so

722
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,200
um then we go to the first group coming

723
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,559
from russia

724
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,799
and the first group coming from russia

725
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,799
uh i chose is uh ta505

726
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,919
and i call them uh

727
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,600
lazy mode and i will tell you because um

728
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
i will tell you why i i called this

729
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,840
group lazy boats

730
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,679
so i called them lazy group because

731
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,159
they're not really an influencer so if

732
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,559
you look at their emails and there are a

733
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,159
lot of emails

734
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,360
from tf 505 of course it's not a real

735
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
apt it's a cyber crime group so they

736
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,720
send out a lot of emails um

737
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,399
to everyone to uh deploy ransomware for

738
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,080
for example and then um and then ask for

739
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,440
a lot of money

740
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,360
so they send a lot of emails it's not

741
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
really spearfishing more more like a

742
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,159
spam campaign so they're not really an

743
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
influencer they just send out a lot of

744
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,720
emails and let's see who clicks and

745
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,200
everyone who clicks will give a lot of

746
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,159
money uh to this group and if not

747
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,080
clicked then we send out a lot of other

748
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,760
emails so they're not really an

749
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,039
influencer

750
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,080
uh if i check out those email bodies or

751
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,399
the subjects a lot of um

752
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,880
text i see is this email is sent

753
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,559
automatically

754
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,320
well that's it wait then with an

755
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,399
attachment attached to it

756
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,760
next one please see attachment that's it

757
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,480
with an attachment like a word document

758
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,120
or an excel document

759
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,440
these emails are impersonal so they can

760
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
be sent to anyone while you already saw

761
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,760
it if you check out these two email

762
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
bodies or subjects these these are

763
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,159
impersonal can be sent to everyone they

764
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,240
use the same scenario every time

765
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,039
and what i think is really funny but

766
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,480
also

767
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
well not really surprising is that the

768
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,279
sender email address is not matching the

769
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,720
sender name of uh the of the email

770
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,559
um and they have

771
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,960
html or maldoc as an attachment

772
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,039
sometimes hosted on a website so they

773
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,559
use html attachments or maldox and i'll

774
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,600
show you a couple of examples of of this

775
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,880
email

776
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,000
these are three examples of this email

777
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,880
and what i said is that the sender email

778
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,519
address is not matching the sender name

779
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,399
so you see three emails sent from

780
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,200
rv krishna prasad and you see three

781
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,159
different email addresses so what this

782
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,360
group does is that they um

783
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,919
well they they got email credentials

784
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,720
from

785
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,000
from someone they um have a business

786
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,640
compromise and then they send out

787
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,880
phishing emails from that account to

788
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,279
other people but only change the sender

789
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,000
name so then it looks like it's sent

790
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,880
from krishna prasad but it doesn't match

791
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,519
the centered email address and it is

792
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,519
this is a well

793
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,080
this is an okay uh way to do it because

794
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,679
if you already uh compromised um email

795
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,480
addresses of email accounts in that case

796
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,720
if you send it from that email account

797
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,200
then it will circumvent the spam filter

798
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,519
for example because it's just a legit

799
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,720
email

800
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,720
so um what i said this is this these are

801
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,840
examples of emails from

802
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,279
ta505 what i also see is that they for

803
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,360
example use um emails uh send with the

804
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,000
theme like uh i want to share a onedrive

805
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,399
document with you please click this link

806
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,279
so i see links in and in the email and i

807
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,000
see attachment in the email uh mostly

808
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,239
maldox

809
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,480
attached to the email

810
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,800
so the next one so we're still in russia

811
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,679
but we shifted from ta 505 which is a

812
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
crime group to a more sophisticated

813
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,520
group called apt-28 and what i see is

814
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,000
that apt-2i28

815
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,679
uses the principle of liking and

816
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,359
authority so what they use is uh for

817
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,040
example authority because they copy

818
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,399
emails and email templates from

819
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,239
from organizations we know um

820
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,040
so

821
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,839
we already have a trust with um or they

822
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,800
send it from the ceo um

823
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,079
or someone in the organization with a

824
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,679
really good position

825
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,639
um

826
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,359
so they use it from external so like

827
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,599
google a known company so they send out

828
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,079
an email and make it look like it's sent

829
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,240
from an external company or they send it

830
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,720
from an internal company so for example

831
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,599
an email is sent by a ceo or someone in

832
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
the upper management and in that case

833
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,599
the email address is spoofed so it looks

834
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,359
like the email is sent from your

835
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,480
colleague

836
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,359
um so the copied corporate identity so

837
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,280
if it's from an external company then

838
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,240
you just use for example the

839
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,800
the template that google uses or they

840
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,520
use plain text in their emails

841
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,119
so it's just

842
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
well just like i said just plain text

843
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,520
normally a lot of organizations also use

844
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,359
plain text

845
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,440
in their email body so it's not really

846
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
surprising that they're also using plain

847
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,119
text

848
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,000
and what i saw when i

849
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,440
um

850
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,839
when i checked out the the domains is

851
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,839
that they use a lot of type of squad

852
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,640
domains with predictable patterns like

853
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,480
they use the nato so that they use nato

854
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,920
dash ins dot com instead of nato.ind or

855
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,520
that they use

856
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
uh for example something with office 365

857
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,760
in the name so you see that they used

858
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,599
words of

859
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,280
commonly known

860
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
organizations that did they put these

861
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,599
names in their domain names

862
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,520
so they replace subdomains for example

863
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,000
by a dash so if you have a sub domain

864
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,240
like

865
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,680
mail.google.com that they use mail dash

866
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,920
google.com for example

867
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,560
um and they use cld in the domain i

868
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,200
choose another dld uh just like i said

869
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,800
with the um

870
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,160
whitney nato uh example

871
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,040
and this is a very common uh

872
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,599
a very known email this is what you this

873
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,480
was used to send to someone from the

874
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,880
campaign team of hillary clinton so this

875
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,640
is a copy of

876
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,240
the google email that was sent if

877
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,800
if there was an alert on your google

878
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
account

879
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,560
or they use something like this so they

880
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,000
used a current theme or current event

881
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,760
that's actual

882
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,480
and

883
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,359
they try to influence you or to get you

884
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,119
into clicking on a document by using um

885
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,040
information that's relevant to you but

886
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,760
you see that it's mostly a plain text or

887
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,640
almost plain text

888
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,520
so then we go to the next one so we have

889
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,640
russia now we are going to china

890
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,880
they also have an apt

891
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,240
and i use apt40 i don't know if they

892
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,480
still send out emails because it wasn't

893
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,680
in news last summer that some people

894
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,839
were not really active anymore uh

895
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,640
because they found the

896
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,160
most well possibly the people

897
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,760
responsible for these

898
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,359
hacking campaigns

899
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,079
but apt-40 uses the principle of liking

900
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,000
and uses relevant themes for the

901
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,200
recipient so what i see is a local event

902
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,160
in

903
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,480
the in the neighborhood of the person

904
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,640
who receives the email from apt40

905
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,680
and

906
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,640
maybe

907
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
something that was in the news that's

908
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,160
relevant for the recipient so they

909
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,800
look into who is the recipient who is

910
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,520
the possible victim and creates a

911
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,320
scenario that's relevant for them so

912
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,760
that's why they're using the principle

913
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,880
of liking because they use a scenario

914
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,040
that's relevant and that might

915
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,040
be a good one for the recipient

916
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,520
so what i said they use the local news

917
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,800
activities and events so that's what i

918
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,920
mostly saw in the emails um so they

919
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,800
profile victims by using open sources so

920
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,880
if you have a linkedin page or something

921
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,760
else social media

922
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,599
you have articles on the internet they

923
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,320
use this information to profile the

924
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
victim and make a relevant scenario for

925
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,359
them

926
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,520
um and the emails vary because i saw

927
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,800
some emails that had a lot of typos and

928
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,720
sometimes i see an email that's well

929
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,240
crafted mostly it's in english and what

930
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
i see is that sometimes the first

931
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,280
initial email that is sent to the to to

932
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,760
the victim is well crafted and if the

933
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,240
victim responds to it or replies then um

934
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,160
for example asking for help because they

935
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,640
have to enable macros and they ask why

936
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,599
it should

937
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,320
why they shoot animal macros you see

938
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,480
that if they respond to that that there

939
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
are a lot of typos so that my this might

940
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,960
indicate that there's someone involved

941
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,720
in creating the first initial email and

942
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,839
then

943
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,920
then they reply by themselves and it's

944
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,760
not really good english that could be a

945
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
possibility

946
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,240
um and if you check what kind of bait is

947
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,320
added to the email you see that more

948
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,760
docs

949
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,000
are added in the attachment

950
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,640
they use more than only word for example

951
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,079
also publisher

952
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,320
or they host it

953
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,400
their maldox on google drive and send a

954
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,079
link to a google drive document

955
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
also what you see is that you can

956
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
download the legit dock on our external

957
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,400
website and when you well actually

958
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,079
download uh a malware and with a payload

959
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,839
and if it's executed you will be

960
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,240
redirected to a legit document so people

961
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,560
won't get suspicious

962
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,160
so that's what we see for apt-40 uh most

963
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,599
of the time

964
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,400
and then the last one um and there's a

965
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,760
really really small dot on the uh on the

966
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,560
map but it's personally my favorite if

967
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,280
you can have a favorite apt i don't know

968
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,839
uh for sending phishing emails this

969
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,920
would be my favorite and it's in north

970
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,000
korea and that's apt 38 also called

971
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,240
lazarus and these know how to

972
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,680
fish and how to do stuff they built they

973
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
built full characters uh or

974
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,319
impersonating real people they're using

975
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,760
email they're using linkedin telegram or

976
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
twitter to build build their full

977
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,880
scenario

978
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,359
so what you see is that they think okay

979
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,839
what's relevant for the person i already

980
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,040
showed you the uh screenshot of

981
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,000
rob wilson that's linkedin a linkedin

982
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,200
profile

983
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,280
that's made by lazarus so they made a

984
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,359
linkedin profile

985
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,040
having a chat with with the victim

986
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,079
build

987
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,040
build trust gain trust from the person

988
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,000
and then they switch to telegram um to

989
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
uh to negotiate for example or to have

990
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,280
more uh have a more chat about a

991
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,000
possible job they also use twitter like

992
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,680
uh um

993
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,839
like all the security or a couple of

994
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,640
security researchers got there uh got a

995
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,680
message from this group uh with a visual

996
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,040
studio project so uh i got attacked by a

997
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,000
north korean apt and all i got was this

998
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,119
lousy visual studio projector is in

999
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,520
place they'll be using a lot of

1000
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,359
different

1001
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,680
media or

1002
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,520
platforms to send out this information

1003
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
um and most of the time it's important

1004
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,440
value for the recipient so

1005
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,480
um

1006
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,640
if you send an email or send a message

1007
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
to a security researcher then a new

1008
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,880
project is really relevant uh if you

1009
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,440
send out emails to someone who's looking

1010
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,400
for a job that's also relevant so they

1011
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,800
check out what's relevant for the

1012
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,440
recipient

1013
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,319
um and what's also

1014
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,400
used is that they spoof email addresses

1015
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,480
or create an unknown company

1016
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,359
so they use the email addresses from

1017
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,480
people they know and send emails from

1018
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,720
that email addresses or they just create

1019
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,040
a random unknown company

1020
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,839
well

1021
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,760
i would be i wouldn't be surprised if i

1022
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,480
get

1023
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,720
a message from a recruiter with a really

1024
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,599
random recruitment company name i i see

1025
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,280
a lot of random recruitment company

1026
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,560
names so if someone sends me a job offer

1027
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,040
from that company named well i think you

1028
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,680
don't uh google every recruitment

1029
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,160
company and also another free legit

1030
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,480
recruitment company is listed on the

1031
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,440
internet

1032
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,599
so they create an unknown company and

1033
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,319
create a couple of um

1034
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,119
real

1035
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,240
um linkedin pages for it and and people

1036
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,680
for it so they really build

1037
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,319
a character and company for it

1038
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,760
and what you see is that they use

1039
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
dropbox or onedrive for delivering

1040
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,760
malware uh to the 2d victim so they

1041
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
upload dropbox

1042
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,240
documents on dropbox for example or on

1043
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,400
onedrive and then share it with people

1044
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,880
that's really smart because it won't end

1045
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,800
up being a spam filter for example so

1046
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,760
that's uh that's nice

1047
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,040
and um

1048
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,760
what i also see if you look at the text

1049
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,200
they adapt to the language of the um of

1050
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,839
the person receiving the information for

1051
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,000
example south korea

1052
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,240
and

1053
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,000
and they use the form of speech but it's

1054
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,960
not uh always flawless um

1055
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,560
and that for

1056
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,720
for an apt is really good at fishing

1057
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,920
they're still not flawless so this is an

1058
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,560
example i also showed the linkedin

1059
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,960
profile for wilson so here you see an

1060
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,839
example that rob wilson sends an a

1061
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,040
message a linkedin a direct message to

1062
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,240
uh to the victim um and as hi i'd like

1063
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
to chat with you for a new job

1064
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,119
opportunity so this is the way to gain

1065
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,400
trust um in the first place and when

1066
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,160
trust is game then they switch to

1067
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,720
telegram and what they did is that they

1068
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,760
asked the person to connect to a box to

1069
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,000
show if someone

1070
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,720
has the right skills for this job and

1071
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,400
use this as a way to compromise a person

1072
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,599
would you see that they're really

1073
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,640
creative and not only using

1074
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,440
an email with with an attachment but

1075
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,800
they really

1076
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,520
put a lot of effort in the scenarios and

1077
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,240
send it to the people receiving the

1078
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,920
scenarios

1079
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,480
so yes this is uh this is one of my

1080
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,960
favorites because they really put so

1081
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,359
much effort in building scenarios that

1082
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,280
it's well that's that's awesome well

1083
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,040
awesome i don't think that's the right

1084
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,200
word but this is an example of an apt

1085
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,119
using the principles of influence

1086
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,280
they're really influenced and they use

1087
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,640
almost every principle of influence to

1088
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,119
gain trust from the um

1089
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,400
from

1090
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,880
from the victim and this uh

1091
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,599
this is uh based on uh

1092
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,720
already uh all research already done by

1093
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,800
some companies

1094
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,000
so during your next adversary emulation

1095
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,680
i want to ask you to not just grab the

1096
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,079
default scenario from the shelf

1097
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,560
of course as a pen testing company red

1098
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,200
team company you probably have a full

1099
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,000
list of fishing scenarios you can use

1100
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,079
every time and will be successful for

1101
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,119
example in an office 365 migration

1102
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,960
scenario

1103
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,680
of course that's nice to use it and you

1104
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,240
know that it's successful but next time

1105
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,280
i would ask you to not craft a default

1106
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,680
scenario but create something yourself

1107
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,079
if you have to write a report and you

1108
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,200
say that you just use a default scenario

1109
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,480
well i don't know what

1110
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,359
it's okay but it's so much cooler to use

1111
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,480
real world examples of these fishing

1112
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,359
scenarios um so please be inspired by

1113
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,440
these characteristics and be more

1114
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,920
creative it's super cool if you can fish

1115
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,480
someone during a red team or an

1116
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,720
adversary emulation that is really

1117
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,359
inspired by that apt that you're trying

1118
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,800
to emulate

1119
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,599
and i think it really adds more value to

1120
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,280
your adversary emulation to also use

1121
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,440
these phishing scenarios next to the

1122
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,800
techniques you

1123
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,480
used in your attack

1124
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,880
chain for example

1125
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,760
um

1126
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,480
and influenced by contented context if

1127
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,040
simulating a serious apt so

1128
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,000
be inspired by uh how they name the

1129
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,359
domain names for example be inspired by

1130
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,760
how they craft their emails if there's a

1131
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,720
good language if there's a design in it

1132
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,000
for example

1133
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,559
um and of course i know that there is a

1134
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,599
difference in time and effort um if i

1135
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,040
was a real adversary i would have

1136
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,920
time

1137
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,960
money

1138
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,400
to to attack someone maybe i'll take two

1139
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,720
years to attack someone with a lot of

1140
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,160
people and of course i know that during

1141
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,200
adversary emulation you don't have that

1142
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,040
time even if it's not low and slow um

1143
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,960
but you only have a couple of weeks or

1144
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,359
maybe a couple of months to do this

1145
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,839
adversary emulation i know that's their

1146
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,079
difference and then it's easy to fall

1147
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,000
back to the default scenario that you

1148
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,960
know that already works but please i

1149
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,440
would ask you to be more creative and if

1150
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,599
you have something really nice

1151
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,319
definitely share it with me

1152
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,240
and now i said a lot of things during

1153
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,760
this presentation about fishing

1154
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,599
characteristics and how fishing meals

1155
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,800
were crafted but i got a list of every

1156
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,280
characteristic

1157
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,079
used by apt so by the russian state

1158
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,640
actor 1828 chinese

1159
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,839
espionage group apt-40 north korean

1160
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,160
state actor apt-38 and a russian

1161
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,680
criminal group ta505 so i made a list

1162
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,160
with every part of the email that i

1163
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,040
covered in this presentation and i said

1164
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,920
which

1165
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,640
choices were made by apts

1166
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,040
so you can go to this page and you see

1167
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
those four groups with all the

1168
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,240
characteristics and with more examples

1169
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,119
of how they did it

1170
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,920
