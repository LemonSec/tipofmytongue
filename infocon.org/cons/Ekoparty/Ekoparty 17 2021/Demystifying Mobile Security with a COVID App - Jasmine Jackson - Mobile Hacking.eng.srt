1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,160
hello and thank you for attending my

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
talk today demystifying mobile security

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,360
with the covet app i'm so glad that

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
you're here to attend my talk

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,279
i first met i first met the founders and

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,240
creators of the echo party conference

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,600
when i presented at not pete con

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
in buenos aires in 2019

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,640
and i fell in love with the conference

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,719
in argentina and i'm so glad that they

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
thought of me to present at this

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,399
conference so

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,280
just to give a bit of background on how

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,440
i came up with this topic last um

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,760
this previous summer this past summer

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
excuse me i participated

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
in the defcon biohacking village i

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
created mobile challenges for their ctf

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,320
and i'm also interested in mobile

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
security so

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,040
i thought what better way to talk about

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,119
mobile security through the lens of a

23
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,479
covert app

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
and a

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
subject that is prevalent in our current

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,520
times with everything that's going on

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,040
with the pandemic

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
so let's get started

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,119
who am i

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,119
well as i said my name is jasmine

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
jackson

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,880
my focus is in web application security

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
with the secondary focus and mobile

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,000
security

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
when i'm not

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
hacking websites or fiddling with

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
devices

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
i like to play vintage video games on my

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,520
retropie

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,920
and if you would like to reach out to me

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
my handle is the fluffy 007 on all

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
social media platforms

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,960
so

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
the agenda for this talk

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,640
will be y mobile and we will do that by

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
looking at threat vectors

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,840
after that we will do a interactive

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,719
portion of mobile security where we will

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,159
actually reverse engineer the covert app

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
then i will discuss

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
the results that i found

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
from inside the covet app and

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,200
i will conclude the talk with continued

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,080
learning if you find mobile security

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
interesting and you want to continue on

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,440
in your journey

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
so let's continue on with threat vectors

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,200
now

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,840
most times with mobile devices and i'm

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
charging my phone so that's what this

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,959
piece is here

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,879
most times

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
people do not look at their mobile

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,239
device as a mini computer but you should

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,440
think of it as a mini computer because

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,200
it stores data caches data

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
it does pretty much everything that a

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
computer does most people when they use

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
their mobile device they use it to take

70
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,040
pictures video

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
go on apps such as instagram tick tock

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
facebook twitter

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
keep in contact with their friends

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,360
possibly check their bank account

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,640
statements

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
and while you're doing that you're

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
really not thinking of is my information

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
being saved or

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,360
you know

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
what happens to my data

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
so this slide by now secure

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
illustrates

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
all the different attack vectors that

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
can happen with mobile devices

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
and of course i can't explain all of

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,959
these threat vectors because that will

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
take me a long time but i will explain a

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
few and the first i will explain is sms

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,319
phishing and the top left under phone

90
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,519
sms

91
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,360
so sms is texting so this is a phishing

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
attack through text

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
so an example of this is and i was a

94
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
victim of it

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,840
is i received a text message stating

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,439
congratulations you won a hundred dollar

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,319
gift card this is t-mobile

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,200
and automatically i knew

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,519
this was a problem because

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,920
a i didn't do anything to warrant a

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
hundred dollar gift card and then b

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,279
looking at the number i have a general

103
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,918
idea of what the t-mobile number looks

104
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,120
like and this number i never saw before

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,840
so i figured hm this is a phishing

106
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
attack and that was right so with this

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,520
type of attack the attacker is thinking

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
on you the victim

109
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,520
to be so enamored with oh i won a gift

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,479
card

111
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,360
so i'm going to be so fixated on that

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
i'm going to click the link

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,840
to redeem my reward that i'm not going

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
to pay attention to

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
a broken link or the number not looking

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,280
kosher or right it's just you're just so

117
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
fixated on getting the

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
reward that is not there

119
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
another threat vector

120
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
and their system

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
is rooting android routing in ios

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
jailbreak so

123
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,160
when you're using your mobile device

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,639
you're using it as a standard user and

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,479
that was done by design so mobile device

126
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,479
manufacturers

127
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,039
created this concept to where

128
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,400
you don't

129
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
destroy your mobile device so

130
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
when you use your device you're using it

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
as so you don't harm your device you

132
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
know so

133
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,759
you can't delete important files you

134
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,759
know that would make your system

135
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,960
inoperable but there is a way that you

136
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
could circumvent this

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,400
protection

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
and that is the concept of rooting or

139
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
jailbreaking

140
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
and by doing this you're saying hey i

141
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
know this is the protection to where i

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,759
don't

143
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,319
destroy my phone but i want to

144
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,520
circumvent that or remove that and i

145
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,560
want to use my phone at its full

146
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,280
potential which means i can delete

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,039
system files i can modify system files

148
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,120
and as i said before

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
by doing this if you're not careful you

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,319
can make your phone inoperable meaning

151
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
you can destroy your phone

152
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,120
and fun fact if your phone is under

153
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
warranty and you root or jailbreak your

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
device

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
you have essentially

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
invalidated your warranty so do not root

157
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,240
or jailbreak your main device

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
if you are going to do

159
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,840
mobile testing

160
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,280
get another device strictly for testing

161
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,720
do not do this on your main day-to-day

162
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,759
device

163
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,479
and as i said i was only going to

164
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
explain a few threat vectors if you

165
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,599
would like to know more i have provided

166
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,240
a link at the bottom of the slide from

167
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,520
now secure which describes how they came

168
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,319
with the different sections and goes

169
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,720
into a little bit of the different

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,199
threat vectors

171
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,080
so

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
this talk is

173
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
only on android so ios users don't come

174
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,240
with me with pitchforks like you must

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,759
talk about apple products this talk is

176
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
only android so why

177
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
well android is open source and severely

178
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,479
fragmented

179
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
so what does that mean mobile providers

180
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
can add custom code on top of the

181
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
android operating system for specific

182
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,880
devices so going back to my mobile

183
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,639
device this is a samsung a32 and as i

184
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
said i am with t-mobile so theoretically

185
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,199
i can have a friend who also has a

186
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,599
samsung a32 but they're with verizon and

187
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
even though we have the same phone

188
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,000
samsung a32

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
since our providers are different

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
t-mobile and verizon our phones could be

191
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
different because the providers could

192
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,400
add custom code on top of our devices so

193
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
why is this important well it can lead

194
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
to interoperability issues

195
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,599
so as a researcher

196
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
your tingly hat should be going off

197
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,280
right it should be pinging like hey so

198
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,680
there's ways that even though i have the

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
same device

200
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
but depending on

201
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
different parameters i can have the

202
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,399
phone do

203
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,440
different things right it's not uniform

204
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,880
so for attackers you know that's good

205
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,200
for them because it's like hey

206
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
you know i can it's you know delay of

207
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
the land

208
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,440
now

209
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
we have

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
come to the second part of the

211
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,920
presentation where it is the

212
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,640
interactive part so let's get to that

213
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
okay

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
now

215
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
we're in a virtual machine intro to

216
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,240
android security and this is a virtual

217
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
machine that i created that has the

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,839
common android hacking tools at one

219
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,720
place

220
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
and this is

221
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
created this virtual machine was created

222
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,640
on top of ubuntu 18.04

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
or bionic beaver

224
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,519
so just to look at it very quickly

225
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,480
i added the folder dynamic analysis

226
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
where we can look at the android app

227
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
while it's running

228
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,160
manual analysis looking at the app when

229
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
it's not running

230
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,519
penetration testing

231
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
looking at the app

232
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
looking at the web server of the app

233
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
because remember looking at the threat

234
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,200
vector slide from now secure

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
with apps

236
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,080
there are a web server portion

237
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
programming some of the programming

238
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
languages python sqlite for databases

239
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,279
reporting because documentation matters

240
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
you got to have good documentation when

241
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
you're looking at this reverse

242
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
engineering which we'll be talking about

243
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
later

244
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,320
and

245
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
i should note inside of this virtual

246
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,560
machine

247
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
i have insecure apps inside of the

248
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
documents folder now

249
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,000
if you download the

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
virtual machine from sourceforge

251
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,959
there's um

252
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,320
the organizers of echo party the echo

253
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,920
party conference

254
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,120
should be able to provide a link to

255
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
that shoot

256
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
now if you download

257
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
the

258
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
now if you download the virtual machine

259
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,640
your documents folder will look

260
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,640
different from mine because i have other

261
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,399
apps that i play with

262
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,120
and don't worry the echo party

263
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,760
organizers should provide you a link on

264
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,000
how to download the

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
this virtual machine

266
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
so as i said i have insecure apps inside

267
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
of this virtual machine in the documents

268
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,839
folder and the my copit app is in the

269
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
documents folder

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
but first

271
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
let's look at the mic look at the kovad

272
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,839
app

273
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,880
so

274
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
i pulled up another virtual machine

275
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,880
that is

276
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,760
a android emulator and it's called

277
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
android x86

278
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
and this

279
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,320
virtual machine is cool because

280
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,800
with mobile security you should

281
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
theoretically have a physical device but

282
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,560
if you cannot have a physical device you

283
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,839
can use an actual emulator and i'm using

284
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,560
this now android x86

285
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,680
and it emulates a android device the

286
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,720
operating system is using its android um

287
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
the oreo android operating system

288
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
it has bluetooth

289
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,480
and

290
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,279
it's you know really good

291
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,920
and it emulates uh android device as i

292
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,279
said

293
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,160
so if we click the six dots and we click

294
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,040
on the my covet

295
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,880
icon now

296
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,760
the app is really not called my covet i

297
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,639
just changed the name to give a little

298
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,680
more anonymity

299
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
and

300
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,800
it's inside of a virtual machine so it's

301
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,920
thinking sorry

302
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
i'm waiting for it to come up

303
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
great so it's welcome to my covert and

304
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,920
again that's not the name of the app the

305
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,480
official exposure app and it says in

306
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,959
order for the app to work you'll need to

307
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,760
enable exposure notifications and

308
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,880
bluetooth on your device but before you

309
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,839
do we invite you to learn more about how

310
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,480
it works so let's click on the how it

311
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,279
works button

312
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,360
anonymous tokens let's learn about the

313
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
app let's learn how the app works

314
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
through an example

315
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,079
mia and jacob did don't know each other

316
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
but they end up next to each other in a

317
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,040
long line at the grocery store and start

318
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,000
talking

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,079
they both have the app enabled on their

320
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
phones so while they are near one

321
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,720
another their phones exchange anonymous

322
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
tokens over bluetooth bluetooth must

323
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,079
remain enabled for the app to work

324
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,760
each token is a string of random letters

325
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,639
and numbers which which changes every 10

326
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,519
to 20 minutes these anonymous tokens are

327
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,839
never linked to their identities or

328
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
locations because these exchanges happen

329
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,440
every few minutes their devices can

330
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
remember how long they were near one

331
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,079
another the tokens are never linked to

332
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,360
mia or jacob's location or identity

333
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,760
their phones also record the bluetooth

334
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,320
signal strength of their exchanges in

335
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
order to estimate

336
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,360
distance

337
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
the information from these exchanges is

338
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,199
stored only on their phones

339
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,279
a week later jacob has been feeling sick

340
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,600
and was tested for cover 19. the test

341
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,240
came back positive poor jacob

342
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,880
he obtained a pin from his local health

343
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
department to enter into the app this

344
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
pen is used to prevent false reports

345
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,480
jacob decides to share his results to

346
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
help others know if they might be at

347
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,680
risk when jacob shares his positive test

348
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,320
results through the app as well as the

349
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,639
date of his test or when his symptoms

350
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,279
first started his phone uploads the

351
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,399
anonymous tokens from the past 14 days

352
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,560
mia's phone occasionally downloads the

353
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
tokens that others uploaded after

354
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
positive test results her phone then

355
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
scans them and discovers that mia have

356
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
come into close contact with the person

357
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,240
who has tested positive for coping 19

358
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
while that person was infectious

359
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
using the duration and signal strength

360
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,639
of that exposure the app determines if

361
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
the exposure meets a risk level set

362
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,839
by the app based on the latest covid 19

363
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,199
research

364
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,120
since her device estimates

365
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
that she may be at risk mia's app sends

366
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,959
her a notification of a possible

367
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,160
exposure by tapping on the notification

368
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,360
she can follow the app guidance on how

369
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000
to best protect herself and those around

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,680
her

371
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,880
so that is the example of how the app

372
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,839
works

373
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
so i wanted to show this very quickly to

374
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
just describe

375
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,680
a little bit about android emulators

376
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,079
just in case if you're like hey i can't

377
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,680
get a actual physical device don't fret

378
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
you can use the emulator and if you

379
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,720
download the intro to android security

380
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
virtual machine i also have a copy of

381
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
this android x86

382
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,880
as well so you can get both on my

383
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
sourceforge website

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
now going back to the intro to android

385
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,639
security virtual machine

386
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
let's start talking about the tools that

387
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,079
i used

388
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,199
to actually analyze the covet app

389
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,199
the first is

390
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,880
called apk tool and that's listed under

391
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,079
manual analysis but i am going to access

392
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,720
it through the command line

393
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
and i'm going to make this bigger

394
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,880
and i'm going to cd to the documents

395
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
folder because remember the documents

396
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,360
have all of the apps

397
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,600
insecure apps and so the apk folder

398
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
is

399
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,839
excuse me the apk tool

400
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,039
allows us to decompile the android app

401
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,919
to almost to its original form

402
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
and also what the apk tool does is

403
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,000
after we decompile and let's just say we

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,280
change the app it allows us to rebuild

405
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,240
the app with our changes and then we can

406
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,119
then

407
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,919
possibly upload those changes to a

408
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,799
third-party website so it allows us to

409
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,600
decompile to look under the hood of the

410
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,799
application and then rebuild the app if

411
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,240
we so if we make changes so that's cool

412
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
so i just typed the command that we will

413
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,880
use to

414
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,200
act to use the apk tool in this apk tool

415
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,720
d for decompile and then my covet

416
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
app.apk

417
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,120
and as you can see

418
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,880
it is

419
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,520
actually decompiling

420
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
and we see here

421
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,559
there's a android manifest that i will

422
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,640
talk about later

423
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
uh

424
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
box molly so there are

425
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,360
the decompile when you decompile an

426
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
android app there's three folders in the

427
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,039
file so the file is the android manifest

428
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,760
that xml and then the three folders are

429
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,280
meta m

430
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,720
res

431
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,960
and smallie so i will talk about those

432
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
shortly

433
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
now if we go back to the

434
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
documents

435
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,760
folder we now see this my covet folder

436
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,240
that we didn't see before and i'm not

437
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,880
going to open this folder

438
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,919
yet because i'm going to talk about the

439
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,080
content of this folder

440
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,640
with the next tool that i use

441
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
to

442
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,679
review the

443
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,200
covet app and that tool is jedx gui

444
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,799
and that is under reverse engineering

445
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,760
and so reverse engineering

446
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
allows us to

447
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
look under the hood

448
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
and inspect

449
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
uh and in this case an android app

450
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
and we're going to click the android app

451
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,400
to open it

452
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,120
to look um inspect

453
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
and look under the hood of an android

454
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,960
app also to make changes to it if we so

455
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,320
choose

456
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,360
so

457
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,919
we are essentially looking at the source

458
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
code of the android app

459
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
so this

460
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,840
app

461
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,679
here this um

462
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,200
that's running inside of the android x86

463
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,799
emulator

464
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,080
the code

465
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,799
equivalent is right here

466
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,039
pretty cool huh

467
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,240
so now i'm going to talk about the

468
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
three folders and the files that i

469
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
mentioned after using the apk tool

470
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,559
so the first

471
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,039
folder is the res folder and you could

472
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,440
think of the res folder as a catch-all

473
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,320
so anything that has to deal with

474
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,280
layouts of the android app fonts

475
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
animations

476
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,559
um

477
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,320
colors

478
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
things of that nature will be in the

479
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,000
rarest folder meta-imp the second folder

480
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,159
is you could think of that as the

481
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,120
integrity folder meaning

482
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,840
this folder has hashes

483
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,159
and to make sure that the file the

484
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,159
application has not been tampered with

485
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,120
next i'm going to talk about the file

486
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
which is the android manifest file

487
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,720
and this is the kudegra

488
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,120
of every android app because you need

489
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,559
this file

490
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,760
and why you may ask because this file

491
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,039
describes

492
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,039
everything that is needed for your

493
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,559
android app

494
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,200
examples are permissions

495
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,799
such as lines four through nine and for

496
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,200
this app the permissions are internet

497
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,360
bluetooth wake lock

498
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,679
receive boot completed and foreground

499
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
service

500
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,240
next it describes the different android

501
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,679
components

502
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,480
one such component is an activity and

503
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
you can think of an activity

504
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
and android as representing a screen

505
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,559
one screen in android in an android app

506
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,440
and

507
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
mind you

508
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,679
in an android app you can have multiple

509
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,120
activities but you will have one

510
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,640
main activity so the main activity

511
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,120
starts on line 11

512
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,400
and that is the exposure notification

513
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,960
activity and we can tell it's the main

514
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
activity because on line 13 we see

515
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,679
the

516
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,720
main here

517
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
next

518
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,200
and we see other activities online 17-23

519
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,559
next on line 26 we have a broadcast

520
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,400
receiver a broadcast receiver registers

521
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
events

522
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,120
or intents

523
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,039
and

524
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,760
events or intents represent things that

525
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,799
happens on the device for

526
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,320
an example

527
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,120
a sample event is when the battery's low

528
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,679
for my phone that is at 15

529
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,960
so the battery my phone

530
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,400
kicks off and says hey i'm at 15 percent

531
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
it lets the android operating system

532
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,240
know and says hey register this event of

533
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,159
my batteries low

534
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,200
register the event of low battery the

535
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,080
android operating system says yep i see

536
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,159
it i have it i'm going to register the

537
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,799
event and then it sends it back to the

538
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,280
device and what happens

539
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,080
i get a dialog box on my phone that says

540
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,960
low battery need to charge your battery

541
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200
or your phone is going to die in such

542
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,679
amount of time and then it's up to me to

543
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,520
charge my phone

544
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
so line 26

545
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,280
is an example of a broadcast receiver

546
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,840
and we have an exposure notification

547
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,240
broadcast receiver now lines 28 29 and

548
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
30 have specified at specific actions

549
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,919
and exposure state updated exposure not

550
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,799
found in exposure match now remember

551
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
during the example with mia and jacob

552
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,080
and it was like they were at the store

553
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
then jacob started to feel sick he took

554
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,440
a cobra test and then he was

555
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
unfortunately he had covered 19.

556
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
um at that point mia started looking at

557
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,000
the tokens from the last 14 days she

558
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,640
realized one of the tokens that was

559
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,679
jacob

560
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,400
she was you know in close proximity

561
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,039
to that person and they tested positive

562
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,960
for cover 19. so that would correspond

563
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,240
to this exposure match here because she

564
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,360
was exposed to someone that

565
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,400
had copied so that's what that broadcast

566
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,679
that action would signify

567
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,720
next

568
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
we have a service online 33 which is

569
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,960
another component in android

570
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,159
and there are three services in android

571
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,480
the first is a foreground service and

572
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
this is the service that a user can

573
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
interact with so an example is

574
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,240
downloading a file right you can pause

575
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
the downloads you could cancel the

576
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,039
download so you as a user can interact

577
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,279
with that on your mobile device

578
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,760
second service is a background service

579
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,840
that's a service the user cannot

580
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,960
interact with an example is syncing of

581
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,919
data so for instance i have gmail on my

582
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,039
phone and ev every so often

583
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,080
gmail will sync on my phone to make sure

584
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
it's up to date

585
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,760
i can't stop that sync it happens in the

586
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
background

587
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
and then the third type of service is a

588
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,840
bound service that happens based on

589
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,360
requests and responses and is active as

590
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,919
long as those requests and responses are

591
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,279
active

592
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,640
and line 33 represents the service and

593
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,919
that is the wake up service

594
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,760
and then finally

595
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,360
the last

596
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,679
component android component we have is a

597
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,320
provider a content provider

598
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
you could think of a content provider as

599
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,559
the middleman

600
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,919
and

601
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,240
the middleman between the app and the

602
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,320
back end

603
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,200
and the backend so for instance the app

604
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,320
is saying hey i want to read a file in

605
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
the database if so what happens is the

606
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
app would talk with the content provider

607
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,919
the content provider would then say hey

608
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,880
i want to read a file in this database

609
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,000
and then the app

610
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,080
the content provider excuse me the

611
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,440
database will say to the content

612
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,159
provider yeah you have permission okay

613
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,360
i'll i'll let you read read my file

614
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,919
here's the file you can read it and so

615
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,400
then the content provider will then

616
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,760
give the information back to the app

617
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,279
and that's how that works so as i said

618
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,480
the android manifest is the skeleton of

619
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,200
your android app and it describes in

620
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,480
great detail how your app should work

621
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
but there's one thing i need to mention

622
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,679
and that is between lines one and two so

623
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
i'm gonna call it 1.5

624
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
you see

625
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,039
this uses sdk

626
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,080
and it says android

627
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
min sdk version 23 and target sdk

628
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,840
version 29.

629
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,520
what does that mean

630
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,400
so

631
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,520
this

632
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,600
says okay

633
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,320
the minimum operating system android

634
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,480
operating system

635
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,360
this

636
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,039
it says okay for this app

637
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,360
here's the minimum operating system

638
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,120
android operating system that this

639
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
device will work on

640
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,880
but if you want optimal results

641
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,679
use the target operating system the

642
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
target or above

643
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,080
and so the operating systems are

644
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,960
represented by numbers but these numbers

645
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,520
are really mnemonics or the names of the

646
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,080
operating systems such as jelly bean

647
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
marshmallow oreo

648
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
you uh the different names of the

649
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,799
operating systems instead of saying the

650
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,960
names inside of the android manifest is

651
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,320
just represented by numbers

652
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
and finally

653
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
we need to talk about the last folder

654
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,159
which is smallie

655
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:58,960
but

656
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
i'm going

657
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,559
i'm going to talk about that now but

658
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,440
first

659
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,559
let's go

660
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,200
to the main activity remember every

661
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,720
android app has a one main activity and

662
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,559
that's the exposure

663
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,720
notification activity

664
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,840
and if we go there

665
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,399
we

666
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,799
are inside of the code

667
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,080
and this code is written in java

668
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,679
so this

669
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,360
is actually the code for the kobit app

670
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,320
and

671
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,120
if you look at the bottom we see this

672
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,880
second tab

673
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,480
that says molly so if we click on that

674
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
we see something that looks kind of like

675
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,080
java but it's not so

676
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,039
smally is the low level

677
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
you can think of it as assembly language

678
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,360
the low-level language of the android

679
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,480
app

680
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,520
so most times you will not be dealing at

681
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,679
the smallie level you you will be

682
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,080
dealing at the cold level

683
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,600
so this level

684
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,440
but i wanted to mention smallie because

685
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,919
if you reverse engineer an app or

686
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,200
decompile an app the somali folder will

687
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
be present and i don't want you to freak

688
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
out or

689
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,760
wonder hey what is this for

690
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,559
the smallie is just pretty much the low

691
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,120
level representation of your code

692
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,919
and as i said you would not really be

693
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,320
dealing on that level you would be

694
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,159
dealing on the code level and the

695
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,000
smallie is represented by a dot d e x or

696
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,200
dalvik executable and dalvik is the

697
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
dalvik virtual machine and that is what

698
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,039
the android operating system uses

699
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,760
so as i said i just wanted to

700
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,000
mention smallie because you will see it

701
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,080
but you really won't be interacting with

702
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,880
it much

703
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,399
now

704
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
the main event

705
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,640
okay we talked about the different

706
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
folders

707
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,559
the different tools we reverse

708
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,640
engineered the app we're looking at the

709
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,600
code

710
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,760
and it's like but what did you find

711
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
jasmine when you looked at this app

712
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
good question

713
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,399
so

714
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,918
what i found is

715
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,559
i found

716
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,880
i was able to reverse engineer reverse

717
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,520
engineer the app but again for android

718
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
apps that's pretty much a gimme because

719
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,960
that's very easy to do as i've shown

720
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,240
with inside this interactive example

721
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,760
i potentially was able to do cold

722
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
tampering and i'll and i say it

723
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,880
potentially

724
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,279
and i'll explain

725
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,080
why in a little bit and

726
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,480
extraneous functionality so let me

727
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,440
explain a little bit about the potential

728
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,519
of cold tampering

729
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,519
so as i said in the beginning of this

730
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,840
presentation during introductions

731
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
i created mobile challenges for the

732
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,159
biohacking village for this previous

733
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,919
defcon

734
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,480
and what i did i changed

735
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
one of the logging

736
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,519
to say saint elvis will never find this

737
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,840
and saint elvis is the fictitious

738
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
hospital and then i put the flag android

739
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,799
apps always have a main activity and

740
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,840
they do

741
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,960
now

742
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,200
while this example is you know trivial

743
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,080
and

744
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,399
it's kind of funny and things of that

745
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,360
nature

746
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,080
remember going back to the example of

747
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,679
mia and jacob

748
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,000
and the anonymous tokens

749
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,679
it it stated that their location and

750
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,240
their identity are not tied to their

751
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,519
tokens

752
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,320
but what happens if i change the app to

753
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,000
where the tokens do

754
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
um

755
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,240
the tokens do

756
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,720
remember you by location

757
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
and identity

758
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
if you are posi if you test positive for

759
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,799
coping 19.

760
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,960
and what happens if that if the

761
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,679
attacker takes it a step further and if

762
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,640
you do test positive for proven 19 they

763
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,279
dump that information to a log

764
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,000
so anyone who queries that log could

765
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
figure out

766
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,399
who has tested positive for proven 19

767
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,760
now

768
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,120
i'm not saying

769
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,279
to do that because ethically that would

770
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,559
be wrong again this app is used to make

771
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,640
sure people are safe we are in a

772
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,480
pandemic i'm doing

773
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,960
a disclaimer i'm not saying doing to do

774
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,000
that

775
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,799
but what i am saying is

776
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,240
it possibly could be done right

777
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,360
so

778
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,840
that's why i said

779
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,000
potential code tampering i'm not going

780
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,240
to do it because ethically it's not

781
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,120
right

782
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,000
but you could do it right

783
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,360
you could do it

784
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,799
now

785
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,399
going back to the code

786
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,080
and

787
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
use

788
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,279
for certain things like we can see

789
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,799
certain objects support fragment manager

790
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,519
2 but then other objects if they're

791
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,080
something c0676

792
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,519
and it's like hey what does that object

793
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,240
mean and why is it showing up that way

794
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,279
well

795
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,720
reverse engineering is a

796
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,880
double-edged sword

797
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,039
on one side of the sword for researchers

798
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,640
it's like

799
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,240
great you know

800
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,840
we can look at this app we can learn it

801
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,640
you know if there's vulnerabilities we

802
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,360
can do one you know responsible

803
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,760
vulnerability disclosure and make the

804
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,918
app better right you know because you

805
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,239
want to do the right thing

806
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,440
on the other side of the sword as a

807
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,639
company

808
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
as a owner

809
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,599
i don't

810
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
want you to look at my code because it's

811
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,800
proprietary it's secret

812
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,199
so what do i do well

813
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,159
i employ something called

814
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,800
obfuscation and that's the

815
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,960
tactic or

816
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,599
the means of doing security through

817
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,800
obscurity and this object c0676a

818
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,040
and

819
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,000
c3673r are examples of obfuscating

820
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,760
so the thought is if i make my code

821
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,399
in so obscure

822
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,359
you as the researcher will become so

823
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,880
frustrated that you would not want to

824
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
learn the inner workings of my

825
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,800
application

826
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,760
now

827
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,640
don't fret because there are commercial

828
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,599
tools that can be used to help you

829
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,160
and de-obfuscating meaning turning the

830
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,119
obscure code to a more

831
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,359
intelligible

832
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,720
um

833
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,000
meaning

834
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,839
and i will talk about those in a little

835
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,119
bit but

836
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,400
um

837
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,560
that is the meaning of obfuscation and

838
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,720
companies do is thinking

839
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,960
i appreciated my code

840
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,359
you will not find my secrets and it's

841
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,480
like but

842
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,079
i can and i will i'm obfuscating is just

843
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,079
it might slow a person down but it

844
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,320
doesn't deter them

845
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,520
so

846
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,119
gen x gooey

847
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,760
does his best to de-opsy-skate so it

848
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,640
does its best to try to make the code as

849
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,119
clear as possible and we can see that

850
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,160
because it's checked so if we uncheck

851
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,000
this the opposition

852
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
and then we look at the source code

853
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
again

854
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
now we see

855
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,599
aaa

856
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,480
c

857
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,000
d a a a e

858
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,079
again this is

859
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,839
a

860
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,640
you know to reverse engineer to find the

861
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,640
logic of this would be very difficult

862
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,920
so

863
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,079
a way to aid that is to de-obfuscate or

864
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,000
to find

865
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,079
a clear meaning of the code

866
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,320
and i want to mention that concept

867
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,560
because if you do reverse engineer an

868
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,599
app

869
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,880
any app android or apple

870
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,000
is

871
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,079
it will be obfuscated

872
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,599
and it will you will have to de-obscate

873
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,599
to try to find

874
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,640
you know

875
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
the meaning of the app and

876
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
the logic

877
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,680
now

878
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,920
i mentioned the

879
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,720
um vulnerability will the two and then

880
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,200
the possible the reverse engineering

881
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,520
potentially cold tampering and

882
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,240
extraneous functionality that i found

883
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,880
when i was reviewing the app but

884
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,000
where did that come from like how did i

885
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,119
find

886
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,480
those potential vulnerabilities well

887
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,680
there is something called the olaf

888
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,640
mobile top 10. a lot of people know of

889
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,000
the oauth top 10 for web

890
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,240
sql injection

891
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,480
broken access control

892
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,599
um insufficient logging things of that

893
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,520
nature but there is a mobile top 10

894
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,640
and i am going to explain a little bit

895
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,359
of that in relation to what i found

896
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,240
inside of the app so let's get back to

897
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,960
the presentation okay the oauth

898
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
mobile top 10.

899
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,839
so

900
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,839
cold tampering

901
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,160
this is a catch-all and it means

902
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
it contains tampered versions of a

903
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,920
mobile app

904
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,000
so for instance when i mentioned the

905
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,119
example of mia and jacob where the

906
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,839
anonymous tokens does not record

907
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,839
location or the person's identity and i

908
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,520
was saying but what happens if i change

909
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,520
to where the tokens do

910
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,320
remember location and the person's

911
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,000
identity if they are positive

912
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,079
and dumps it to a log

913
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,040
that is an example of code tampering

914
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,240
because

915
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,560
the code originally did not do that and

916
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,359
then i tampered or changed it

917
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,359
for it to be so

918
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,839
so what would happen is i would change

919
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,119
um not i but that would be changed then

920
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,520
you will resign the app and then you

921
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,320
will push it to a third-party app now

922
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,200
disclaimer i'm not saying to do this

923
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
especially for this app

924
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,160
due to the nature of what this app is

925
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,119
used for to keep people safe during a

926
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,040
pandemic so

927
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,760
this is an example i'm not saying for

928
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,280
this to be done

929
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,839
so let me make that disclaimer

930
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:34,880
now

931
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,680
what are ways to remediate against

932
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,599
against cold tampering

933
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,359
well

934
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,119
one way is to identify have the app

935
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,160
identify any code integrity violation

936
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,200
and react suitably to it every time so

937
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,359
what does that mean

938
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,640
meaning when the app runs if there is

939
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,760
dangerous code the app should not run

940
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,320
it's excuse me the app should not run

941
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,079
that code meaning it should move that

942
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,800
code to a sandbox and it should not run

943
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,079
it

944
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,720
another

945
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,880
another technique is to have

946
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,000
anti-tank anti-tamper techniques

947
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,720
where you can have checksums digital

948
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,680
signatures cold hard hardening

949
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,079
and other validation methods so for

950
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,119
instance

951
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,960
let's just say

952
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,599
my app

953
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,280
has a checksum

954
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,520
of

955
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,240
abc123

956
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,079
and

957
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,760
i download

958
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,640
the app and my checksum is def jkl

959
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,880
well i know whatever i downloaded is not

960
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,160
the correct version of the app because

961
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,119
the checksums don't match so

962
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,160
again

963
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,440
this is good to make sure if someone is

964
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,760
using the app they're using the correct

965
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,079
version because it's an easy way for

966
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,400
someone to validate right and that's

967
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,960
what you want you want the user the end

968
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,359
user or the consumer to be able to

969
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,280
validate quickly

970
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,480
okay and have confidence okay i'm using

971
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,079
the correct version

972
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,400
reverse engineering and as i said this

973
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,800
was pretty much a gimme

974
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,839
decompiled to perform code analysis and

975
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,319
it's allowed to look under the hood

976
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,440
understand inspect and modify the code

977
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,240
to include harmful functionality or

978
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,079
transmit undesired advertisements so an

979
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,720
example of this is download instagram

980
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,040
from the google play store and reverse

981
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,200
engineer the app using jdx gui right

982
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,359
so what is the remediation

983
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,839
not allow the app to de-obfuscate the

984
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,520
code using tools like ida pro hopper or

985
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,440
proguard

986
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,880
so

987
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,640
these are the commercial tools that i

988
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,920
was telling you about ida pro hopper or

989
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,680
pro art so

990
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,839
as i said gen x gui tries his best to

991
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,960
de-occuscape the code as much as as much

992
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,400
as it can

993
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,920
but these

994
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,160
commercial tools will take it a step

995
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,040
further now you won't get 100 coverage

996
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,720
meaning everything will not be

997
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,839
de-obfuscated right but

998
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,000
using these commercial tools would give

999
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,839
you a good subset of

1000
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:35,520
de-obfuscation to where you would have a

1001
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,200
good baseline

1002
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,359
to

1003
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,200
know the lay of the land of the app

1004
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,160
and it's actually when looking at this

1005
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,440
remediation of not allowing the app

1006
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,839
to de-obfuscate the code

1007
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,240
i kind of shake my head because or

1008
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,720
scratch my head rather because it's like

1009
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,960
i don't understand how

1010
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,000
you can

1011
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,119
actually have the app not use these

1012
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,160
tools

1013
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,280
so

1014
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,839
this remediation is

1015
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,040
it's yeah it it's kind of a cop-out

1016
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,839
and extraneous functionality so this is

1017
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,640
where

1018
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,520
developers leave backdoors or additional

1019
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,920
functionality in mobile apps not meant

1020
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
for the end user this can be

1021
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,920
configuration files or debug pages so

1022
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,880
in a very very very formal life i was a

1023
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,920
developer and i remember

1024
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,599
my dev team we would create web pages

1025
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,400
and we would have debug pages

1026
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,920
for when the web page didn't work we can

1027
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,400
go to the debug page and figure out what

1028
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,640
part of the web page didn't work instead

1029
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,440
of looking at the entire webpage

1030
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,560
and this is cool and this is great when

1031
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,680
you're actually developing the app and

1032
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,760
you know in the perfect world when

1033
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,319
you're done developing you delete the

1034
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,560
debug page and then you

1035
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,359
ship the product to production or you

1036
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,040
ship it live

1037
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,720
well what happens is a lot of times is

1038
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
these debug pages

1039
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,079
stay in the cold base and when the

1040
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,920
product goes by

1041
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,359
these cold

1042
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,119
these debug pages or configuration files

1043
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
that should be deleted go live right

1044
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,440
along with it

1045
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,720
now

1046
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,359
what's the way to remediate examine the

1047
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,000
mobile apps configuration settings to

1048
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,640
detect any hidden switches and if you

1049
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,920
have debug pages delete them right

1050
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,960
because depending on how verbose or

1051
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,760
descriptive these configuration settings

1052
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,960
or debug pages are it can give an

1053
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,720
attacker a very good way to

1054
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,078
attack your application

1055
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,359
now the last part of this presentation

1056
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,960
continue learning

1057
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,359
as i said inside the intro to android

1058
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,760
security virtual machine i have

1059
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,560
additional apps the mobile security

1060
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,839
testing guide hacking playground

1061
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,280
is one such app diva ig learner and

1062
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,760
uncrackable series and it's inside the

1063
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,240
documents folder as i stated

1064
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,000
and to actually use these apps

1065
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,359
you will push them to an emulator such

1066
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,200
as android x86 or to a device

1067
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,160
using the android debug bridge

1068
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,640
and now this is outside the scope of

1069
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,760
this presentation but i do have a

1070
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,800
youtube video on my youtube channel on

1071
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,200
how to do this how to push apps to an

1072
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,720
emulator or to a device so check out my

1073
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,520
youtube channel thefluffy007

1074
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,640
as well if you want to learn more

1075
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,520
and finally additional learning

1076
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,800
if you want to look at videos

1077
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,960
on mobile security you can look at

1078
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,680
hacker one they have a mobile security

1079
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,000
playlist which is free that's what the f

1080
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,359
stands for

1081
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,359
if you want to do additional challenges

1082
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,480
besides the insecure apps that i have

1083
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,240
mobisec has a have free challenges and

1084
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,319
then pentester lab has paid challenges

1085
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,240
um on their website and they include new

1086
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
