00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,720
hello and welcome to a presentation

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,680
about the aerospace village badge design

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
my name is dan allen and i have the

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,639
twitch handle at cyber test pilot

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
how to pcb i am completely self-taught

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,880
i

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
wanted to get into pcb design and i

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,400
found the youtube series uh by sean

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,920
himmel

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
sponsored by digikey it's a 10 part

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,599
keycad

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,279
video series and it walks you through a

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,719
very logical

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,760
progression from zero to hero

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
how to pcb from start to finish

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,680
where you can actually get something

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,600
fabricated and hold it in your hand that

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,360
you have designed i found that video

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,760
series fantastically helpful

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
and from there just launched my

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
inquisitive

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,079
mind to continue learning and see what i

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,000
can do in the space

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
along those lines

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
the free open source software tools that

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,000
i found and utilized throughout this

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
project

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
inkscape as a svg

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,159
editor for all the graphics

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,680
uh keycad the pcb manufacturing you know

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,840
software

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,720
files

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,439
i found a module svg2 mod this is very

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,200
helpful module to take the vector

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
graphic

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,960
files that inkscape would make and then

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
convert them to the keycad

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,040
module footprints that would then be

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,560
necessary so it's kind of like go

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
between inkscape and keycad where you

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,360
can join art and

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,200
engineering kind of at the same time

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
it's a command line script

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
and does the conversion for you

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,079
i use the arduino ide i stuck with the

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
micro controller the attiny 85 it was a

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
stock i was familiar with

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
in terms of purchase tools to actually

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
program my controller

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,960
and the sparkfun avr tiny programmer

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
retails for sixteen dollars

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,399
and then the icsp pogo adapter retails

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,159
for 12 dollars little kit you can get

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,759
from sparkfun

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
the two hardware components utilize to

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
actually program the micro controller

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,239
so we started at the aerospace village

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,480
from just an initial concept a top-down

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
view of an aircraft

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,959
you can see that we had initially uh the

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,680
designs for an adsb dipole antenna

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,440
coming out the wings we knew we wanted

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,920
an integral antenna that was tuned to

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,800
the 1090 megahertz frequency to be used

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
as a receiving device for

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,519
adsb messages

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
and then we had this kind of an

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
additional idea to have additional wire

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
leads being able to come out that can be

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
cut tuned to different frequencies

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,480
lengths to adjust for the frequencies

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
and so that we can have a mechanism to

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,120
have additional connections at that

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,319
point

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,200
so

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,440
from this initial concept design we have

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
to actually turn this into some

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
engineering and make some trade spaces

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
and concessions to actually get into

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
something that we can actually

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
manufacture

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
so the initial concept morphed into this

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
two engine top-down view of a 787

84
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,879
aircraft a boeing 787

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,720
you can see here that the dipole

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,959
antennas have been moved to be more

87
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
aligned with fuselage this is just a

88
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
practical length

89
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,760
extension where we can get that

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
perpendicular

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
or parallel rather dipole antenna setup

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
as it ran the entire length of the

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
fuselage

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
and then from a top-down view like let's

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
make it fun and aesthetically pleasing

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
let's add the anti-collision lights and

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
some navigation lights as well as some

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,159
flight deck lighting uh and then we use

99
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,239
the engines as an opportunity for the

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
sma connectors this is really fun

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,200
because

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
dimensionally it could kind of work out

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,000
where we scale the engine back from the

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
actual drawing and then kind of use the

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
additional space of the sma connector to

106
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,640
kind of protrude forward as the engine

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,879
cowling that was kind of a fun way to

108
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
play

109
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
the actual characteristic shapes of an

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,599
aircraft with actual components

111
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,439
that we're going to need to make the

112
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,720
badge functional

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
so this idea needs to get mapped to a

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
schematic

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
so here in this box here we've got the

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,440
uh a t tiny 85 it's pretty

117
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,320
uh

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
small form factor and also relatively

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
inexpensive microcontroller

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
and had this efficient amount of pin

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
outs that we needed for this project

122
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
down here in the lower left corner we've

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
got a switch

124
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,479
and connection to a battery so that we

125
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,600
can turn power on and off to the device

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
uh we've got a breakout here for i2c and

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
then ground and power so that we can

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,759
interact with the microcontroller

129
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,000
external

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
or easier

131
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
and then we've got the icsp connection

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
here so it's easy to program the

133
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,199
microcontroller

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
and then the two sma connectors here and

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,720
here so engine

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,639
on the left engine on the right

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,000
and then the remaining components are

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,199
simply the resistors and reverse mount

139
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,400
leds

140
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,479
that we use to achieve the lighting

141
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,479
effects

142
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,320
as we move on we need to make the parts

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,479
fit this is kind of an interesting trade

144
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,440
space

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,800
in my limited experience designing pcbs

146
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
you've got an idea of what you want

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,840
things to do and how you want them to

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,960
operate

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,560
but you have a form factor that's

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
limiting and you need to

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,440
make sure all the components fit

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,160
and

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
can be compatible with one another

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,479
real quickly

155
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,800
as we make the parts fit and this is

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
something that i learned in the design

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
process

158
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
it's good to have an understanding of

159
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,919
how you want to take the graphic uh but

160
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
eventually it has to be moved to the

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,440
keycad

162
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,560
footprint module and so knowing the

163
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
processes and steps that you have to go

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,720
through to get to the end state it is

165
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,919
helpful to take just a quick second and

166
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,440
walk through

167
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
the tool that we use to make that uh

168
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,639
inkscape to key cat format and that is

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
the svg

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,960
ii

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
mod

172
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,319
so if we go here this module that i

173
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,800
found online exactly as it states

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,520
converts inkscape svg drawings to kicad

175
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
keycap footprint

176
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,039
module files

177
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
command line tool

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,960
give it the input svg that we will

179
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
design in inkscape

180
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,639
and then export as we need to

181
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,120
i draw your attention to this because of

182
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
the layering

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,919
what they're talking about here what

184
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,680
svg2 mod is looking for is a specific

185
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
set of named layers in the inkscape file

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,560
this is helpful so that we can start to

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
organize

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
how we want the

189
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
inkscape files

190
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,639
to

191
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
uh be organized

192
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
so as we make the parts fit we'll jump

193
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
over to the inkscape file itself

194
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,120
these named layers are matching uh what

195
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,240
we want the svg to mod

196
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
we'll be able to pick up those named

197
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
layers and then export them to the

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
correct keycad

199
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
module footprint so

200
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,039
in pcb land thinking in layers

201
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
there's essentially four

202
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
color opportunities that you get to pick

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,080
from

204
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,039
there's the color of the copper layer

205
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,400
silver

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
typically

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,639
in color

208
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,479
there's the

209
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,120
solder paste color that you get to pick

210
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
most often that's green but depending on

211
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
the manufacturers that you go with you

212
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
can make it blue blue was the chosen

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,319
color for the final

214
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,440
version of the badge um in addition to

215
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,960
that on top of the

216
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,120
solder paste color you get typically

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,879
either a color white or black that's

218
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,479
called the silk screen

219
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
layer we got white

220
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,800
with this particular manufacturer

221
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
and then the other kind of fourth

222
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,840
uh perhaps neglected color is actually

223
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
the substrate color so if you could see

224
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
through the board it's the color that is

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
in the middle

226
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
uh so it's kind of a translucent almost

227
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,120
yellowish color but there's

228
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
opportunities to use that as a fourth

229
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
color

230
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
thinking in terms of layers

231
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
now we have an opportunity to outline

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
that in inkscape

233
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
and with svg2 mod in place or with an

234
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
understanding of how it works the first

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,479
layer we have selected here is the edge

236
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,000
cuts

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
i'm going to turn on the front copper

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,760
layer

239
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
here you'll see that

240
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,958
this is our

241
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,640
dipole antenna if you can see the value

242
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,360
up here it's

243
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,959
65.173 millimeters in length

244
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
and there's an equal one on this side as

245
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
well and that is to

246
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
be tuned specifically to the adsb

247
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,080
frequency of 1090 megahertz

248
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
interestingly enough the

249
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,600
um

250
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,680
length overall length of the badge was

251
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
more or less dictated by the length of

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
this dipole antenna

253
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
we squeezed as much as we could right

254
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
there

255
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
and equally similarly at the top so this

256
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
is a design consideration constraint

257
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
this is one of our bounding dimensions

258
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,880
is to make sure that we have sufficient

259
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,240
length for the antenna

260
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
for the navigation lights uh i found

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
through experience that using a copper

262
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,399
pore indicated by the entirety of the

263
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,279
black really kind of help to highlight

264
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
or isolate the light that we want to

265
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
shine through from the reverse mount led

266
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
it was kind of a nice little aesthetic

267
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
trick

268
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
you'll notice this black box here

269
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
and that is when it's combined with the

270
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,040
mask you'll see as i toggle them

271
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
the aerospace village logo

272
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,680
indicating that with the mask here

273
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
we would get no

274
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
uh

275
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,560
because um copper would not be copper

276
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
will be poured there but solder screen

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,760
mask

278
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
would copper will be poured in the

279
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
entirety of the black circle

280
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
but then solder screen mask the blue

281
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
will be absent where the black is here

282
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,839
now so we get the logo to shine through

283
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,600
in the same color as our copper pore

284
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,480
which was silver and then

285
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
draw your attention to

286
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,959
the flight deck lighting so the mask

287
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
this would go through to the substrate

288
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,360
and then because we also in the copper

289
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
pore here's the copper where black is

290
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,240
copper will be

291
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
and where the mask is solder paste will

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
not be this is kind of an idiom to get

293
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,279
used to

294
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,519
uh and it's even confusing as i vocalize

295
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,160
it

296
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,279
um

297
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,240
copper layer is where material will go

298
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
and then in the mask layer its wool

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,800
material will be um absent

300
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
when you put those together you're

301
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
actually going to get a um

302
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
a through layer all the way which is

303
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
exactly what we want because we want to

304
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,279
reverse

305
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,000
uh mount reverse light this flight deck

306
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
lighting and then also

307
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,440
the navigation lights

308
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,959
that are present on both edges of the

309
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,279
wing

310
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,360
the last decorative layer and this is a

311
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
little more straightforward to think

312
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,720
through is the silk screen

313
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,200
so this is just exactly where you want

314
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
the color white

315
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
to be printed

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,880
is where it will go and so in this

317
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,279
instance we've got silk screen

318
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
really helping us outline and sell the

319
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
shape of leading edge flaps trailing

320
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
edge flaps vertical stabilizer

321
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,120
horizontal stabilizer

322
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,959
over wing doors

323
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,760
just

324
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,480
exterior doors and so this

325
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
layer

326
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
is the silk screen

327
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,920
this svg2 i'm sorry this inkscape is

328
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,880
saved as an svg file and then run

329
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,399
through the svg2 mod

330
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,880
converter and at this point now we have

331
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
a keycad

332
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,200
file format that can be used and

333
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
imported into

334
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
the

335
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,319
next set of steps

336
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
prior to

337
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
moving things into to

338
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
kicad

339
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,399
uh i did want to kind of do an

340
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,760
operational

341
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,560
check verification that sizing of

342
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
components would still work for me it

343
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,800
was easier to print on a one-to-one

344
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
ratio and then just draw in with pencil

345
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,639
this is a

346
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
rough draft drawing of an idea that i

347
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,040
had as we're getting closer to the

348
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,839
progressive you know final stage

349
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,240
form factor i wanted to really make sure

350
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
that the sma connectors as roughly

351
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,560
measured would aesthetically look

352
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,079
correct

353
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,279
in terms of

354
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,959
replacement of the engine cowlings i

355
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,800
wanted to make sure that the battery

356
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,560
could be sufficiently hidden with the

357
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
retainer clip that hence the battery

358
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,920
in the middle of the graphic

359
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,519
my small representation of where the

360
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,639
microcontroller approximately will go

361
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
and then just kind of holding up some of

362
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
the reverse mount leds that i had chosen

363
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
like will these work out on that edge of

364
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
the wingtip

365
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
again one of the constraints was the

366
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
length of the overall uh adsb internal

367
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
antenna

368
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
once that was set to the minimum that it

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
could possibly be do i have sufficient

370
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,839
space to still sell the idea of

371
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,440
navigation lights here and then

372
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,920
anti-collision lights

373
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,560
here with sufficient space for battery

374
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
and power switch

375
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,519
so

376
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
this was a helpful step to make sure

377
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
that

378
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
conceptually physically the parts were

379
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,440
going to be compatible

380
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
with that work done we're ready to start

381
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,760
going into the

382
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,399
kycad

383
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
viewer

384
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,480
and

385
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,440
here

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
we've got the kicad program running i've

387
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,279
got just the edge cuts selected here as

388
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,360
our rough shape outline

389
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
we can turn on the front copper so you

390
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,120
recall from the inkscape

391
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,279
some of this will look very familiar

392
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,880
what we have now is additional wire

393
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,760
traces to connect the dipole antennas

394
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
uh footprints for the sma connectors

395
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,279
and

396
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,360
we can continue adding layers we can see

397
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
the back copper layer

398
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,959
at the grounding

399
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,320
for the

400
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
coin cell battery

401
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,160
we can start to get some of the

402
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,959
there in the back copper layer the green

403
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,680
we've got our no fill zone so our

404
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,920
reverse mount led is going to shine

405
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,720
through just that window

406
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
so to give us the kind of a clear focus

407
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
concise

408
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,120
version of what an anti-collision or a

409
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
navigation light rather would look like

410
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
out on the end

411
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,639
similar on the other wing and then we've

412
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,760
got

413
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,959
through hole leds these are white

414
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,199
leds for the strobe lights

415
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
and then we've got a similar kind of

416
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,680
layout reverse mount on the back copper

417
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
pore a light for the flight deck

418
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,639
lighting

419
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,000
with an understanding that the light

420
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,079
will as it's diffused will kind of

421
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,360
really go out and cover the entirety of

422
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,759
this window outlined by the front copper

423
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,120
pore

424
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
all of these things are working together

425
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,680
for us add to that the silk screen

426
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
layer

427
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
the back silk screen layer

428
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
and we are starting to get a badge that

429
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,839
has all of the components

430
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,920
lined up and we are getting very very

431
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
close to

432
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
fabrication

433
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
something i like in the keycad

434
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,839
viewer and i found this very helpful

435
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,199
is the

436
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,279
badge 3d viewer

437
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,519
or it's just the 3d viewer but in our

438
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,160
case this is the badge now and so

439
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,920
this was helpful to view

440
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,959
uh

441
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,199
set the blue color so i can see the

442
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,959
final form factor you can start to see

443
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,839
that the

444
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,320
silver is coming through for the bad

445
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,680
aerospace logo village

446
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,399
we've got our hole cut out here for the

447
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,440
anti-collision light we rotate this

448
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
all the components are fitting

449
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
we've got reverse

450
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
mount leds

451
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,920
uh the microcontroller with the

452
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
isp breakout for programming we've got

453
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
the switch

454
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
and

455
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
everything is

456
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,519
nearing completion at this point

457
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,720
so we have the kycad layers

458
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,000
we uh

459
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,280
bundle up the files uh from kican

460
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
they're called the gerber files you

461
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
bundle up the zip files you send them

462
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,959
off to the manufacturer

463
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
uh you wait number days weeks and then

464
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,520
you get your first version back

465
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
always a nail biter to see if it

466
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
actually works the first time

467
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,599
in this case pleasantly surprised

468
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,559
version one worked

469
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,400
it was incomplete

470
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
in that it didn't have initially like a

471
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
battery switch it or

472
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
the

473
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
external antenna connectors and this was

474
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,000
just kind of in the interest of a

475
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,360
compressed

476
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,559
timeline to make everything work uh some

477
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,160
of those initial considerations have

478
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,559
just been like foregone like let's get

479
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,919
something working this did have the

480
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,520
internal antenna

481
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
i did connect it

482
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,240
uh wire it up everything worked there

483
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,679
were no

484
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,960
shorts

485
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,000
um

486
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,559
but now in the redesigned version too

487
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,080
we've switched to the blue color the

488
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
final form factor we've added the

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,080
terminal connectors for the external

490
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,760
wires

491
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,880
here

492
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,679
if you can see these these are spring

493
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,679
loaded so that you can load a wire up

494
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,440
onto either side

495
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
and then it's wired now to one of the

496
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,400
sma

497
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
connectors

498
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,720
on the back

499
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,520
uh

500
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,919
showing it's got the switch

501
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,880
uh

502
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
and another

503
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,400
the design consideration i wanted

504
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,679
everything to be

505
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,880
to the extent possible surface mount to

506
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,559
keep kind of all the business end on the

507
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,360
back end of the badge or the battery

508
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,720
um

509
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
and all the other components are the one

510
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
concession i made and this was

511
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,679
intentional was the through hole uh

512
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,320
components for the spring loaded antenna

513
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,840
connectors and that was just to provide

514
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
a mechanical

515
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,640
uh advantage so that these things can

516
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
are fairly rigid i was concerned that

517
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,240
with the surface mount component if

518
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
something got tugged on it the whole

519
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
component could come off

520
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
through hole kind of solidified that so

521
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
it's still on the

522
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
on the back side of the badge it's still

523
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,039
fairly concise

524
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,160
and then the front of course the top is

525
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,480
a clean badge the only exception is like

526
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,200
the connections or the sma

527
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,600
as they're a side mount component they

528
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,039
have a mechanical top and bottom part

529
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,320
which is fine

530
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
in case there's any again mechanical

531
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,720
tugging on there

532
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,559
so prototype version two

533
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
we had it wired it up hooked it up to an

534
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
rtl sdr

535
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,360
dongle

536
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,400
uh ran the dump 1090 and

537
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,120
lo and behold adsb and traffic in my

538
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,960
local area was being captured and picked

539
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
up i was like this is amazing this is

540
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,799
really fun again for a first time

541
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,200
badge manufacturing process uh new to

542
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
the industry new to the concept of even

543
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,919
doing it myself like something i had

544
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,559
designed was working to

545
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,720
effectively pick up aircraft it was the

546
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,760
antenna

547
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
but it was also aesthetically an

548
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,679
airplane so it's kind of iconic in that

549
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,880
sense

550
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,480
and that was a lot of fun and very

551
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
rewarding

552
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
it's working so we've got the navigation

553
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,520
lights on

554
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
the strobe lights are pulsing that was

555
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,840
fun to program kind of just from my

556
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
experience watching aircraft at night

557
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,840
the

558
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,919
approximate uh pulse cycle of how ni

559
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,280
collision lights work

560
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,080
so that was a fun little event to

561
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,799
code up on the microcontroller

562
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,120
and then the really super cool version

563
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
is at night where you really get the

564
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,600
highlight of the navigation lights and

565
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
then of course you really get the the

566
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,679
selling of the anti-collision lights

567
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,720
so

568
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
questions if you are at all interested

569
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
in making this for yourself the entire

570
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,480
thing has been

571
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,490
posted to my av badge 2020 github repo

572
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,679
[Music]

573
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,360
in here

574
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,399
we can

575
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
see the entirety uh all the components

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
all uh everything that i've gone through

577
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,799
is stored in this repo

578
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,679
so the pictures that you've just seen

579
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,000
kit assembly instructions programming

580
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,840
with the

581
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,400
arduino we even had a contributor add a

582
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,120
lanyard modification so you can

583
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,360
wear the badge easy enough with a chain

584
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,480
or a rope of some sort

585
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
all the files are here if you want to

586
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
modify it

587
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,720
make recommendations

588
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,200
pull requests certainly

589
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
advised requested please do so if you

590
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,840
want to make this better

591
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
in terms of

592
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,400
kycad if you're interested in making

593
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,679
this if you don't want to go through the

594
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,159
whole hassle of

595
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,000
redesigning everything yourself you are

596
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
more than welcome to grab this aerospace

597
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,919
badge version 2

598
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
dot zip if you take this zip file and

599
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,200
send it to the

600
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,240
pcb manufacturer of your choice

601
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,679
they will be happy to manufacture a pcb

602
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,000
just exactly as we've walked through

603
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,600
and then in terms of the parts list

604
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
we've got the entirety

605
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,840
of the uh

606
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
this is the uh

607
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,080
parts all the parts the csv

608
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,799
and then the bom

609
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,000
um

610
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
that may not load that's the xls so

611
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,320
github's not going to show me that but

612
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,000
you can download that

613
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
we made all the purchases from

614
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,760
digikey so all the part numbers and

615
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
links are referenced relative to ggk

616
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
great resource to

617
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,080
get all of the obscure individual

618
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,120
components for the

619
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,480
badge

620
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
and

621
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
uh approximate digikey purchase price

622
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
for all the bombs about 13 and then

623
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
again depending on your pcb manufacturer

624
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,000
you probably get five badges just pcb

625
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
probably delivered your door for

626
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
anywhere in the ballpark of like 10 to

627
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,159
15 dollars at the low end it might take

628
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,840
a month to get but

629
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,280
it's available

630
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,159
but

631
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,280
that is a walkthrough of the aerospace

632
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
village badge

633
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
presented at defcon

634
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
safe mode

635
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
thanks

636
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,559
so that's it

637
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
well thank you for

638
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,520
for being here uh the talk was amazing

639
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,720
um

640
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,559
we have a lot of of of different

641
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,360
projects here in the airspace and we

642
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,080
really love to see how the batch of

643
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,679
of the bilat was done so amazing

644
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,000
we are now in the q a

645
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,279
we have uh in the right

646
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,000
the the the questions of the people that

647
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,279
is watching the talk so in case we have

648
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,760
anything here

649
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,760
we can read it and just answer it

650
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,279
okay thank you very much

651
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,400
okay done

652
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,920
um

653
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,240
[Music]

654
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,559
i will have a question for you

655
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,640
how much time uh

656
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
you've been designing the pcb

657
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,799
batch

658
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,880
that's a great question so i consider

659
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
myself like i'm still learning uh i feel

660
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,960
like if i

661
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
with years of experience i could

662
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
probably

663
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,799
do that

664
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,440
uh same badge like recreate it probably

665
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,400
in like a 15 to 20 hour you know kind of

666
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
timeline but given that i was still

667
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,360
learning how to do it like exploring and

668
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,840
iterating through it probably that badge

669
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,559
took every bit of like 80 hours like

670
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,640
when you add up you know hand drawings

671
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,600
to

672
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
what is the microcontroller i'm going to

673
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,159
pick

674
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,640
uh to like coding it up

675
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
it gets pretty involved it ends up being

676
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,360
spread out over multiple weeks

677
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,000
wow great and how much iterations do you

678
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,799
have in the pcb i mean how how many

679
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,799
times you send it to

680
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,919
to

681
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,039
to make

682
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,200
to make the pcb and

683
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
need to making a game

684
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,000
yeah so i like again from trial and

685
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,559
error um the that badge was i think the

686
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,960
fifth pcb that like i had ever done

687
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
myself so like

688
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,360
in previous iterations it was just me

689
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
tinkering with the whole idea of

690
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,799
manufacturing and design of a pcb

691
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,559
when the aerospace village needed a

692
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
volunteer to make a badge like all right

693
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
let's i've got a skill set let's bring

694
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,279
it and help out um

695
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,919
that said i we were under a time crunch

696
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,760
so i knew that i couldn't have a whole

697
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
lot of iterations with the manufacturer

698
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,840
because it takes about uh the

699
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
manufacturer i was using about 10 days

700
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,720
to come back from manufacturing to mail

701
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,159
back to my house

702
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,039
so

703
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,080
um

704
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
i did like a whole bunch of work to make

705
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,720
sure

706
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,039
version one was good

707
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
um and then sent off version two as a

708
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,559
low batch but i was expecting and hoping

709
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,720
you know fingers crossed that version 2

710
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,919
was going to work

711
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,360
it did um and so then we took like i

712
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
think i ordered 10

713
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
for version 2 and then we went up to

714
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,080
full volume

715
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
for the order

716
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,600
once and as soon as i i was watching the

717
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,360
mail so as soon as the board got there

718
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,120
it was like my afternoon i had to do

719
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,200
this thing right now to make sure it

720
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,840
works so that in like an hour i can you

721
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,279
know commit the order to the bigger

722
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,200
number oh that's great

723
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,159
um i think that that we don't have so

724
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,880
much question now but i have one more i

725
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200
think that with this question we can end

726
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
um so we have time to

727
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,960
to have the following talk um dan uh you

728
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
explained a little bit in in your talk

729
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,559
about how this idea uh grow up in in the

730
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,600
village um it was like a necessity it

731
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,559
was something like a challenge and how

732
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,880
it started this project

733
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,200
yeah so the aerospace village i think

734
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,799
you know had started initially at the

735
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,480
defcon conference

736
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,799
uh and the defcon conference has a big

737
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,120
badge life you know following

738
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,679
and so the aerospace village uh

739
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
initially was just the aviation village

740
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,520
and then as it relaunched you know for

741
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,919
year two it was the aerospace village

742
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,360
and it was getting bigger and it was uh

743
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,679
getting more name recognition more

744
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,399
branding like hey from the volunteer

745
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,240
corps like we should have a badge like

746
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,840
like all the other villages like we

747
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
should have a badge

748
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
and uh i was hungry i was like yeah like

749
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
this is like a good volunteer thing that

750
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,679
i can you know go sink myself my teeth

751
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,799
into

752
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,440
and uh help help the village out and i

753
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,520
kept asking like hey guys like i want to

754

um but not necessarily like

758
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,559
the capacity or capability for people to
