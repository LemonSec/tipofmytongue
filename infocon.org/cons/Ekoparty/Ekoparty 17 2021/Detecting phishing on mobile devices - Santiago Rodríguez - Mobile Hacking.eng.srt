00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,960
hello

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
welcome to everyone good morning good

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,160
afternoon

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,240
my name is santiago rodriguez

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
and this talk we will be presenting

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,239
fishing

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,920
according to fbi

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,160
during the last year there has been an

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,519
increase on 69 on phishing reports by

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,000
users or by companies

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,519
this means

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,238
a 4.1 billion dollars losses

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,520
and we don't

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
have these same numbers on argentina or

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
the same statistics to compare

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,160
but

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,239
some reports by telam

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,520
show us

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
some some numbers

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
i will be sharing with you the

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,559
links in

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,919
at the last of this presentation

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,039
so phishing is a really common

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
attack

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,840
just by checking at your spam folder on

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,799
the email you can see every day

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,840
tons of emails

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
trying to trick the user

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
so it's well um

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,200
this topic is quite

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,159
well managed by our

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,360
email

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,000
providers

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
but this topic is not

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
so well covered

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
on our mobile devices

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,119
so this is the main focus of this

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
presentation

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,799
how fishing

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
is getting more complex

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
and how phishing is trending to mobile

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
devices

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,040
i'm a security researcher working on a

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,920
company named imperium

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
i have background on computer science

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
and embedded systems

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
and

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
and i have been working

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,920
in imperium for phishing detection for

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,799
the last two years

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,240
we will we will give

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
a brief review on the fishing global

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
stats

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
that's a general fishing

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
after that we will be covering some

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
specific

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
trends on

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,200
on mobile market and mobile fishing

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
some of the common techniques

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
used for fishing

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
and

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,800
what we can do for phishing detection

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
so starting with

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,360
some global stats

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
information collected by imperium during

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,360
this year

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
show us that

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
more than 50 percent of the the fishing

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
sites are hosting in the united states

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
the this doesn't mean that

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
this 50 50 of the phishing sites are

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,879
targeting

73
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,800
u.s companies but

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
there's a correlation with

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
with these numbers

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
we can also see

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,879
what are the most

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,599
fished brands

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,560
and what are the most fished

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,200
categories if we classify these brands

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
into categories

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,879
we see that more than 50 percent of the

83
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
phishing

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
are targeting

85
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
financial companies or social network

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,119
companies

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,799
we also can say that

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
we have how long a fishing site is

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
leaving

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
we have a

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
a term in a that's named zero day

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
this means

93
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,239
how long a phishing site

94
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
is working before it gets discovered

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,799
or it gets added to

96
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,879
common or public blog lists

97
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
according to simpering data

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
um we see we have an average of five

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,560
hours and up to six days for a fishing

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,319
site to

101
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,799
be active before it gets

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
discovered

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
when we say end day

104
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,600
we mean how long a fish inside is active

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
after it gets discovered

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
and we see that we have an average of

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
two days and as long as one year of a

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
fishing site being active and

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
um

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,320
it continues spreading and

111
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
drinking users after

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
two days or one year

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
now we will um continue to the mobile

114
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
market

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
we can see a trend

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
on the mobile

117
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,479
devices usage

118
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,400
for the last 10 years there has been a

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
big growth on the mobile market

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,199
and the mobile devices usage

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
at the moment

122
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
as we can see here

123
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
we have more than 50 percent

124
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
of the

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
of the users are accessing

126
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
a website on mobile

127
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,440
devices

128
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
and as as

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,639
total numbers we can see a growth of

130
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
year after year in mobile

131
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
usage

132
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,280
so this means that

133
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
the users are constantly

134
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
affected by uh phishing and by attacks

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,639
and if the user are using

136
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,440
each day by day more their

137
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
mobile devices

138
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
they are always getting

139
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
at risk

140
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,479
with this

141
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,120
increase on mobile usage

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
we can also see an increase or a

143
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
a trend on the mobile technology

144
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
trending to mobile

145
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,080
here we have also for web developers the

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
well-known

147
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,080
responsive or adaptive designs

148
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
responsive mean a website that adjusts

149
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,800
all this

150
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
its content

151
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,440
to the final screen so the same html

152
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
adapt

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
the the rendered website to the

154
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
uh the screen that it's rendering or

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,880
showing it to the user

156
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,479
adaptive users adaptive websites

157
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,440
mean

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,919
sites that load a completely different

159
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,520
html accord

160
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,880
according to the

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
device that is that it's a request

162
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,000
requesting the website

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
we can see up to

164
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
a last couple of months

165
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
how are they the

166
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
mobile screen resolution

167
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
shared by by the users

168
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,800
we see that most of the users

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
are seeing websites

170
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,520
in small screens or a small resolution

171
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,880
this means that

172
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,599
the user have less information

173
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,039
uh to decide if the content that that

174
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,880
they are seeing is

175
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,639
is legit or is not

176
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,319
so with

177
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,280
this

178
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
information or with this background

179
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,080
we will start talking about phishing

180
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,520
fishing is growing in complexity

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,039
so we can see

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,199
that in the last

183
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,000
two years we have an increase on sites

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,960
using

185
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
https

186
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,919
from around 30 percent

187
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,440
to more than 50 percent

188
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
this means that

189
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,879
users

190
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,680
trying to trick another users

191
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
or attackers

192
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,360
are requesting a or

193
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
or generating certificates

194
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,360
https means that

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,319
the the communication between the client

196
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
and the server is secured it does not

197
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
mean that the

198
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,519
final website that we are visiting is a

199
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,760
legit one

200
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,559
so this is a common a

201
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
thing that tricks the user when when a

202
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
user

203
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,160
access a https site on a mobile device

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
we can see this

205
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
icon from a lock

206
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,040
it generally um

207
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
tricks the user

208
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
and the user thinks that he is on a on a

209
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
secure website so we we here have two

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
fishing sites one trying to fish office

211
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,519
and a bank

212
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,040
both are not the url from from those

213
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,399
companies

214
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,680
and they are secured connection so

215
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
all of these things can

216
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,240
trigger the user

217
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,440
symphorium research

218
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
also gave us

219
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
some statistics on how the

220
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
the phishing

221
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,200
are targeting mobile

222
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
here we have another graph showing

223
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
phishing sites

224
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,040
collected during the last two years

225
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,920
that have specific content to mobile

226
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,200
device

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
so our phishing sites that

228
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,200
are

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,839
a targeting mobile device or are

230
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,200
rendering in a good way on a cell phone

231
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
or on a tablet

232
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
we see an increase from

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,920
less than 50 percent to

234
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
more than 75 percent in the last two

235
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
years

236
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
we also found

237
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
fish sites

238
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,040
that are um

239
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,480
rendering different

240
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,600
content

241
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
according to the to the device that is

242
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,399
that is asking the

243
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,640
server

244
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
for example we see

245
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
here a phishing site

246
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,519
that

247
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,120
if if it's as

248
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
accessed from a mobile device

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,399
it will be fishing

250
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,680
netflix

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,079
and if it asks access from a desktop

252
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
site

253
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
it will be a

254
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,640
alleged site

255
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,839
in general

256
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,240
attackers do this to avoid

257
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
um

258
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,120
being detected by desktop apps

259
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,240
or by desktop solutions

260
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,959
in general in desktop we have much more

261
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,440
information or much more more compute

262
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,560
power to process and to decide so a

263
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
phishing site

264
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
that is

265
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
rendering a legit site or

266
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,760
like this one

267
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
an error

268
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
on desktop

269
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
tries to avoid the detection

270
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
on on desktop's

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
site

272
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
another common techniques

273
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
or a

274
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,079
common usage of phishing targeting

275
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,079
mobile

276
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,680
is a url padding we see lots of urls

277
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,279
for fishing

278
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,600
with this kind of form

279
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
in here we have a phishing site that is

280
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
trying to fish facebook

281
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,079
and with this kind of urls

282
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,440
probably in some

283
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,240
old

284
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
browsers

285
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,200
a final user can see something like that

286
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
and we and is

287
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
hiding the real domain

288
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
we see that

289
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
at the moment uh

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
around one percent of phishing sites are

291
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
using these techniques

292
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
and the and this is probably because

293
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
modern web

294
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,720
web browsers on mobile

295
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,920
um

296
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
are showing

297
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,839
in a second line the

298
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,600
the real

299
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
domain

300
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
other mobile phishing techniques are

301
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
smashing smishing are

302
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,480
phishing over sms or webs or whatsapp

303
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
and

304
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,880
smashing

305
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
usually

306
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
are using also

307
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
shortening services

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
or tiny urls

309
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,399
tinyurls are um urls used

310
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,000
or services used to shorten a

311
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,839
a long url

312
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
so a legit domain in this case like

313
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
dot lie

314
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,680
is used and if we only analyze that we

315
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
can see that okay bitly

316
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
it's

317
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,399
a legit site but this is redirecting to

318
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,360
another

319
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
website

320
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,519
and also in some

321
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
shortening

322
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,199
urls providers

323
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,920
we can choose what will be

324
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
our

325
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
our

326
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,279
chain

327
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,279
is so a user can

328
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,560
ask for a uh for a url like this one

329
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,079
we don't like

330
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,480
paypal sign in

331
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
and this can try to trick

332
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,639
some users

333
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,480
another techniques used on mobile

334
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
are a

335
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
screen overlay

336
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,959
this is coming from the malware world

337
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,399
because it needs for a malware app to

338
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
install in the in the device

339
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
and

340
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,839
it's an app that it's

341
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,800
render

342
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,959
over another app and

343
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
uh

344
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,399
trying to

345
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,040
mimic a form

346
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,040
in that way still some user credentials

347
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,279
here we can see another example

348
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,480
an app from a bank with a form

349
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,680
over it

350
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
and if we see what what are this app we

351
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
have the real

352
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,440
app bank

353
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
and another app that it's rendering the

354
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,120
form over it

355
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
we have also found

356
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,600
in

357
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,279
some phishing techniques using html5

358
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,240
full screen api

359
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,720
we can see

360
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,519
a site that when it's accessed it

361
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,279
is asking

362
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
to render in

363
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
full screen

364
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
the full screen rendered is an image

365
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,040
trying to mimic

366
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
the

367
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
the

368
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,399
the

369
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,880
way that the user

370
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,959
um

371
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,399
operating system is looking so we here

372
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,399
can see

373
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,680
uh

374
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
a site that when it's rendered in full

375
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,040
screen it is showing an image of a

376
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
quite old

377
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,399
macos

378
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,040
operating system view and

379
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,399
it is rendering a fake url bar

380
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,440
showing bank of america but we see here

381
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,920
that this is not the actual um

382
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
domain that is

383
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,639
asking for this

384
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
so with all these

385
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,800
new or common techniques or

386
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,199
attackers are always trying to

387
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,279
innovate in the new ways of attack

388
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,399
we have to

389
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,480
to think in new ways of phishing

390
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,959
detection

391
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,239
so

392
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,680
most of web browsers

393
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,880
are using a blacklist so we can see the

394
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,519
mobile market market share here

395
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
we see that

396
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
uh

397
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
most of the

398
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,120
the most used

399
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,519
web browsers are chrome and safari

400
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,360
those web browsers are using

401
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,199
a gsf

402
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,880
the blog list by used by you by google

403
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,050
to

404
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,040
[Music]

405
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,559
to to block to stop users from accessing

406
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,000
a website if it's has has been detected

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,720
edge and internet explorer also use

408
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
denied lists

409
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,039
so if we remember the zero days

410
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,160
statistics we see that a phishing site

411
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,439
in general

412
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,959
is active

413
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,520
for five hours before it's it gets

414
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
detected

415
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
so it give us a time of five hours of an

416
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,760
attacker to

417
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
to send and populate its

418
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
attack after before

419
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,000
it's

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
on the block list so we have

421
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,360
in general a lot of time

422
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
for users

423
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,400
unprotected

424
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,200
so we need some zero day

425
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,600
methods or zero day defense

426
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,480
to try to detect those phishing sites at

427
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
the moment they are accessed or at the

428
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,080
moment they are created

429
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
so we we will be

430
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,120
presenting

431
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,559
a machine learning and pipeline or

432
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
or methods

433
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
that are using machine learning

434
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
or analysis

435
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,200
over the url the domain

436
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,320
different contents on the

437
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,320
on the website that we are trying to um

438
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,799
to analyze to decide if it's phishing or

439
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,880
not

440
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
so if we start with

441
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,720
at the left we see that the less

442
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
information we have or the less

443
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
we need to know or to request to the

444
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
site

445
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
to decide if

446
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,880
it's phishing or not and at the right we

447
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
have

448
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
data that

449
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,960
needs a more latency or

450
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,720
we need to download or to get more

451
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,880
information to decide

452
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,400
if we start only with the domain

453
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
um some

454
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
we

455
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,360
start

456
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
um

457
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
we start analyzing the

458
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,480
domain

459
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,039
checking with the blog list

460
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,600
as the browser do

461
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,720
but we can always find

462
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,919
some

463
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,000
some words hidden on the domain for

464
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
example in these cases we have two

465
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,120
domains

466
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,799
that are trying to

467
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,080
to mimic

468
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,799
paypal or facebook

469
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,440
so we have tools to analyze the strings

470
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
and to get

471
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,600
how

472
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,960
similar

473
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,320
these domains or this

474
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
or these chains or characters in the

475
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
domains are two

476
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,280
common fixed brands

477
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,240
also we can find high entropy chains on

478
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,200
the domain like this one this is

479
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
a url from a fishing site

480
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
a domain from a fishing site

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
that have

482
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,840
a really long number or a really long

483
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,320
chain that is a

484
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,080
very common in fishing sites

485
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,679
it's very common to have

486
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,039
phishing sites that are

487
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,280
using some well-known or legit domains

488
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,159
for example in this image we see

489
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,880
a google form

490
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
that it's hosted on google we see the

491
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,840
domain here

492
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,799
docs.google.com

493
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,880
and this form

494
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,440
is trying

495
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,520
to fish

496
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
a tnt

497
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,240
so if we get or we analyze this domain

498
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,919
we will get alleged domain because the

499
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,080
domain is google but it is actually a a

500
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
phishing campaign

501
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,520
trying to steal user credentials

502
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
so if we get

503
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,960
if we rely only on the domain we will

504
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,159
lose

505
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,120
lots

506
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,320
of

507
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,799
real fishing sites

508
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,840
we can continue seeing the full url

509
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,559
in the full url we have

510
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,000
sometimes

511
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
the same

512
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,240
techniques we can use

513
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,360
to detect

514
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,240
common words or um

515
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,720
trying to fussy match some of the

516
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,400
internals

517
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,159
chains on the

518
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,080
on common names

519
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
also trying to get the entropy of the

520
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
url

521
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,280
if we continue in the

522
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,679
in the

523
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
in the amount of information we get from

524
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
a site

525
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,000
we have

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,039
we can

527
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,480
check for the certificate

528
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
the user the attacker is

529
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
is using

530
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,400
we have some good repo reputation

531
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
certificates used for fishing sites we

532
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,799
can see here a site that is trying to

533
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,520
fish the user or to

534
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,919
get some credentials

535
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,000
this is a site hosted on

536
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,280
using https

537
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,720
is getting is using a valid certificate

538
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,120
and we can see

539
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,480
um

540
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,520
at the validity validity times or the

541
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,080
subject alternative names

542
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,000
to try to

543
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,159
to get if this certificate is being used

544
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,640
in other websites or for another purpose

545
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
space

546
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,600
we can also we can also analyze the html

547
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,720
we can download the the full web page

548
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,280
we can see for specific

549
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,640
keywords in the html like login password

550
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
sign in

551
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,440
we can see for tags in the html code

552
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
for forms

553
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
and

554
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,280
we can see if the

555
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,799
html

556
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,600
is trying to run some

557
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
some javascript code

558
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
trying to render something else

559
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,880
and

560
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,000
when we start analyzing the html

561
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,360
we find

562
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,240
things

563
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,080
like this one a

564
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,840
code authentication on the html

565
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
here we see

566
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,200
the html of our website that it's a

567
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,440
fully obfuscated

568
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
it has

569
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
lots of invisible characters

570
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,440
the visible characters are encoded

571
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
a lot of random stylus sections

572
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
so all these techniques are used uh

573
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
to make more difficult to analyze the

574
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,279
html in this case

575
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,320
when we deafosculate this side we can

576
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,919
see here

577
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,600
that the real strings uh

578
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,400
like credit card or

579
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
identity verify

580
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,279
a common

581
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,960
string or

582
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,600
or messages that the attackers are

583
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,559
sending to the user

584
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
at the last of the chain of information

585
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,240
we can get from a

586
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,919
web page

587
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,080
we can download

588
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,440
the media content the css

589
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,000
here in the with the css we can see

590
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,559
if the site will be

591
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,720
responsive

592
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
we can get the fab icons the image we

593
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,279
can follow the external link we can make

594
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,200
a screenshot for the rendered website

595
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,919
so with all this

596
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,360
information

597
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,039
we here

598
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,640
see

599
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
a phishing site

600
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,600
targeting in orange the

601
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,320
the mobile phone company

602
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,840
we see that they are using the favicon

603
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,600
from orange we have the logo from orange

604
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,360
we have a form asking for user

605
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
information

606
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
we have a button asking for user

607
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,080
interaction

608
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
there are these are all resources that

609
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
we can use to decide if this is a

610
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,039
phishing or not

611
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
and we have challenge on the mobile

612
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
world

613
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
to detect this

614
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,240
because if we are on desktop we have

615
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
all the power from a desktop

616
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
and all the information that we can see

617
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,799
from a browser with a browser extension

618
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,840
on mobile we usually have less cpu and

619
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,880
ram we have battery constraints

620
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
and

621
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,679
they are not so common to have browser

622
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,880
extensions

623
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
on

624
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,039
on mobile browsers

625
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
so external tools

626
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,080
that are

627
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,880
not built in the browser

628
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,320
have difficulties to access or to see

629
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
the full information on on the on the

630
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
side that the user is trying to access

631
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
some a lot of time we have sandboxes

632
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
process and

633
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,480
a security application is not able

634
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
to see

635
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,799
all the information

636
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,279
and we also a lot of times we have

637
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,440
connectivity or privacy constraints

638
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,520
not always it is possible

639
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,039
to send to a back-end a

640
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,919
for an offline or for uh

641
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
or for a

642
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
backend analysis

643
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
of a website

644
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,480
because

645
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,880
sometimes we have no connection or

646
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,039
sometimes we have privacy constraints

647
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
so

648
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
how can be

649
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,720
a

650
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
effective mobile phishing detection

651
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
system

652
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
we need to

653
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,399
um

654
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,439
we need to have a

655
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,720
and

656
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,240
a mobile application that is

657
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
defending the user for installing apps

658
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,520
and

659
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,880
as a

660
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,399
as a malware detection engine

661
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,440
and at the same time we need to

662
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
defend the user for the urls they are

663
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,200
visiting

664
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,360
we need to

665
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,200
detect on device what um

666
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,559
what are the

667
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,640
urls or or what are safe websites

668
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,039
and what they are not

669
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,159
and we

670
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,480
have to have the

671
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,720
the possibility to to have a

672
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,120
offline

673
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,840
um

674
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
analysis

675
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,480
we say that whitelist and blacklist are

676
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,600
dangerous

677
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,039
on their own because they are prone to

678
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,600
a to zero days attacks

679
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
but we have to combine them

680
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,480
and use them because blacklist work when

681
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,399
they are updated

682
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,880
and whitelist work to avoid false

683
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
positives

684
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,399
but we need at one device fast and

685
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,320
real-time aggressive phishing detection

686
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,600
and we need also to combine this with a

687
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,960
more heavy

688
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
analysis

689
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,039
on

690
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,840
server

691
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,279
so at last here are some

692
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,480
useful links related to fishing

693
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,960
and related to

694
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,320
attacks in argentina

695
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,279
and

696
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,240
thanks for watching i am

697
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,760
i will be here to

698
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,399
to ask and to respond some of your

699
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,080
questions

700
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,399
thanks all
