1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,840
hi thank you for having me at bluespace

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,480
my name is xena olson also known as

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
cheerio on twitter and i'm going to

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,599
share with you today how i transitioned

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,880
from cti to hunt

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
but before i do i have a very very quick

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,199
note from the lawyers i'm here in my

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,039
individual capacity

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,680
representing my own views and not

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,320
speaking on behalf of my employers

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,480
and that any vendor that i'm that i

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
mention or reference does not

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,558
necessarily endorse them as a vendor

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,840
all right

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,160
so now that that's done

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,360
basically

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879
i want to increase my technical skill

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,120
set and i want to be able to do

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,039
more technical work on a day-to-day

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,360
basis in my daily

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
activities in my daily job

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,079
so i felt that a way that i could

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,800
accomplish this goal of mine was to

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,079
transition

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
into a hunting capacity plus i love data

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,120
so

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
i broke it down into four different

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
categories that i'll share with you all

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,640
the steps that i took

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,880
and the first one was research the

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,280
second one lots of practice

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,760
number three i phoned a friend i spoke

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,159
with other professionals that are in the

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,840
threat hunting role

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,520
and then finally i ended up practicing

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,560
for an actual gig

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,200
so first we'll address some research and

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
i broke it down into four categories so

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,159
when i first started in cti i would read

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,960
everything i could on the sans

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
reading room and then also i'd attend

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
their their webinars that they had any

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,720
sand summit

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,799
i could get my hands on or attend or

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
watch on youtube i would go and do that

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
and so i of course

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
already had a bunch of that material

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,600
that i've read matt bromley has a really

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,240
great paper on threat hunting i highly

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,719
recommend checking it out

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
and so from there i was able to pivot to

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,880
different social media capacities

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,280
facebook has a group called threat

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,000
hunting linkedin has an actual account

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
called threat hunting they post some

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
really great stuff

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,920
just searching hashtag hunting tip of

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
the day or threat hunting pulled up a

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
ton of accounts and a ton of resources

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,560
for me to review as i could for research

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
and the whole purpose of all of that is

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
so that i could ask better questions

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
and another thing is all of the talks

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,840
and defcons and and all of that that i

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
went to black hat and rsa

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,959
i would make it a point to attend any

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
type of threat hunting related anything

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
and so that also helps solidify a lot of

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,599
the concepts

70
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,440
and get me to a place where i could

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
actually speak about it in an interview

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
and then finally discords and slacks i'm

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
a huge fan

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,640
of defcon's blue team village and they

75
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
have a channel specifically for threat

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
hunting and there's a ton of other ones

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
out there anyone that you can plug into

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,239
where you feel welcomed and you get the

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,239
information that you need i recommend

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,159
doing it

81
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,959
and next is a slide of

82
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,080
basically some really great uh twitter

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
accounts it's not all of them it's just

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
it's some of them uh that come up in my

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,519
feed and that have provided information

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,440
that i have felt has been extremely

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,400
helpful in my transition from cti to

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,720
hunt

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,599
also too there's some really great blogs

90
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,560
out there

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,760
the d4 report i'm a patron of theirs

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
there's a really good book out there

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
practical threat intelligence and data

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
driven threat hunting that i recommend

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
reading

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,239
a lot of the red team related blogs are

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,599
really great

98
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,080
as far as getting into the technical

99
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
nitty gritty details that you need as a

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
threat hunter to be able to understand

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
the attacks

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
another one that's really great is size

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,239
threat thursday i love how they bring in

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
different research from the community

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,280
and make

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
an actual purple team type exercise that

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,599
you can leverage in your own

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,120
organization

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
i also read through

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,479
whether it's sigma rules or vr rules and

111
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,560
try to understand how it is that they're

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,720
detecting these attacks

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,759
and

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,720
so whatever resource you find helpful

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
of course mitre attack uh no talk would

116
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
be complete without that

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
without that mention whatever you find

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,160
useful to you read it as much as you can

119
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
consume as much information as you can

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,479
next is practice

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,320
so the goal with all of the practice i

122
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
broke it down into four areas is

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,080
preparation

124
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
i wanted to be prepared as i possibly

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,240
could

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,960
be for the interviews and for a future

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
role

128
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
uh you know i i would like to see myself

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,320
as a resource at an organization so

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
everything that i'm learning everything

131
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
that i'm putting in all of the effort

132
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,960
and time

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
will ultimately benefit whatever

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
organization decides to hire me so

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
the first thing is you can work with

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
your current employer in the cti role

137
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
and either

138
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
run down some sock tickets and get

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
really hands-on investigative techniques

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
and analysis

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
through the sock or even your hunt team

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
whoever whoever's willing to to let you

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
uh ride along you can also

144
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
volunteer to create reports for hunt or

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
purple team so that way it'll get give

146
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,639
you a better idea as far as what type of

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,440
research you need to perform and how to

148
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
how to formulate the reports and how to

149
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
formulate their research so that it's

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
consumable and actionable for other

151
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520
teams

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
another thing that i did i did the

153
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
splunk fundamentals training the free

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,039
one

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,479
back in 2018 but i decided

156
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,520
since

157
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
searching and being able to parse

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,680
through large and vast amounts of data

159
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
is very important that i should probably

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
do that again just in case so i did

161
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,199
boss of the sock is also another really

162
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,919
great resource splunk also has an attack

163
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,960
range that i highly recommend setting up

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,919
or at least being aware of so that you

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,319
know in your day job you can use it as a

166
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,639
resource if you need it now the other

167
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
thing that i did is i gave a talk

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,319
so

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
what i did is i i pretty much showed how

170
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,080
cti could take

171
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,800
junk malware junk data blocked blocked

172
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
email blocked attacks

173
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
and make it valuable to the purple team

174
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
and so i'll just step through it really

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
quick uh so that you can get an idea of

176
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,680
what it was and i build on those skills

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
for being an actual threat hunting

178
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,039
professional

179
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,440
another thing is whenever i came across

180
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,759
any type of threat intelligence

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,720
any red team related blog anything like

182
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,199
that i would think about

183
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,639
how i would essentially hunt it so for

184
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
instance this is kind of the the

185
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
questions that i'd ask myself like what

186
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,840
does this badness what would it look

187
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
like in the logs like what would i

188
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
expect to see

189
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,599
and then where would i find it you know

190
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,560
what i find in the proxy or like where

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
and then once i got an actual threat

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,479
hunting job

193
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
i ask those questions still every single

194
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,639
day but then i add into it what how how

195
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,560
how do i do the needful and the

196
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,879
translation of that is

197
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,520
what will this search look like

198
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,240
so this has been really helpful for me

199
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
as far as transitioning from cti to hunt

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
and looking at data from a different

201
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,800
perspective

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
so this right here the threat intel

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
process is

204
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
where i did the talk and the research on

205
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
how cti can contribute to purple team

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,479
exercises and you'll see that the vast

207
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,479
majority of it is looking at command

208
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
line arguments mainly for

209
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
uh the purpose of the red team to be

210
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
able to emulate whatever the type of

211
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
attack it is that they're

212
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
that you're running down so in this

213
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,199
particular example that i'll run through

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,599
it's an actual hawkeye sample that was

215
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,400
blocked from a real organization

216
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,039
so i would pivot through the sandboxes

217
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
some cases joe sandbox i really loved

218
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,039
malware bazaar

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,679
and then i would couple it with atomic

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,880
red team

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,958
if if there were any like how did how

222
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,640
did they actually

223
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
make this technique work like how how

224
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,160
how did they do this right so

225
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
atomic red team was helpful the red team

226
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,360
blogs like i said earlier that was very

227
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,839
helpful stack overflow was also helpful

228
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,360
and google

229
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,480
so i just literally grabbed the miter

230
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
attack kill chain across the top with

231
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
all the tactics

232
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,959
and then from there i put out the

233
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,640
particular attack chain for that

234
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
particular hawkeye sample

235
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,880
and

236
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
showed how basically grabbing a malware

237
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,399
sample

238
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,000
you can

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
get enough information out of it to

240
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
perform a purple team exercise

241
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,399
and

242
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
kind of see where you land

243
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,880
in the event any of your controls fail

244
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
so for instance i literally went to

245
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
stack overflow and atomic red team for

246
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
this one here

247
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,920
privilege escalation they use dll side

248
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
side loading for this one

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,680
and then process injection

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
so

251
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,839
let's

252
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
see and here it's really interesting so

253
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,839
i looked at some of the detections

254
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
related to this particular sample and

255
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,120
this is a yar rule i believe from

256
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,079
gosh 2015. that was a long time ago

257
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
and it was still catching the sample and

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
many samples so

259
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,680
just thinking about how i would use that

260
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
to find samples within my own

261
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
environment

262
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
how i would look at masquerading within

263
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,240
my environment from a hunt perspective

264
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,959
credentialed access

265
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,399
how would i look at that in our logs

266
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
collection

267
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,399
would i be able to find that

268
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,399
on the endpoint

269
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,360
command and control so the c2 matrix

270
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
it's an open source project

271
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
that you can contribute to if you want

272
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
so here's another avenue

273
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,279
you pull down the slingshot

274
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,320
vm

275
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,640
related to the c2 matrix and then you

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
can find out if there's specific

277
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
detections or tool marks related to that

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
and share that with the community so

279
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
that's another way that you can leverage

280
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
your time and contribute to open source

281
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
projects as well

282
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
exfiltration impact i really didn't

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
spend very much time on impact just

284
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
because it's a production environment

285
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,720
um

286
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
so and next we're on to the third phase

287
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
and that is speaking with a professional

288
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,399
so whenever i speak with a professional

289
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,000
i try to

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
view it as their time as money and

291
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
they're doing me a favor

292
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,720
uh to share their expertise with me and

293
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
kind of point me in the right direction

294
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,560
so

295
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,880
i try to think of what type of mentee

296
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
would i like to have and then i try to

297
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
be that for this professional so i give

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,880
them very very very specific questions

299
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
with outcomes or specific goals tied to

300
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
those questions

301
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,399
and then i integrate the feedback and

302
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,480
you rinse and repeat essentially until

303
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,040
you become a resource and people ask you

304
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
where do you find this the other day i

305
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
was able to share threat hunting

306
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,639
resources with someone else that wants

307
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,959
to pivot into threat hunting so that's

308
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,959
that's a win

309
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,760
and i also let the person that helped me

310
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,800
plug

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,880
say thank you so much

312
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
you know because of your guidance i was

313
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,079
able to land a job in threat hunting and

314
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,560
pursue a new career

315
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,360
so give them feedback

316
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
and finally getting a gig so i build on

317
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
all of my cti skills beforehand that you

318
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,519
saw with the command line arguments and

319
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,880
helping

320
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
present research for the red team to be

321
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,680
able to emulate the particular attacks

322
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
well from there i needed to focus more

323
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,480
on the blue side of it and

324
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,959
okay so this type of attack what type of

325
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,440
processes are involved with it what type

326
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
of windows event ids

327
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,639
sysmon

328
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,279
registry key changes all of that right

329
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,000
so i started to focus more of my

330
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,959
research in that area as far as prepping

331
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,200
and understanding stuff so that i could

332
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,480
be

333
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
even more valuable to the organization

334
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,959
once they bring me on

335
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,160
so i focused my research for

336
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,959
getting a goal and the

337
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
for getting a gig excuse me and the end

338
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,600
goal is application so i broke it down

339
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
into three areas the first one was

340
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
getting really good and understanding

341
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,720
mitre attack techniques and i picked you

342
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,959
know like three and you get really good

343
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
at being able to

344
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
speak to them uh to a very

345
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,079
technical and knowledgeable audience and

346
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
then the next one was reviewing csa and

347
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,240
public threat reports so for those i

348
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,199
prepared a minimum of an hour worth of

349
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,079
content to share and speak with the

350
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,040
interview team there's sometimes a

351
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,639
a bunch of people that you're speaking

352
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,800
with like i i think there is one where

353
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,760
there was

354
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,480
i think five maybe more

355
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
of these highly skilled highly

356
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
knowledgeable professionals so that when

357
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
they're asking questions i will have

358
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
information related to that

359
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,519
uh ready to go

360
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,160
and then the third one is i stayed up to

361
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
date with the infosec current events

362
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,279
essentially

363
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
um and i did my best to understand it at

364
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
a deep technical level

365
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,839
and that will help you in the interviews

366
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,279
and i also

367
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,680
kind of approached everything from the

368
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,240
foundation of a framework from all the

369
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
reading and all the research and all the

370
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,320
stuff that i did i came up with this and

371
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
it's my

372
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,760
version of a threat hunting cycle that i

373
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,639
use to this day when i'm performing

374
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,639
threat hunting and basically it's

375
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,839
research

376
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
and hypothesis generation

377
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
and then it goes to analysis so this is

378
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,199
where you do the data collection

379
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
you create the searches you run the

380
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
hunts you perform the analysis and then

381
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,279
it goes to the conclusions and that's

382
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,680
where you can either reject or accept

383
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
your hypothesis your findings your

384
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,399
mitigation strategies any lessons

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,480
learned and then finally

386
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,959
i believe that any hunts

387
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
that you can it's a good idea to

388
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
automate them so i put detections in

389
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,560
there as well

390
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
so there are a couple different areas

391
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,399
that you can go with the application of

392
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,680
data you can either look at the internal

393
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,720
related threat hunting or external so a

394
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
good a good way to think of it is cobalt

395
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,680
strike hunting you can look at cobalt

396
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
strike in the wild or you can look at

397
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
how you would hunt cobalt strike that's

398
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,279
actually in your network and so i

399
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,240
focused more on the internal environment

400
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
both of them are legitimate and both of

401
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,680
them are used in threat hunting i just

402
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
prefer to focus on the internal threat

403
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,279
hunting to start

404
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,199
and then i also

405
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,519
consume the data based on structured or

406
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,199
unstructured so

407
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,240
for some of it uh structured is known

408
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
ttps ioks and artifacts and unstructured

409
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,920
is kind of the unknown threat you know

410
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,720
are

411
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
how are you going to do statistical

412
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
analysis and find

413
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
essentially the needle in the haystack

414
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
so i would try to think of two different

415
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
ways

416
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
of hunting the data in different

417
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
techniques

418
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,320
and on unknowns

419
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
and also to any threat hunting talk

420
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,279
without david j bianco

421
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,600
you know i just i just couldn't help but

422
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
mention his pyramid of pain

423
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
so when i was reading the threat reports

424
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,920
i would make sure to focus on ttps

425
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,639
tools and artifacts and then i would

426
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
view that from

427
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,880
both the host and network level and

428
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,560
think about

429
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
the type of hunts that i could create

430
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,959
based on that and i organized the hour

431
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,759
of content based on the pyramid of pain

432
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
and my frame threat hunting framework

433
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,160
that i showed you before so that way

434
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,079
when i'm speaking to the people that are

435
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,839
interviewing me it has some sort of

436
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,039
structure and format to it

437
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,640
what i also did is i organized

438
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,919
the different

439
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,359
time that i spent in the different

440
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,679
regions so that i could get an idea okay

441
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,439
so i spent a lot of time on research

442
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,559
this week

443
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,520
so

444
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
i should probably

445
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,039
apply it possibly so then i would focus

446
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,559
on applying it

447
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,520
because

448
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,480
practice is great too i also included

449
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,720
that

450
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,919
so

451
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,080
basically i stepped through all the ways

452
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,520
that i prepared for a role in threat

453
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,919
hunting and how i prepared for

454
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
transitioning from cti to threat hunting

455
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,559
i build i built on my existing cti

456
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
skills so that i could be

457
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,360
amazing in threat hunting and providing

458
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,400
value

459
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
right out the gate and so that was my

460
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,720
goal um you know with research basically

461
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
you want to know where to find the stuff

462
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,760
and to ask better questions

463
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
practice um

464
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,559
really every threat report that you read

465
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,440
just think how how would i hunt that

466
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,960
where would i look

467
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,760
and

468
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,000
if if you're into splunk and all of that

469
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,160
what would the searches look like

470
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,480
and then finally just be very very

471
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
practical with the application of

472
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
whatever the the learning that you're

473
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
doing and be consistent

474
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,000
uh like it takes time it doesn't just

475
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
happen overnight

476
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,960
so be patient with yourself and thank

477
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,840
you so

478
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,480
much i appreciate you and your time i

479
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,520
hope you enjoy uh blue space and echo

480
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,559
party and have a great rest of your

481
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,559
2021.
