1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,500
well we're back thanks for waiting it's not the seconds now it's the

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,889
 moment of his beast in xàbia for ron arancibia kevin santos and agustín march

3
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:17,390
 they will not be presenting westat nois and for interpreting turin

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,910
 approaches personally I must say that we were acb little in the care

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,440
 space and it was a very valuable presentation so I hope you enjoy it

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,520
 as much as we enjoyed it at the time guys if you want all yours

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,900
 Well thank you very much first of all thank you all for him

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:43,580
 space of time and by connecting we work in mcafee we are

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,730
 being part of a team that is starting with this as a data scientist in

10
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,930
 security is made up of whoever tells you that I saw santos arancibia sofía and

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,090
 agustín march and our team is basically in the part of

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,720
 content of what the product is in idiart vision and we generate analytics not

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,320
 there is content for that product i am going to share my screen with you

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,330
 tell me if it looks good there is perfect barbarian

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:26,220
 well what we are going to talk a little about today is going to be an introduction like that

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,679
 How are the analytics that we can get to get, let's say within the scope

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,300
 of the law infosec yes they were painted without remembering if you can

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,720
 activate your camera if it is already deactivated

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,210
 ok according to dicta

20
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,240
 so I think it's m pixel or a little bit if the camera was activated ok ok like

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,470
 you prefer no problem

22
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,730
 I'm going to leave like this, better well, we have for today this is

23
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,720
 the agenda we have, we are going to do a little introduction to what are the

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,470
 apt that these advanced persistence attacks

25
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,359
 and then we are going to talk a little about what are lol bass what are these

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,270
 tules provided by the operating systems and

27
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,460
 give you the ability to be able to perform an attack quite stealthily if

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:38,010
 We are going to delve a little into what are the analytics that we generate from

29
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:46,590
 our workplace today how are we going to see a couple of examples of how

30
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,420
 we apply these analytics and social will be showing you a little of this and

31
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,500
 tell a little about the challenges we face as a team

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,610
 more than anything forming this science and applying it to this which is infosec well

33
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,380
 well let's talk first as I told you about what the apt are

34
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:17,549
 if these apt are well attack campaigns of cyberattacks that generally

35
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:24,690
 have a target and a defined and well-studied objective and

36
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,250
 they are usually carried out by entities such as group companies

37
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:37,320
 activists states and governments well the part the particularity that this

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,049
 type of attacks and as his name calls it are that they are

39
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,689
 advanced attacks if they try to be carried out in a

40
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:52,000
 stealthy and persistent here in the image we see how the

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,220
 anatomy of an attack if this is a short example

42
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,300
 that is more than anything oriented something that we will see a little later

43
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,280
 about the binaries what would be the still good plan first

44
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,010
 that nothing compromises an email server in this example if the attacker

45
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:22,320
 you can commit that either from fiji and then use binaries or scripts that already

46
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,810
 are installed in the 200m point of the victim's machines to execute

47
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,460
 malicious commands will later become a champion of

48
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:40,690
 passwords and gain privileges escalate those privileges to have control

49
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,650
 from one of those terminals and this brings us to the main objective

50
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:52,039
 of that type of attack that is to seize confidential files or

51
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:59,240
 encrypted that the victim entity has yes and in parallel to this another let's say

52
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,520
 part of the goal is to leave an open door to achieve that persistence and

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,500
 in the future, every time you want to obtain those files, you will not have access

54
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,650
 leave that backdoor there is ready alright

55
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,320
 let's see a little how we differentiate something from that only

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,610
 malware that is an attack that you had a bad chance of

57
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,289
 touched let's say what is a fancy

58
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,639
 what are the main characteristics of apt attacks this type of

59
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,279
 campaigns first good as we already said that they are very stealthy and require a

60
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:50,360
 continuous hacking process if these processes occur in multiple steps

61
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,110
 they are usually orchestrated by humans

62
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,670
 and as we said they have a target defined a specific entity

63
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:07,599
 generally represent a group of highly trained people

64
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,250
 they have a lot of resources available a lot of weapons

65
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:20,710
 let's call them and they know how to use them they plan they have a plan

66
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,940
 with extreme detail how you go to the introduction if very campaigns are

67
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,000
 large students are studying for months what will be the entrance door of that

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,390
 entity that is going to attack if you make a presentation yesterday that Emiliano said

69
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,500
 I was talking about this of collecting emails and other good image it will be to do that all that

70
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,380
 I study all that social engineering for months if it's like an attack

71
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,900
 very important is what is planned then there are certain targets that are more

72
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,330
 sensitive than others and that we say weaker links within each entity

73
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,700
 for example in companies where generally it is not given it is not given

74
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,270
 much much ball, let's say generic malware, there are alerts and we

75
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,549
 draws attention when there are threats in those entities and

76
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,190
 you don't see them until it's late so there are many examples in real life

77
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:30,240
 of the data liquid and in this graph that we see on the right

78
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,540
 the screen this cone shows how the impact is going

79
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,120
 according to a malware attack for being a victim of opportunism, let's say

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,580
 make focus called by an apt campaign

81
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,770
 yes the impact of the threat

82
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:58,180
 going to go from a person an individual for example may lose some

83
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,479
 personal data bank accounts for example is the loss of money will be

84
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,639
 relative to what that person has I but as the entity grows the

85
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,610
 threat is greater and what can be lost also if they can be lost

86
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:22,180
 large data banks millions of dollars will already go to complaints the

87
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,669
 mark now of all these campaigns that are seen

88
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:31,729
 how super gross how we do to defend ourselves from these attacks

89
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,699
 well first of all what they say

90
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,120
 the books is to understand the attacker if he is being the attacker

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,580
 we have this pass we are based on this framework which is the

92
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,339
 lockheed martin cyber kitchen representing seven steps or seven links

93
00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:00,800
 if it is a chain from the opponent's point of view

94
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,819
 and these seven links are through which the attacker has to pass in order to

95
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,720
 Reach your goal

96
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,239
 the purpose of this is to be able to detect the attacker as soon as possible and not only

97
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,529
 detect it but also create a barrier to protect or block it

98
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:26,019
 well let's quickly review this graphic I hope it would not be so pixelated

99
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:32,589
 the first link does not speak, it speaks to us of recognition that it is to harvest a bag

100
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:38,079
 of emails from addresses related to the entity that is going to be attacked if

101
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:45,449
 this social engineering the second step is handsome nor station would be armed see

102
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,580
 what explosives can be used to enter that

103
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,800
 entity which are the best audio files that

104
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,689
 can be used passing the third link we have which

105
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,980
 delivery is going to be let's say how that attack is going to get those exploits that already

106
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,490
 we prepare

107
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:14,160
 if it is going to be via fishing by physical web email with a usb

108
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,860
 in our fourth link we have exploitation that is already executing code in

109
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,730
 the victim's machine has already been entered

110
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,990
 In the fifth link, the fifth step would be you can already cut malware and the sixth

111
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,570
 It would be to take control and start doing this from the lateral moments and be able to

112
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:43,290
 have remote control of the set points of the machines and the seventh and last step

113
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,209
 would be to get the information that would be the final objective of the attack of the

114
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,008
 campaign well then we have seven

115
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,320
 opportunities to break that chain to put that lock

116
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,020
 let's go to the next one well I'm going to talk to him a bit let's probe a bit

117
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,240
 what is the matrix of maitre if today cybersecurity companies

118
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,160
 we take as a knowledge base the matrix maitre d

119
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,670
 which will show us techniques and tactics of the adversaries based on

120
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:25,160
 real world observations yes to see if this can make you

121
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,819
 sum

122
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:35,930
 I think I don't know how to render very well, well, basically, it's what we

123
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,479
 we see in each column the name is closely related to what the chain is

124
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,610
 of the steps are what here are more steps

125
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,790
 but it goes from left to right with what is recognition enters the

126
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:00,630
 system and others those would be our tactics well and each of those cells

127
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,460
 has the technique what are the techniques and are that the

128
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,570
 way in which that tactic or action is going to be carried out

129
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,180
 nowadays in the financial you can see examples of graphs from last year

130
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:27,380
 but it does not tell us what the trend is, which is what is most seen as a technique if

131
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:34,500
 we see that powers he is the most used technique followed by script and x server 32

132
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,730
 those names that he masters the techniques with his side and if they enter the

133
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,930
 page my ter that is down here in link I do not know if they will see it

134
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,560
 We share them there, yes, can you please share them?

135
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,400
 in the chat

136
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,349
 and the matrices of both financial campaigns and other types of

137
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,760
 campaigns and all based on real life events yes

138
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:12,179
 let's talk a bit since we mentioned to powers him what are the

139
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,569
 loas

140
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:22,540
 the two glasses basically these islands is living of the pod vision scripts

141
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,219
 and what is this? reads lan wines is the term that is

142
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,950
 used to say let's live on those that the earth provides us

143
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:39,690
 How is this related to cyberattacks, well basically these

144
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:46,220
 are the binary scripts and libraries that the operating system provides you and this

145
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,590
 it started with the tool is that it provides you with windows

146
00:13:50,590 --> 00:14:00,310
 It is a very large project, what started is in progress, the project is free

147
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,930
 to be able to contribute things lopez or

148
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,910
 guys i think it's norwegian if i'm not mistaken edward mod

149
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,160
 if a few years ago and basically all the tulles that

150
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,990
 They are by default in the operating system if one can use them to

151
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,610
 attack yes

152
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,079
 what is problematic about this and how are the operating system's rules

153
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:37,310
 imagine that everything is there crippled so it gives us the possibility of being able

154
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:44,899
 for example download scripts or run them without raising the alarm already

155
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,590
 that I am using a trustworthy tool

156
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,360
 well, this also gives us the possibility of achieving persistence and that it is one of

157
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,740
 the characteristics of the apt as we already said without having to

158
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,290
 install any files in the operating system can you run the codes

159
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:12,410
 directly from memory you use these two-way tools as well

160
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,990
 for example you can run things from download things using office

161
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,780
 point outlook point exe

162
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,379
 and what are some good blue ones that we have powers and scripts both visual

163
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:36,030
 basic scripts w mm and cats ps excel here I also leave the link if they can pass it

164
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,780
 for the repository the ol bass is very good for a look

165
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:48,739
 Well, how do we work with this basically?

166
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:56,329
 due to the financial campaigns that exist today, it was discovered that

167
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,439
 using a lot of these rules to make attacks

168
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,890
 for the stealthy yes then we for example grab

169
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:12,430
 with the mcafee products we take all three all the events that happen

170
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,550
 in the machines of our clients that is sent a cloud to be able to be

171
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,800
 analyzed and we said good since we are going to

172
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,569
 analyze, let's see for example that we have some analytics that we did how many

173
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:31,469
 are you going to catch a day of processes events of processes that are

174
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,559
 generated in a client and who has this I think they are twelve thousand twelve thousand something

175
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,189
 machines and of all events, note the total

176
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:49,650
 there are 15 million 700 thousand events of which two million six hundred

177
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,280
 there are a thousand you go, this does not mean that it is all bad

178
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,680
 malicious are events that are analyzed only but we with this computer

179
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,750
 with the possibility of using data science we can get analytics out of this

180
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:09,929
 see what's happening, check if I'm ready of those two million

181
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,740
 and a half which are the most viewed we have is script

182
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:22,119
 cmd w I made myself particularly these two is written and it gives me the most

183
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:29,889
 amount of events they have if one then yes and if surely almost all

184
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,910
 applications that run in the background have their execution in cmd and others

185
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,610
 but that being so much data gives us the possibility being the attacker that

186
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,530
 have less chance of being detected imagine it is not the same to hide

187
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:53,990
 throwing a powers the damn and that the antivirus detects you

188
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,919
 hide among this million data if it is much more difficult to be detected

189
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,970
 then from this analysis we say why

190
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,810
 we have to pay attention to this is the best thing here I have the

191
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,690
 four processes that headed the previous list and let's see what it says there are three

192
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:21,290
 of these four binaries if, for example, cmd associates it with each of these, it does not

193
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,990
 I mentioned but in the all bass repository it has a list of all those that are the

194
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,550
 you go so far known if they see the list is for example power no longer

195
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,409
 see although it is a system tool

196
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,540
 but generally called by other yes and powers he is like everyone else apart

197
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,740
 quite complex

198
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:50,649
 well then maitre is mapped all is all that is amateur projects

199
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,190
 to each technique and from smd we can see the technique for example ms ht to yes that is

200
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:04,809
 to call html code that is associated with the evasion tactic of

201
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:11,950
 defense and execution of ss script also in defense action has is associated

202
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:20,670
 to the technique ntfs file a tribute w I made myself also has its technique well

203
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,790
 from that a mother can go and see when she sees those code samples that

204
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,320
 run from malicious commands and we'll have an idea

205
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,080
 we can already provide an idea for example to a team almost hunting

206
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:45,168
 that is our main side let's say we can provide analytics to others

207
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:49,050
 teams all this in order to improve the

208
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,770
 product

209
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:59,840
 here we have some examples are also to be in the repository of ol bass

210
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,949
 for example of command line executions that are thrown with each of these

211
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,580
 tulle is that we live from 4 o'clock these four tops

212
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,770
 we have an execution of the cmb excel point that is already executed in pay load a

213
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:21,510
 script that basically goes from defense with a persistence mechanism

214
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,460
 here we have to run the calculator with administrator privileges

215
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,350
 directly from w excel with this limit a strip the

216
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:37,049
 calculator with an admin privilege run internet code with run dl

217
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,510
 32 if we see that it has almost been called

218
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:49,700
 javascript that this one goes to know where but hey are examples of toys not

219
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:59,380
 see this this we have found real cases in our data where

220
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:06,200
 they maintain patterns of this style so a star is lowered in the execution

221
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,940
 they are generally much more obfuscated, they are followed to the letter

222
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,680
 but there are real cases and we have been able to see them

223
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,900
 well come on and something I wanted to tell you about

224
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:33,640
 how we use this is also another example of ourselves the mixed one that

225
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:41,690
 We call the one that executes html and we have extracted thanks to these analytics

226
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,519
 an example where we went to look for all the processes that are mixed already

227
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,269
 they themselves we look for all the children and all the parents that we call

228
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:55,669
 processes children and parents or in the parents are from which it was invoked it praises

229
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:02,870
 Yes, they can also be other larvae and when we look for the children, they are

230
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:10,639
 invoked these events well so we managed to find a whole path of

231
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:15,229
 an attack that the father started started doing classroom

232
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:23,690
 from mixed I ended up invoking a powers which had encrypted code in

233
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:31,650
 base 64 and that was done, it executed quite malicious code but

234
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,820
 For example, this attack route that we take with that analytics we

235
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,550
 served to give a report both to a detection team not so much as a

236
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,840
 team that does handling and I can tell you that look what we are seeing what

237
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,669
 is happening and that same analysis we try to replicate

238
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:54,350
 The for example in other clients where out there they had never found out that

239
00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:00,020
 they had that type of attack, that's not why it is the importance we give to wolves

240
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,270
 Now these analytics will continue, sofía will show you

241
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,560
 a little bit he will comment on how we carry out or which is one of

242
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,450
 the processes we do to remove some of this noise and remove some of the

243
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,990
 command analysis noise particularly if

244
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,940
 Sofia

245
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:32,820
 Well thank you very much to all of you for being here and well how will you see of all that

246
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:39,270
 vine was commenting previously there are a lot of edges to attack when

247
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,470
 it is about security and there are many tools also for that many

248
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,470
 things to pay attention to in our case as a team of

249
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,010
 analytics in our raw material are the activities that occur

250
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:59,910
 in an entity in a in a pc and we take care of carrying out

251
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:07,500
 tools that tell us that in a certain way that data is going to speak

252
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,550
 so well as part of the analytics that are more mature today by

253
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:19,100
 Today in what is infosec we have good mail mail and malware classification

254
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,740
 The detection of anomalies and analysis of network data are followed, etc.

255
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,710
 that good however these models are generally not exposed

256
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,600
 directly to the user but, as Kevin commented before, they serve as the

257
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,419
 10 feedback or generators of new criteria to improve the set of

258
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:47,820
 detections that I tried other other equipment is not true

259
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,740
 if we spend one more

260
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,220
 there are good many many native tools of the operating system that are

261
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,860
 can be used to carry out malicious activities that obviously for being

262
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,280
 native operating system are not the first thing that is generally

263
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,660
 one is going to distrust when it should be done because these tools

264
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,160
 can be used in many ways can be used in combination with many

265
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,990
 arguments with many other processes commented that the issue of processes comes

266
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,830
 parents and child processes build large chains of executions

267
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,110
 that it can become something totally suspicious for the subject due to the fact

268
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,918
 of the tools that are involved but nevertheless if we do an analysis of

269
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,510
 the arguments that are used or those of the files that are loaded or if there are

270
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,490
 some some pattern in codecating renamed binaries and so on

271
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,590
 we can come to realize that there was actually that chain of

272
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:57,090
 executions is not so little malicious let's call it good then

273
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:02,158
 as a data science team, as I mentioned, we have the matter

274
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,529
 raw of which is basically data data without a fixed structure is basically

275
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:13,500
 we have different types of events each event has its fields and they open

276
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,779
 ports and chatted in processes and secure files were created

277
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:22,190
 and particularly for our for our project that we are carrying out

278
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,950
 out today we are focusing on what are the command lines

279
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:33,279
 and for that as any dating process they will know that we need to understand how

280
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,090
 It is like this structure although I commented that we have no data

281
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:43,959
 structured at some point we need to understand what patterns are followed or what

282
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,350
 how is that behavior like those executions yes and if we have a

283
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,590
 mean length between commands which command is most commonly called

284
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,790
 followed by which other what are the parameters of each command and others a

285
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:07,480
 pretty thorough study if you want of how these states look like

286
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,830
 commands so that we can begin to infer certain things

287
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:20,179
 then we pass by if we take as an example this command in

288
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,250
 that I show you here well let's see that we have an executor in this case it is

289
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,500
 sm point exe we have arguments with what runs we have what is

290
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,700
 executing the arguments of what is being executed notice that we have in

291
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,720
 reality 222 tools that are running connected by a country

292
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,180
 each one with its input values ​​and others the volume of data as

293
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:52,100
 this one that we process per day can show that commands like this are

294
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,149
 repeat an infinity of times and if we analyze this that I am

295
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,320
 showing there are actually variations in some of the fields but that in

296
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,100
 I do not really alter what comes to be the general pattern of what the

297
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,340
 command but if what they do is incorporate me a lot of noise of a lot

298
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:13,909
 variability in what my data set is and it was precisely these values ​​are not

299
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,500
 essentially the same, let's say they don't contribute much to the pattern that I

300
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,720
 them what I'm wanting to detect what I want to keep

301
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,880
 So with this what we do is apply a procedure that

302
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,030
 It is called generalization where we go

303
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:35,220
 in principle to identify which are these values ​​that vary and which do not

304
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,830
 sum and we are going to replace it with a generic value so that we

305
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,020
 we can just focus on the skeleton but still retain what

306
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,940
 which is the frequency of the command is not true if I saw it a thousand times I continue

307
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,450
 wanting me to be present a thousand times because that is going to give me some kind of

308
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:59,040
 idea how common in common it is but I want to stick with the structure

309
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,750
 I do not want them to vary that they are considered different then well we apply these

310
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,920
 these replacements and we are left with the structure we see

311
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,950
 down down everything if we move on to the next

312
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,420
 and well as well, there I leave you a cited summary of what the pattern of

313
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,000
 interest with which we are going to stay following a little more in the in the

314
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,410
 processing our idea in principle as we mentioned before is

315
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,730
 be able to reduce a little noise by leaving this large volume of data us

316
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:39,280
 we have and there are specialized people who make people from an operations center

317
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,060
 security or the same people who produce detection content for

318
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,700
 our product we need to do an analysis that allows us to reduce a

319
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,870
 a little bit is this number of data that we have to be able to focus

320
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,810
 in what is really in what is really important and where we

321
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,790
 we can remove material either to identify an attack to detect something

322
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,330
 that is not working properly or to improve our criteria for

323
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:10,270
 detection then we face this as a detection problem

324
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,580
 classroom and vigo psoe of anomalies within the taser which implies

325
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:20,760
 find behavior that deviates from the trend or abnormal behavior

326
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,860
 we remember then that the idea is ultimately to raise your hand when we see

327
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,189
 something weird not what we did then it was good

328
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:36,419
 choose a model that allows us to learn normal behavior and

329
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,350
 when you enter something that deviates from that behavior, half h look at you

330
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:46,158
 something happening this I have not seen before then well after a series of

331
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,990
 experiments that we carry out with our data we decided to use a model like the

332
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:57,210
 that you see on the screen that is called auto encoder these models basically

333
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,159
 are known to be very powerful feature detectors that in

334
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:09,120
 In short, they work by learning to copy the input to the output but not from

335
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,820
 a trivial way like a simple copy but looking for an optimal encoding of

336
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,320
 these data in smaller dimensions

337
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,918
 and learn to decode this representation to reconstruct the data

338
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,750
 original in this way then the model learns

339
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:32,290
 to capture more important files and discard the rest those that only

340
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,080
 include noise so we will have a model like him

341
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,639
 mentioned able to detect patterns the generic patterns that we

342
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,390
 We put together as you see there, this model has two parts, one

343
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:50,010
 encoder part that converts the input into this internal representation of

344
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,960
 smaller dimensions than I mentioned and a decoder that is the generative part

345
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,550
 of the model, which is responsible for translating this internal representation into

346
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,930
 the output look at nothing more than as color data one of the

347
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:08,160
 physical characteristics in addition as that most stands out in the model of his is his

348
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,590
 symmetry is not true I will have from dimensional space

349
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,580
 reduced I will have the same amount of layers and neurons both at the

350
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:23,428
 left as right of me then well continue a little

351
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:26,940
 with him with the theme of the process we start from our of our

352
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,989
 generic patterns become these these patterns to a language

353
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:35,340
 numerical to some vectors of numbers basically because well we don't

354
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,970
 Let's forget that these are mathematical models that you are only going to understand

355
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:44,640
 from numbers we convert that and feed our auto encoder

356
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,980
 we remember that this impute are numerical so I need a metric

357
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,980
 that allows me to measure a similarity between original vector and reconstructed vector and

358
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,160
 for that we use the cosine between both vectors to remember quickie

359
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,660
 the subject of mathematics the closer two vectors are in space

360
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,620
 the closer one is going to be the cost there is between them and the more

361
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,409
 orthogonal lines closer to zero and the more we are passing it to

362
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,430
 second quadrant and the trend will be in the opposite direction of vectors

363
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,920
 we are going to obtain negative values ​​these values ​​that I was telling you is what

364
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,440
 is going to give us an idea of ​​how nality or similarity

365
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,730
 which is exactly what we are looking for since when he covers

366
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,919
 receives an unknown command you will not be able to rebuild it with with a

367
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,790
 high grade precision no then that's what it's going to give us

368
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,000
 to us a certain idea to say good if I can not rebuild it well

369
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,690
 then something happens this clearly no I did not see it before this data this value of

370
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,240
 kitchen we are going to use it to label processed commands

371
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,540
 and it will be good then used by either by the people who told them about the

372
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,139
 software analysts or by people who also develop content

373
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:18,000
 establishing a threshold from which the commands that will be filtered

374
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,440
 are of interest or not then following a little we generate

375
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,440
 as a reference with our data to be generated some plots of how

376
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,599
 we can analyze this evolution of values ​​we see here how it goes

377
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,359
 distributing the similarity values ​​that we assign to the three

378
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:47,119
 is using our already trained model and notice that as we leave that

379
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,679
 we are losing as reality if you want we are also losing

380
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,109
 positivity in these in these is polite so from here we can say

381
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:01,700
 well for example if I were a soft analyst this starting point

382
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,589
 is very important to me because I may not start from the best of a set of

383
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,510
 One billion trace is I say okay I'm going to set a 3 which I can move with

384
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,430
 a certain criterion no but if I know that from a certain value the

385
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,390
 values ​​make me negative so I can say from here are the

386
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,390
 data that generate the most interest to me because they are the ones that least

387
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,049
 see a small clarification that this does not

388
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:33,890
 implies malicious or non-malicious this implies as one not as afterwards

389
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,690
 it will be another type of subsequent analysis to know if it is an attack or if it is

390
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,180
 something or something malicious but in principle what we are detecting is a criterion

391
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,750
 of if we saw it or not we saw it then following a little with the

392
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,819
 topic of the examples assuming we have a composed of more than 11,000 commands

393
00:35:54,819 --> 00:36:00,190
 As a security analyst I will have to invest at best 234 hours in

394
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:07,630
 analyze each of these commands as a whole and possibly more than

395
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,200
 half of these commands are very very common very repetitive questions of the

396
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,299
 operating system if they are I do not know if it turned out that just that day there was a

397
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,310
 series of updates it will be known that many files are generated many are deleted

398
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,759
 files do a lot of queries and so on

399
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,030
 which are things that generally I will not love myself I will not want to lose

400
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:34,210
 time when maybe I have the suspicion that I am being attacked then I go

401
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,340
 to begin to generate a certain amount of lumbar so as to reduce

402
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:45,370
 as far as I can there is this amount of commands that I have until

403
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,460
 get to a point where I say good from here if I have to start

404
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,560
 do a little more detailed analysis, notice that as we go

405
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,570
 by varying these thresholds, I am reducing enough not the

406
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,350
 amount that I keep to analyze in this

407
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:08,380
 first example we are eliminating about 60% of the noise in the example

408
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,420
 next being a little bit more ambitious we are eliminating more than 80

409
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:20,770
 percent of the noise and well if we are even more ambitious we

410
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:26,590
 we concentrate on the minority group I gave you an example and you have to notice that

411
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,550
 we set a certain threshold because we already knew

412
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:36,730
 that we have commands that are effectively malicious then to put a

413
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,210
 a little bit of a test we said well let's see how far we can go

414
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,500
 to be able to compress all that we know is rare and

415
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,060
 Indeed, as you can see there, we find that we have an execution of

416
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,770
 a power sail command that is downloading a file from the knows where

417
00:37:53,770 --> 00:38:00,340
 which coincidentally is called html dot malware and hey with all this kind of

418
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:07,630
 criteria we are going to ultimately give a chance to win or win time

419
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,470
 when we know that we are that you are under attack or when we need

420
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:16,149
 make improvements in our detection techniques perhaps having to

421
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,760
 les corts this can be used as a complement from some others

422
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,340
 criteria is to say good is a wolf and also has

423
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,620
 a criterion of a good low commonality value can be combined

424
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,460
 with different types of analytics we good today too

425
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,650
 we are using other other other methods as well to do different kinds of

426
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,110
 classifications but but well in principle our idea was precisely

427
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:50,000
 was this to be able to minimize the amount of tressis

428
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,369
 To be analyzed for an analyst, that was not a little bit the idea

429
00:38:55,369 --> 00:39:01,220
 then we continue well I quickly present those who

430
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:07,399
 are challenges for us in what that margin learning and analytics data

431
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,850
 security hits sorry data science well it's a relatively

432
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:18,620
 new that companies and people in particular are adapting quite a bit

433
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,960
 little by little and we are faced with situations that are quite

434
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,530
 new and with data also capable that are not fully known to us

435
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,870
 in regard to capable security for example as I mentioned before this

436
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,310
 requires quite a large part of study before for us

437
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,090
 to be able to understand what we are facing as how is this

438
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:48,640
 behavior with this structure and on the other hand the models that we

439
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,970
 we can good get to bring to production

440
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,689
 can become obsolete pretty quickly because you know that

441
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,000
 companies change they change their behaviors have different

442
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,940
 different tasks different activities they perform

443
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:09,180
 then the behaviors vary the data varies and we need

444
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,109
 establish some type of procedure from ree training so that there is no

445
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:18,279
 obsolete the model and becomes useless is not true

446
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,630
 and on the other hand there is also the part from how we explain the results that

447
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:28,119
 are obtained from these miami models we do not need to be able to communicate the

448
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,650
 results to all stakeholders so that everyone understands and

449
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:38,440
 Generally, the one who is going to receive these reports may not be the

450
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,730
 Our own team is maybe someone from sales maybe someone from resources

451
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,020
 humans someone from another team that just doesn't do not take care of this part then

452
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,619
 we need to be able to communicate in a way that is transversal and that everyone can

453
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:55,359
 understand the potential and how to improve the quality of the product the quality of the

454
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,940
 directions as whatever the task

455
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,309
 we're focusing let's say you basically can't go

456
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:06,990
 to tell you look at my model is 95 percent accurate then with ay

457
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,069
 that is what it serves me then we need that you just can

458
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:18,500
 explain these results and finally we have in more finally

459
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,570
 you are adding a new attack vector which is the manipulation of data sets the

460
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,590
 The attacker understands that if certain fields of the data that are

461
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,900
 generated then the model can begin to fail or give results results

462
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:38,210
 erroneous results different from what would be expected, let's not forget that if

463
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,160
 well you can attack all kinds of software these image models what

464
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,859
 pleasant are not exempt from that so we also need a way to

465
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,610
 make our model robust in these situations test it under

466
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:58,160
 different different scenarios is not true different data and think good

467
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,690
 what is our 'false positive' rate and we also train ourselves

468
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:09,040
 in how we prepare our data to precisely reduce that possibility

469
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:15,410
 and well here we come we do not know if there are any questions to any of

470
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,270
 my colleagues want to add something else

471
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:27,370
 Thank you very much for all those who are connected listening and for the space

472
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,690
 again well we are open to questions perfect and flawless and of

473
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:38,440
 turn flawless guys time seem like flawless clock they finished

474
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,570
 I'm just going to tell you my brother for that yes because it is several

475
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:48,770
 questions so well I want to take the opportunity to refer to the

476
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:53,180
 asking if powershell can therefore be used for attacks on links from

477
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:59,240
 the hotel cndh l if in fact it is used a lot I think

478
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,410
 What is power gel, one of the most complex things out there, that's why it clarifies a bit

479
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:08,839
 that if they go to the lan repository of books, it will not appear power is the

480
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:13,940
 common lol bass but if it is in all the others that call them powers the powers

481
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,049
 l as a separate universe is not very complex

482
00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:23,329
 It has a lot of diversity of forms, it must be used that is why I think that a

483
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:30,170
 little and it's like it's a whole issue, part impeccable then they asked well this

484
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,010
 plus a recommendation they were asking because there is someone who mentioned that it is

485
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:38,599
 a data scientist with an imaginary security interest is asking what

486
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:42,589
 projects would be good to do safely using more in learning if you

487
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,828
 Can you give a recommendation? Well, what are we doing?

488
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,700
 at the moment

489
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,280
 Well, precisely what we are doing is not something that I know

490
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,890
 starts and ends not true is a problem quite iterative issue

491
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,069
 This from the subject of the commanders seems like a task to me

492
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:10,450
 quite challenging and interesting because there are many issues to consider

493
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,950
 and particularly what he commented that comes from power shares that if it is

494
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,660
 totally a world apart let's say we can't compare a line

495
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:25,000
 common windows command with a power command be complete because it is

496
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,319
 something is a completely different structure, let's think that in a power line

497
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:32,380
 gel can be run I do not know because they gave the same script in a power line

498
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,490
 sion on all feet is also very

499
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:41,529
 interesting to be able to perhaps do some project that is in charge of

500
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:46,930
 study that to find patterns or to find some kind of club in what

501
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:52,470
 Regarding, taking favor is the bad guy because we

502
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,040
 we see a powers and we say oops it's terrible because the chapis figured powers

503
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,710
 the but in reality it is not necessarily like that although yes in general and good line

504
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,360
 on the other hand there is also a lot to work with network traffic

505
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,900
 there is data everywhere and if we start to study what the

506
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,080
 behavior of a machine there are many things to study so

507
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:22,490
 excellent another question they asked for this

508
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,859
 I wanted to mention that there is a database called mba

509
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:33,380
 I was in game that is public what

510
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,230
 we are losing a little to classify

511
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,730
 some bases once they go by doc are called

512
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:51,250
 hunter two that you can download and play with it enough to have data

513
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:56,829
 so perfect to start testing flawless

514
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:01,420
 Then they asked how they obtain the data is to analyze these classrooms

515
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:06,230
 years good as we mentioned before we have

516
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,210
 obviously our our product is installed on these devices

517
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,359
 devices generate activities the activity is sent to the cloud and we

518
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:19,220
 We consult it from there and from there according to the analysis we want to do

519
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,759
 It is how we are going to do the process of preparing the data, we say it is not

520
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,930
 that it is not that we take it to 100 crude but that we have a series of processes

521
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:32,868
 for applying before being able to do it in short, we have

522
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:36,710
 data sources the data sets are assembled in one step

523
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,540
 following according to what we want to analyze

524
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,730
 excellent and then they ask them what other models

525
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,880
 would be if they can be used to follow a chain

526
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,850
 command that runs in an attack and that's pretty cool as far as

527
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,540
 to time series if you want to do an analysis of

528
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,580
 time series scripts

529
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:05,410
 Obviously data of date data will help you a lot and this that

530
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:10,720
 We mentioned which process calls which other and that the process is called by

531
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:17,339
 what is if time series can make a very good analysis

532
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:24,130
 flawless and then ask if they can mention how different cmd and

533
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,970
 powers within what can be explained in the

534
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:33,118
 time they have but hey are considerable differences

535
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,160
 good as in reality that yes and others are and if you take they have a number of

536
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,710
 different I can't risk how much but

537
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:48,349
 if they are it is very different perhaps there is a limitation in what is a length of

538
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:52,609
 a common command of a command the power and the post that commented to them that it is

539
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:59,180
 you can put scripts within the same command you can put scripts in code a

540
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,348
 two inside there you have a lot of a lot of questions to consider

541
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:10,970
 but yes, that is, my answer is as naive as they are very turn on ok and then they

542
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:15,470
 ask if they consider the possibility of an attacker generating a lot of noise

543
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:20,270
 additional to hide an attack and thus avoid this type of detections something like

544
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:25,509
 as a cover channel to be able to hide that malicious traffic

545
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:29,559
 Of course, yes, that is, that possibility is always there, it is also part of the

546
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:33,849
 chalets that we have is a little bit also the challenge is precisely

547
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:39,909
 to be able to differentiate what is noise from what is, and the attack itself is

548
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:44,709
 This is precisely why we face this type of analytics to

549
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:50,979
 precisely to detect that yes yes yes I imagine that it is a considerable challenge and

550
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:57,040
 how they deal with 'false positives' and that's a never ending task' no

551
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,170
 It is true basically, that is, we generate

552
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,460
 these analytics and these tags and these like it is also validated with a little

553
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,480
 expert knowledge we are not security specialists

554
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,220
 so it is a fairly interdisciplinary work we do

555
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:18,549
 our our part and we have our sets that we know as the results that

556
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,170
 we will wait and in a subsequent validation stage then if

557
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:28,150
 puts in common to tell you look at this is carved as the common but in

558
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:31,840
 in reality it is something quite calm nothing happens

559
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:37,390
 that's how I was saying it's interactive and more interdisciplinary than anything else

560
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:42,790
 precisely because we do not have labels in the data, let's say then

561
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,960
 is how we say unsupervised training then

562
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,870
 take the issue as several instances of validations and tests to stay

563
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,819
 with some flawless concrete

564
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,530
 [Music] well it's one last query because

565
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,890
 They mentioned it in the talk but nevertheless in relation to the king of

566
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,859
 effectiveness that you are achieving which were the rays of

567
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:11,340
 highest effectiveness they achieved and if they were in real cases by in cases

568
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:18,440
 imported simulated is I imagine it refers to the hit rates let's say

569
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,980
 First of all, I will tell you, no, it is not a precise metric that we can

570
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,660
 extract precisely because we lack labels to make these calculations but

571
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:34,210
 but well, precisely we having this data that we know

572
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,650
 To give an example, the product is generally tested with a series

573
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:42,460
 of attacks to know if certain are detected or not detected

574
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:49,119
 behaviors and that these evaluations are obviously data that is preserved and

575
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,420
 for us today imagine now let's say because we know clinical

576
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:59,020
 al asad and then we do if we rely on that say that we have

577
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,640
 had good results not yet we do not go into production so do not

578
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,140
 I can say look in production they are giving a wonder but yes we are

579
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,348
 quite happy with the results we have based on the tests that

580
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:16,750
 We have done perfect and I will take advantage of it because we have a few minutes and the truth

581
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:21,819
 Questions keep coming up so if it's okay, I'll keep reading

582
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:26,079
 I am reading it as they put it in the chat the activation of I see it from the

583
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,799
 windows filtering platform ever saw it to loosen the 100

584
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,060
 that's why I told them if the activation of I see it from the filtering platform

585
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:47,240
 windows if you ever saw it to loosen it always

586
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:53,129
 that's why I told him to read it as it came if we don't move on to the next analysis.

587
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,460
 they also do on linux operating systems or only on operating systems

588
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,730
 windows for now we are in windows ok perfect

589
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:06,109
 well i think that's all i think i don't forget any questions back

590
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:10,730
 guys a thousand thanks impeccable the presentation implied the timing so

591
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:15,589
 well now we make a little pause in a few

592
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:19,219
 Taking advantage of the fact that we have a margin, we are going to start with the next

593
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:24,039
 talk so please don't leave us until the last
