00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:09,799
Good morning, how good it is, I am Carlos Garay de Córdobas with space and in

2
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:15,320
 this time I have to present the following talk by alan levy isr

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,580
 digital bounty hunter making money by reporting vulnerabilities like this

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,720
 What are you talking about? Thank you guys, everything is fine.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,549
 well, very Sunday afternoon I hope you are rested that you do not have

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,809
 He wanted to take a nap, he caught on commenting on Victor's talks

7
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:39,949
 the many spectacular lessons and it's my turn, it's my turn

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,930
 the last talk so a great great responsibility so let's

9
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:52,670
 put it cool and let's do I'll share the presentation and see

10
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,960
 Let's go there tell me if they are seeing it well I know if we start

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,420
 then as well says the title house reward if you are making money

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,040
 reporting vulnerabilities and now let's see what all this means and

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,090
 what is it about first of all my name as well me

14
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,890
 I present as a boy my name is Alan Levy I am the main consult

15
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,960
 write consultant in infinite sindh a company here in Argentina worked with

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,639
 cookie with the time I send you a greeting and I am also a member of the group of

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,920
 online social research from Argentina good and also justly

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,040
 August of endurance in free time, those who know me will also know that

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,680
 I am a curious magician illusionist, no and well, I also undertake others

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,910
 types of things before starting I want to leave you these photos that are of me

21
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,590
 first and I shared in 2011 on the left you will be able to see there that I

22
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,320
 I was doing the look picking quality workshop should still follow

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,520
 doing favors to the workshop and to the right they will see there in it

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,199
 I think it was a Thursday in the after that was done there in the konex I am all

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,110
 only hits and the excuse of purpose this photo

26
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,480
 because nothing if you were never one of ccoo party I recommend that you go I kiss

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,630
 to share and I just did not know absolutely anyone

28
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,829
 and it was an incredible experience, the truth that changed my life

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,170
 literally because after year after year I'm coming I made a lot of friends

30
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,720
 There are many friends and I began to work passionately, nothing of

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,370
 this about computer security and well and on top now I have the honor that the

32
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,570
 economy invites a talk that is, a perfect circle is closed so that

33
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,280
 that more than guests who do not know go to laity unfortunately

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,510
 This year it will do online for reasons of public knowledge but do not stop

35
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:58,850
 to see to be and to join well a little the agenda of today

36
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:06,630
 goes one and that is a frequent questions bagua anti see suspends this platforms

37
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,790
 more known motivation, then we will see how to select a program

38
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,329
 analyze and understand the scope how important it is that we are going to touch is

39
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,380
 more or less does not exceed us due to time issues but we are going to talk about the

40
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,329
 recognition phase which is one of the most important phases and we are going to name

41
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,480
 some methodologies and tools something super important the conception of

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,060
 reports and something that interests us the most is how it is charged when we report

43
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,230
 if we consider a vulnerability valid, we will finally mention one

44
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,609
 community that we have armed here in Argentina and I will give some than others

45
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,370
 details of things that come about

46
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,900
 then first tier which is the back want and there will be many people who are in

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,959
 other side that already knows what saves amount there are many people who may not

48
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,400
 know then we are going to define it and more or less the definition that I like is

49
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,280
 that it is a mechanism by which a company offers rewards to hackers

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,170
 for finding and reporting vulnerabilities in your applications

51
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,289
 infrastructures etc there are several types of programs for

52
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,430
 example are those of programs that are public that anyone can access

53
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,670
 hack or you register on the platform and basically access and voila

54
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,180
 and then there are the private programs that you can only access by

55
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:38,830
 invitation and then let's see how it is to access an invitation and others

56
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,289
 we're going to do this from an answer to questions and answers very quick from

57
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,330
 those of what more than the main doubts that can

58
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,599
 arise obviously because in the end we will answer the doubts that arise from more

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,170
 but some I already have them, as is known, they are the ones that first arise then by

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,910
 example that is a trailer an action suit is a moderator class se

61
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,130
 examine the validity of the report then on this platform are these trailers

62
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,780
 who are the ones who first receive our report our report of the

63
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,000
 vulnerability and they examine if the vulnerability is not duplicated if it is

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,110
 valid and applies to them and they are skopje etcetera etcetera

65
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,530
 who is the activist, there is no activity, they can find him with

66
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,950
 different different names of different back mantis platforms

67
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,479
 but basically it is the end of the public community that shows the

68
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,490
 activities of the hackers basically there are going to show the

69
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,840
 reports that were just published and one can see the techniques they will use

70
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,979
 the other hackers to be able to exploit and find some vulnerabilities and

71
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,300
 other then it is very important to pay attention to the activists and

72
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,380
 read them frequently

73
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,610
 what is reputation and what are most back platforms for

74
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,780
 Huantinos grant reputation every time we find a

75
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:10,130
 valid vulnerability and this reputation are points basically they are points that

76
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,840
 one wins or loses according to the validity of the report he is sending if our

77
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,179
 report was approved means that the vulnerability was validated then we

78
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,020
 they are going to give a certain amount of points it can happen that we are reporting

79
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,880
 something that serves us or that is outside the cob then there they will take away the

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,930
 reputation point basically the size and amount of

81
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,580
 points come in terms of the size of the reward and good according to how critical

82
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,289
 be the vulnerability reported anyway this is calculated by each platform

83
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,740
 in different ways but basically that's what it's about

84
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,780
 how to get invitations to private programs I think is the second question

85
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,039
 that arises when one starts in the bagual the first one that is baluard and second how

86
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,750
 get invitations to private shows well the easiest answer is

87
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,789
 the greater the reputation, the greater the number of programs and private, that is,

88
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:11,870
 more invitations that we will receive first we will not have

89
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,919
 invitations to private programs but then to go reporting valid things

90
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,810
 we are going to gain reputation and that reputation will allow us to access

91
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,380
 invitations to private programs then that is why the

92
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,270
 reputation anyway on platforms like hacker one we have

93
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,219
 some venues to resolve when as soon as we start and with those seven bosses

94
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,240
 we are gaining these points and in the end we will also access

95
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,729
 invitations only to meet some etc

96
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,930
 what is bbb and bbb these are acronyms that did not drive me crazy when

97
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,229
 it started and did not understand how the hand was coming and it was basically bdp en

98
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:58,808
 vulnerability text closure program and basically refers to a program in

99
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:03,389
 where they will not pay vulnerabilities

100
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:10,219
 They're just going to accept the reports and they're obviously going to give you credit for the

101
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:15,619
 hacker but they will not pay anything and then there are the bp are the anti bums

102
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:19,159
 programs that are conventional where they offer rewards for

103
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:25,500
 reported vulnerabilities who visited know to start good

104
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,390
 the truth is that this is a super broad topic obviously this is not only

105
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,669
 a bagua andy theme this is some general computer security so

106
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:44,250
 I recommend starting with the 'top ten' logos obviously if it is as a key

107
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,100
 web web security academy de by schwager of reports this that he said about the

108
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,040
 feasibility of other hackers and follow the bagua hashtag

109
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,599
 tips on twitter is very useful because well there are many hackers share

110
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,250
 tips for one diverse péndex this is a whole discussion that even recently

111
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,740
 when I had the deco or marathon there was a panel where it was discussed and others is a

112
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,960
 I have to give for a while I do both work as a pen tester but in

113
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,680
 my free time silly quant and I think the two things are totally compatible

114
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,180
 and I do not think that one thing has to replace the other but that there are two

115
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,650
 Completely different things, having said this, we are going to differentiate the pendex

116
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:38,339
 as a project of a fixed duration the payment is agreed by the project

117
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,800
 reports all kinds of

118
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,579
 vulnerabilities from the most critical to later from the forgiveness from the

119
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:49,019
 least critical to the most critical, that is, from things that could be

120
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,569
 potential vulnerabilities to things that are actual vulnerabilities

121
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:59,099
 generally there are testing schedules sometimes sometimes the company that hires

122
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,220
 puts a schedule where the tests can be done and on the side of endurance

123
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,069
 and we can find that there is no preset duration or contracts

124
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:16,110
 pre-established nor anything nor schedules are not paid for results unlike

125
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,560
 pentes this is paid only for results to say that you can not

126
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,829
 invest 100 hours but if you did not find a vulnerability you will not receive a

127
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:26,310
 weight report of vulnerabilities with impact

128
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,160
 demonstrable we can report assumptions or hypothetical cases we must demonstrate

129
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,430
 vulnerability demonstrate the impact and good there are policies of

130
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,010
 allocate them that we have to tie that are precisely from the scouts and the

131
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,270
 policies that put each program the bridge is good precisely in

132
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:53,240
 predefined mode we have what is white hart for white world great box or

133
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,750
 black box and good is the most popular platforms in the world of the bum

134
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:06,140
 anti in the truth that every day more come out there are many so that I decided on

135
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,770
 put only some perhaps the best known to us are hardware

136
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,480
 background and viti and it's wefaq and we have last and puss the boots code

137
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,710
 I want to make a special mention for bosco because it is the only one at least the

138
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,210
 The only one I know is a Latin American Chilean Trees code

139
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:32,600
 and well this one is good although the software and the

140
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,290
 much lower rewards in money compared to the other platforms

141
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,469
 there is also much less competition from other hackers so maybe

142
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,460
 To start, it is a good starting point to start with a platform like

143
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,880
 wins out good motivation we have to have one

144
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,560
 motivation to enter this fabulous world and be able to start

145
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,390
 observe a tris and so on and basically they immediately come to mind

146
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,590
 two types of motivations that a person can have that are the

147
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:11,230
 knowledge learning because one is going to have to read and learn a lot

148
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,250
 in order to exploit a vulnerability first find it and then

149
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,700
 exploiting them that makes one have to investigate

150
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,820
 on many technologies on different types of products and the truth is that

151
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,120
 one in the process is learning a lot that is not true on the one hand and

152
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,290
 on the other hand we cannot be hypocrites and we have to say what the

153
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,760
 another motivation is also money because it is not wrong to want to earn money and

154
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,590
 it is a more than valid motivation so it is there

155
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:51,190
 but besides everything if I like to be this phrase how good if one chose a

156
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,840
 work that you are not passionate about yet no then you will not work another day no

157
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,170
 you want steve jobs basically it's all the same no

158
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:08,010
 you do pentes do bang bang computer security tips and you still do not have it

159
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,960
 that you will be passionate because if you are not passionate if you only focus on money you will not

160
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,610
 going to get good results I think the main motivation has to

161
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,560
 be precisely the passion and wanting to know how things work and the

162
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,890
 learning money is a consequence that will come for everything

163
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,160
 this

164
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,269
 and let's talk well about how much we talk because we are talking about money can

165
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:37,980
 make money on what and how much are we talking about well I'm going to put some

166
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,480
 examples of the hacker one platform of some public programs of the

167
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,100
 rewards that they offer there is a table of rewards and for example this we

168
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,800
 offers the vulnerabilities in the lou 150 dollars we are talking about dollars

169
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,410
 Americans even the most critical who pay five thousand dollars here is another

170
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,930
 example where the minimum is paid 50 and the critical 12 thousand 500 notice that there is

171
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,079
 a big difference here is another where the minimum 100 and the

172
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,460
 maximum 4000 here is another where the minimum 50 and the

173
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,160
 maximum 2000 and finally we can find precisely hacker one has his

174
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,600
 own for a day within your own platform where you have a very

175
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,120
 big and notice that he even pays up to 15 thousand dollars facebook

176
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,790
 lump has its bound and if the largest compresses are the ones that reward the most

177
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,810
 offer but vulnerabilities are also difficult to find in these

178
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,199
 companies is not so easy we could make a

179
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,870
 kind of grabbing well where the more they offer us, the harder it is to find a

180
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,760
 vulnerability you could not get to say something like that

181
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,350
 select a good program the importance of knowing what we have

182
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,240
 what to set when selecting a program we sign up we sign up

183
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,250
 a platform of vantis and now what do we do to where we ran

184
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,050
 well, I would tell you to look at first differential public programs

185
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,010
 private if you just start up, it is most likely that you do not have programs

186
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,800
 private so they are going to have to imply receiving if through a program

187
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,469
 public that we are going to have to say if they want to do something web something wire by gol

188
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,900
 of reid eject even there is hardware or they will have to say based on their

189
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,390
 knowledge or what they want to learn what they want to do

190
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,670
 they will have to say if they are going to use a new or old program there

191
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,699
 programs that have had their bounty program there for many years and

192
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,140
 some newly released programs are continually releasing new ones

193
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,740
 programs then you're going to have to ask yourselves what

194
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,940
 it is advisable to enroll in a new program where everyone will go

195
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,580
 running to hit that program or I should go to a company that makes five

196
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,260
 years that you have a bounty program and it is there I have seen good it is two

197
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,410
 questions that one has to go asking and analyzing the advantages and

198
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,620
 disadvantages

199
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,850
 if he pays bounty and if he does not pay we also have to decide that and with the advantage

200
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,490
 to go for a program where they do not pay baptize well they will not pay us bounty

201
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,090
 but they are going to give us a lot of reputation points in return and you say

202
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,680
 good but with the reputation points that I do I want money good but no

203
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,030
 let's forget the reputation points are used to later be invited to

204
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,810
 private programs and private programs are supposed to be much less crowded

205
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:45,280
 spending time then maybe a good strategy when a resin

206
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,260
 starts is to go for the programs that do not pay money to just obtain

207
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,350
 reputation points and as they do not pay money there will also be less

208
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,910
 competition then perhaps it is a good strategy I leave it to you so that

209
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,990
 think is also a good idea is to analyze in

210
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,609
 the program the totals of the gloves that have been paid since the program

211
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,500
 was launched and the average total bounty that they have been paying because

212
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,750
 they may pay the critical 5,000 dollars and the blogs pay them 100

213
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,380
 dollars but the mail petro locution program means what others have

214
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:26,049
 paid is the 6,300 dollars so we know that they are only

215
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,730
 reporting low and medium vulnerabilities but not many people

216
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,630
 reporting critical vulnerabilities then well that's already giving us the

217
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,179
 indications about the security of the platform or the program that we are

218
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:45,330
 analyzing us time to trail is a good thing for

219
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,449
 note that basically refers to time to the number of hours or days that

220
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,789
 take time to give our bone to validate our report from the day that since

221
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:02,279
 the moment we send it, how long the platform will take to tell us and

222
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:07,080
 the report is valid or invalid and time its resolution is basically what

223
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,559
 indicates to the word is the time it takes to resolve the vulnerability or

224
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,100
 once it was validated that they gave us the tri next is the time that

225
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,980
 it takes the program to solve and say ready, it's ready, ready the

226
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,970
 vulnerable and then obviously into something no less

227
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,070
 It is important to see the cast or not and we are going to talk about the scop but it is super

228
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,350
 It is important to analyze the coc and the previous knowledge that each one has

229
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,219
 because if I have a lot of knowledge in what good web I will lean towards

230
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,240
 that and I will not go to see something else then knowledge

231
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,020
 prior to having each one, it will greatly influence the program that

232
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,950
 each said analysis and understanding of alcohol and

233
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,970
 This is very important because it can cause us to lose points or lose

234
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:05,620
 time which would be worse not then for example we could see domains and their

235
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,110
 domains that are in this and maybe we could see a dot asterisk

236
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,340
 domain.com and we love to see the 'wild cards' that are the

237
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,629
 asterisks in front of the domain because it means that any subdomain

238
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:24,279
 that is in that domain will enter the code so we like that because not

239
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:30,549
 limits us basically tells us in the dotcom exam is the domain and everything

240
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:33,999
 that you find that they are in your domains that point here they are

241
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:40,169
 accepted and we like that a lot, you can find that there are also the

242
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:45,809
 mobile apps earlier today there was a very interesting talk about

243
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:52,210
 precisely to applications in diabetes and the truth is that it is a good niche to hit it

244
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,150
 It helps applications once because as many people experience playing games

245
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,049
 getting into generating the android world but we can't forget about ios there

246
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:07,030
 very few people making bounty senators I think would be a good tip to

247
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,490
 not to rule out we cannot find that there are ranges of the network in

248
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:19,030
 plan also not only everything is about web or mobile applications and well

249
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,660
 You have to pay close attention to what Scott's out of the limitations of the

250
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,809
 program, for example, something very common is to find vulnerabilities that

251
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:35,590
 programs do not accept and they could be safe ekis ekis ekis cts or

252
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,350
 cross sport for fair and in the wing log out or social distributed techniques

253
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,699
 with company employees or those kinds of vulnerabilities that they don't

254
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,780
 want to receive and therefore explicitly state in their policies that

255
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,710
 those practices and vulnerabilities are outside the ico

256
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,779
 and an example of a subdomain outside cop will not find that in a certain

257
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,230
 part they will say their domain point company contact with this they are out

258
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,120
 of the code then it may be that there is a wild-card material point company

259
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,039
 dotcom and below clarify everything is fine just like the dotcom company

260
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,539
 but your dotcom company domain and we are not going to include it then it is very

261
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,908
 important to read companys forum

262
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:25,279
 here are some examples to understand this is the platform with

263
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:32,659
 a part of the scout of grammer live.com here we are going to see what they accept for

264
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:38,539
 point institution domains grammar live.com accept vulnerabilities up to

265
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:43,970
 says the column that we see in the crosses and that is up to what they accept and

266
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,820
 On the other hand, if they pay or not, then how can we see the first three cases?

267
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,210
 accept even vulnerable critical vulnerabilities which you want

268
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,440
 say that all kinds of vulnerability from the lowest to the most critical

269
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,100
 they will then accept and consequently as we see in the column at

270
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:07,820
 side they are going to pay it but look at case number 4 they are going to accept

271
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,799
 even what you mean millions for reporting something critical and in fact they

272
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,129
 they accept critical things notice that there were even clear but those critical things

273
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,209
 They are going to pay them like lou, it is worth saying that if in the table

274
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:29,210
 of rewards the critical that pay 5000 and the lobe pay 100 in that domain

275
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,399
 particular that they are talking there for more than one report something like a rc

276
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:39,469
 They are going to pay it equal to 100 or low why because well that is their policy and

277
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:46,940
 one is accepting this contract at the time of beginning to work with them and

278
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,169
 You can also find this other in this one for example from the high soma too

279
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:58,190
 our public program where you can see that these applications are are

280
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,080
 in scouts and they do not pay, notice that the second column says that they are not is not

281
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,389
 ineligible cannot be paid, that is, it is not paid but who accepts them are not accepted

282
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:15,440
 not all as a critic and there is a very interesting item that was added that killed as

283
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,029
 several companies that if there is an item that you are in a vulnerability

284
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:24,140
 in something that is not put in the score of them that do not have it

285
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,870
 explicitly commented you can still report this vulnerability

286
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,739
 and the company that you are going to take and then analyze and then you are going to tell the hacker

287
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,990
 if it applies for a reward or it applies for points perhaps or if it does not apply

288
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,910
 for nothing in case it does not apply at all the company will not sanction you no

289
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,690
 it will close the report and you will not lose reputation points like

290
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,180
 it would happen normally but on the contrary they will let you close the

291
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,160
 report yourself which makes you do not lose these reputation points with

292
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,790
 this the company is more transparent and as it just accepts that the sheet

293
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,540
 that they report bugs because you are interested in knowing then there are

294
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,159
 something that they forgot to put in stock and they are also interested in knowing if

295
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,680
 have super important reconnaissance phase vulnerabilities

296
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,610
 the better this phase the more information we collect

297
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,629
 in rich recognition passes more likely to be successful we go

298
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,440
 to have to find a vulnerability and these phases where

299
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,610
 we are going to use for different applications to search for example their

300
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:41,899
 domains open ports and services directories files clicks on sources

301
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:48,140
 open using techniques of or without apis web services and others it is

302
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,200
 precisely to collect the greatest amount of information from our

303
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,300
 objective to end after classifying it and being able to see where we can find a

304
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,720
 vulnerability

305
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,120
 for what is rich there are no hackers who create a methodology each one means that

306
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,100
 has its methodology the big six are haddix

307
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,949
 He is a hacker who is closely linked to what the anti bum is and has written a

308
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,080
 methodology that the java devised for version 3 was recently going to launch the

309
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,850
 version 4 but finally could not attend an event that was held in

310
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,730
 lainez that surely next month or so it won't take long

311
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:37,490
 more is going to launch version 4 but I highly recommend looking for it in

312
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,080
 youtube and well and study it, notice that it is a video that lasts more than an hour.

313
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,879
 to see the techniques that this person uses as he uses them and everything is

314
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,840
 the record phase is also targeted so it is super important to me that

315
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,760
 You do not give them a recommendation, nothing else is necessary 6 but at the foot of the

316
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,610
 lyrics but understanding and seeing how those who already know work is I think a good

317
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,600
 kick off and then the tools which tools we use

318
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,709
 well the truth that millions of tools are still coming out just

319
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,150
 if new tools are coming out but there are some that one cannot ignore

320
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:21,380
 for logical reasons I put the boot suite on the left and I have the

321
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,740
 lucky to use the professional version but if not with the version

322
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,460
 chrome mini that would be fine too as to boot my advice is

323
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,990
 that when they grab some silver from the gloves, the first thing they do is invest

324
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,330
 in a work suite license and believe me it is a tool that will give you

325
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,020
 many satisfactions and it will simplify your life and on the other hand

326
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,040
 I have point of tools that are scripts or

327
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,930
 tools programmed in python which the ones I put there are a bit

328
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,760
 fair ministers but there are many and it was not like that finder 'to look for their

329
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,650
 Test hachette domains to see if you have started web services from

330
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:06,770
 true the one that fixes the urls that are that they were married in the apache web

331
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:13,580
 and aquatron to take pictures of the screenshots to the wings to the pages that

332
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,110
 do not have a secret external entity is more is carbon I think it is not necessary

333
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,639
 introduce us to more art blocks just to work a little

334
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,950
 parameters and the search to migrate mauro soria to dig a little in the

335
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,169
 directories and see if we find directories and files

336
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:37,960
 and if we are a little light if they are lazy there is no we do not like having to

337
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,369
 throw all of this separately and click on each tool and have to

338
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:48,779
 organize everything we can access this repository lazy corner is made by

339
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:54,639
 a hacker calling nam sec who has a tweet about about computer security

340
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:59,199
 and about something anti and what he did was a very nice script where from behind

341
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,919
 thrown two titles and many others more and basically it is good to stretch it as

342
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,989
 it says there with less than the domain and not much more my recommendation is that yes

343
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:16,690
 They are in the kitchen starting and do not give much importance to this because

344
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,169
 it is precisely about learning and if you are going to go to a script like this

345
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:25,119
 that automatically does everything for you, you will be missing the most

346
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,769
 nice that is learning so I have the status maybe even one for

347
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:34,539
 see how it works from behind what are you throwing in what way throwing them but my

348
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:39,320
 advice is that we do it again mein maps is a good way to

349
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,270
 organize ourselves and have a mental map to see what is missing

350
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:49,280
 where we can continue our recognition phase this is a main map

351
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,660
 what did juan do who is part of our community of bacchus anti singer of

352
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,250
 Argentina that later I will mention to you there read a kind of zoom where

353
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:03,320
 you can see that this does not follow a flow but is a mind map is a help

354
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,090
 memory of tools that we can pull for the different things we want

355
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,399
 do and there is a way where how each tool is executed and then

356
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,500
 we have the workflows that these have information where one starts by

357
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,330
 a target and then it reaches the good domain then it starts looking for its

358
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,500
 domains and you already have the good subdomains you can search for virtual games

359
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,440
 c3 packages as this workflow just takes you through the

360
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,970
 different stages there are many this is only an example I did not put the

361
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,510
 sources because unfortunately I don't remember where I got it but how

362
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,220
 I say there is a lot of workflow and well it's good to go analyzing the

363
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,290
 several here I also leave a checklist

364
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:55,889
 that good and make the mind thank you very much and it is great to create me

365
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,210
 In the main arm for me to also organize it a little with my work

366
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,770
 daily and then it seemed appropriate to share it with the community so there

367
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:09,660
 is my repository I keep it updated as I can and

368
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,340
 just as the word says it is a checklist to see that we do not

369
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,590
 we have forgotten to do something that is interesting in this phase of

370
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,010
 rich you don't wanna get rich use gunsan

371
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,570
 you want to go directly to withdrawals and look for vulnerabilities

372
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,780
 you want to do this good the consequence of doing this

373
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:39,420
 always or in a large percentage it will be to obtain duplicates in the US that is

374
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,920
 vulnerabilities that do not apply and they will deduct points from us and in the best of

375
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,000
 the cases will close news vulnerabilities

376
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,450
 dukes anywhere and we do not want duplicates tips I recommend using it for

377
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,040
 everything that is rich from a virtual private server that is a pps of this

378
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,290
 way we have many advantages you do not expose clips to a shaft or it will give you

379
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,700
 much more speed is what one can have a home connection going to

380
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,240
 be a 100% dedicated environment for which one wants in this case to do

381
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,740
 bounty then we do not put our hardware or anything we can leave the

382
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,440
 machine powered up in the cloud and working all day every day

383
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,280
 of the year we do not have to leave our computer connected with the rhythm of

384
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,680
 Press the light hard or the internet is cut off and the work is lost and well

385
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,030
 If you want, I'll leave you a coupon for $ 100 to spend on the platform.

386
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,740
 digital the option is the one I choose to have my bps you have plans from 5

387
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,520
 dollars a month I leave them there in case you are interested

388
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,100
 preparation of a good report is super important because suppose what already

389
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:56,020
 we find a vulnerability and then now we have to move on to

390
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,070
 inform the company what we found and note that this is

391
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,639
 extremely important because we have to be able to transmit what

392
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,290
 I just found the company because there is going to be someone on the other side who does not

393
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,060
 knows what we did and we have to give it the right steps and

394
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,169
 necessary to be able to reproduce exactly what we have just found

395
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,440
 then we have to be very clear and concise to create another person what

396
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,430
 can reproduce and in which the three are fixed that we said are this

397
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,170
 kind of moderators and in giving means that they will first find

398
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,400
 our report and they will validate it then what is it that they fix well

399
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,950
 reports a quality report we can say that it will have a clear title in

400
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,220
 the title we can refer directly to the vulnerability

401
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,190
 We find it a summary of the finding that is very clear and concise in 23 regions

402
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,600
 that what we found the steps for reproduction I think

403
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,379
 it is something vital that cannot be missing in any quality report

404
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,540
 just access the first step access against the user to this functionality

405
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,610
 second step captures the river with a proxy third step modifies the beat

406
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:14,119
 costs to the parameter such another well step by step well detailed

407
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:20,599
 proofs of concept just if we have to give a piece of code or a

408
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:24,678
 fragment of a writing just whatever it is that comes to mind that contributes

409
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,899
 I think a proof of concept is super important video screenshots

410
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:35,149
 They serve as proofs of concept and they contribute a lot to an image worth more

411
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:40,819
 than a thousand words and I think it fully applies and a suggested solution is not

412
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:49,069
 something that is super unnecessary but in my view it is something nice something that is not

413
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,849
 we can forget that on the other side there is a person just like us who

414
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:57,039
 instead of attacking he will be defending so to speak and he has to

415
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,329
 suggest to your development team and others a solution and I think putting a

416
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:08,449
 Suggested solution I think it will speak well of us and I was going to enter that

417
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:12,918
 finally we know what we are doing and well nothing to them

418
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:18,799
 I recommend putting a suggested solution and well it is an impact to demonstrate the

419
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,080
 impact always what is spoken then a summary of the impact is I think it is

420
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,159
 good for telling the company with this vulnerability

421
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:35,119
 the company could lose x amount of money as the

422
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,020
 licenses their dental products in point and waha does it is to demonstrate a

423
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,759
 impact that the person who receives it immediately realizes the impact that

424
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,918
 can produce this vulnerability is a way to open the eyes of the

425
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,690
 to be on the other side and well, everything that you can think of is good

426
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,500
 life what does our life not want

427
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,090
 well they don't want a lot of kinds of things but they basically don't want this

428
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:07,610
 This is a report of a user who was clearly shot from the of the

429
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:14,600
 hacker platform one look at it reported a big x ss vulnerability

430
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:21,049
 In other words, everything half rare ended up bathed and notice that what it said i play please

431
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:28,280
 me and miami seek amy money or axis, nobody is interested in knowing your problems

432
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,869
 You are not going to be begging for money, they will pay you only if

433
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:38,750
 appropriate and these types of reports are generally not going to reach any

434
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:45,120
 good port and the only thing they are going to do is put the person who

435
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,180
 wants to talk so bring them to them they don't want this

436
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,940
 If you want to know more about what you want and what you don't want a

437
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:57,630
 bring I recommend a youtube channel that is mine that precisely

438
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,380
 later I'm going to talk a little about that I have a video called the secrets

439
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:08,319
 from a hardware trailer where gonza was interviewed by a friend who extracts

440
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:13,180
 yesterday and has works as a translator in hacker one for one for a program

441
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,640
 and well and there we were talking a lot and the

442
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,549
 talk and on the left side they have another video with some friends with jaime dragon

443
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:31,359
 chat and antonio the three of us were talking for the crown with one with whom

444
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,710
 did I think it was last month to raise money for the red cross as well as

445
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:41,260
 I did it secular parties it was for Spain and a back want forum and where also

446
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,820
 we talked and saw several tips about things that may lead you to interest so

447
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:52,720
 that is the link to antonio's channel and you can enter and watch the video there

448
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,250
 well getting almost to the last part which is the interesting thing then ok and how

449
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:05,670
 These are charged from the bounty because I did a good recognition phase

450
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:12,430
 I found a lot of information about the company I started to analyze I found the

451
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:17,049
 vulnerability I could exploit so I made a super report

452
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,090
 interesting very clear very concise I sent it with its reproduction step

453
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,860
 I grab the trailer the 3rd said see this is a valid report it is not a duplicate no

454
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:32,110
 it is nothing is valid put a civility said that it is critical that it is mean that

455
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:37,870
 balance whatever and finally the company comes says congratulations

456
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,980
 we were able to validate your vulnerability we are working for them to spend a few

457
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,390
 days there is again a concept of part the company the company corrects the

458
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,259
 vulnerability and they tell us very well congratulations you won

459
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,650
 the reward and they tell you how many blocks it pays

460
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,809
 and then how do you charge well basically there are two common actors in

461
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:03,400
 almost all platforms that are bitcoin on the one hand and paypal on the other

462
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,380
 we can charge our under our go by bitcoins and by paypal and from

463
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,160
 there some subas actors emerge, so to speak, which are for example

464
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:20,828
 ripio prex local cloud bitcoins air el tien and many other platforms

465
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:25,180
 here I put some of the means because we are going to have the money so much

466
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,720
 in tweet as as cover but we are going to have to get that money from some

467
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,399
 way so we want to remove it and not leave it here the same these are some of

468
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,720
 the solutions that exist in the market there are many others as we know

469
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,259
 here in Argentina there are some limitations with what the dollar is and

470
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,460
 more so well I'll give you a little research TV but I don't know

471
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,029
 worry so much about this, first you have to worry about finding the

472
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,650
 vulnerabilities and make them valid

473
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:59,140
 finally I leave you then the [ __ ] night this that means yes that

474
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,509
 they are the hacking night good to hakim night they were born at the end of last year

475
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:09,430
 basically it is a tweet that I make weekly there in tweets tv point

476
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:15,730
 wizard bars where we talk about topics related to computer security

477
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,590
 most of the time they are beichuán tip themes but there are times like

478
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:26,050
 last week ruth and valen visited us where they told us about

479
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,760
 head hunting and it was not a motto specifically to go glove and lose

480
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,380
 a very interesting topic that the community liked so much so I invite you to be

481
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,330
 tuned in and follow me around and well if you are interested you will be able to see

482
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:45,310
 what are we talking about the previous emissions as you know in

483
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:50,230
 tweets do not delete tweets I think every 14 days the videos so they can find

484
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,090
 previous broadcasts on my youtube channel

485
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:59,460
 and well, basically that's what it's about jaquimeyes everyone is

486
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,870
 invited to participate I am a kind of presenter on the days that we do not have

487
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:10,440
 live guests it is me who shows something obviously but as always

488
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,670
 I say and repeat it hakim night is an open space for the community in

489
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:19,380
 where everyone who wants to show something and share something to the community lets me know

490
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,720
 contact me and the space is just for us to do it

491
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,470
 Among all no one you stay points great this is one of the topics that

492
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,490
 we were playing lately for example we talked about the organizers by

493
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:39,578
 forges and sometimes everything like the issues of specific vulnerabilities

494
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:42,940
 and the wise of terms go want and for people just starting out

495
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,340
 unfairly wants to know about some terms that are not understood

496
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,240
 we talked about how to make money by automating processes in which

497
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,669
 Stamina and well just what I was telling you about last week of triage

498
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,500
 hunting and we also had other talks from other super interesting girls denis

499
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,420
 and Cecilia talking about hardware hacking and nothing else I invite you to yes

500
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,060
 They are interested in looking for it and they are all published and finally talk to them about

501
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,320
 the community we have created a community called the anti-Argentine corps the

502
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,580
 you can search in telegram this community generally we the group that

503
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:26,430
 we have in telegram it is private but I decided to open it for today so if they are

504
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,600
 watching they can search among the great anti-Argentine ship they can join the group and

505
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,650
 well we are all for him all here if you are going to see this video

506
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,400
 recorded surely and look for bhagwan that Argentina will not find it but

507
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,030
 They write to me on twitter and we have no problem adding them

508
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:46,390
 we simply keep the group as private closed for what

509
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:50,940
 I have nothing more or less control of who is there else

510
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,589
 of this community and together with my dear family companion I send her a kiss

511
00:41:55,589 --> 00:42:01,319
 huge we have organized some events for example in January we organized a

512
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:07,770
 event next to hacker one where 60 hackers and in real time hitting him

513
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:13,589
 together to the same and the same program with very good and starbucks that provided

514
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:18,029
 some gifts and some prizes was more very interesting a few were made

515
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:22,770
 thousands of dollars as a reward that several winners took there there was a

516
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:30,450
 award to the best hacker and charcoal pulse which backpacks stickers good until

517
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:36,470
 starbucks in addition to putting them baptized put a gift cards to drink coffee

518
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:41,868
 we contacted there is a very nice space in word obelisk where we feel very

519
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:46,970
 comfortable and we had a super great lunch on the terrace.

520
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,899
 we had an incredible time the idea was to redo some of

521
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:57,890
 these events throughout this year no one had kobe 19 so

522
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,848
 obviously the face-to-face events that we had planned to do throughout the

523
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:06,770
 year were temporarily suspended but I can tell you that we are

524
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,750
 thinking of doing something online so be connected that surely within

525
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,869
 of little and more news we are trying to give you a little

526
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:20,980
 this young woman is one of the photos we take

527
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,690
 some go well and two later we went we did an after good that's what

528
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,290
 nice of the face-to-face events do all the online events are great

529
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:34,450
 but face-to-face events have this that a wine is great

530
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,609
 people from the pampas came people from the sea silver came to people from rosario people came

531
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,180
 from uruguay the uruguay team in this photo had both had to go

532
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,100
 precisely so as not to miss the ship back but this that was armed with this

533
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,180
 community is to build a very nice community of people with all levels of

534
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,730
 knowledge and eager to share and learn among all that I think

535
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,750
 what is fundamental and what stands out in this community that today we are more than 200

536
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:06,070
 people in their Argentinean masters but there are also people who are not from

537
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,910
 Argentina is not a limitation so know that if you are from other countries and

538
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:14,220
 they also want to add they can be added without any problem

539
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:19,830
 people or things or hashtags some hashtag that should follow good to them

540
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:26,098
 I recommend the want factor and tips on twitter and here are some people and what

541
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,790
 somehow have some major influence on what is going glove and

542
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:36,359
 computer security in general and there are thousands of people could not put to

543
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:43,710
 all in one slide but I decided to make a selection of some tones does not have some

544
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:50,190
 you contribute some tools some incredible tools 'insiders' and have more some

545
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:55,230
 terrific tutorial videos jason holdings as he told them with with

546
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:00,690
 their hamsik methodologies that have their tweets that also shows things very

547
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:07,080
 interesting everything that is a bit a summary being an albino with his techniques

548
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,420
 impressive well nothing I leave you there in your twitters do not forget to follow them

549
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,060
 because the truth is that they are people who contribute a lot to the community

550
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:23,900
 And as yoda says, don't try it, no yes, or if you're going to do it, I'll do it or not

551
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,180
 do but do not try to get into it fully it is important to be determined to

552
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,890
 do it and well put passion into what we are going to do you always have to do the

553
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:39,410
 things with passion and as I said at the beginning the purpose is going to be to learn

554
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,490
 and being connected in community and money is going to be something that a

555
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:50,069
 consequence that will come alone well thank you very much and open to

556
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:56,280
 questions that can answer very good the truth magician

557
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:03,760
 I have two cycles without further question is reported things that

558
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,700
 They say they don't apply and they don't pay and then I see that the rule says it's possible

559
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:16,180
 that somewhere keep a change and that although it does not work

560
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,359
 are things that one will never never know not the background of faith but still believe

561
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,930
 many doubts the truth that does not believe are the majority platforms at least

562
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,950
 I know that they are extremely serious and handle things in a super way

563
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:36,308
 professional anyway if one believes that one reported something and they did not take it

564
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:41,050
 as valid and you are convinced that this vulnerability is valid can open a

565
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,050
 kind of mediation, for example in urban osaka you can ask us for a

566
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:49,210
 mediation has happened to me where a mediation has been opened and I have won it

567
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:53,890
 because well finally the other side are human beings and all human beings

568
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,118
 we were wrong in his whole being that maybe it was wrong and speaking one goes

569
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,950
 understanding the same I recommend if one is 100% sure that what is reported

570
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:09,859
 It is valid then to ask for a mediation we have there a house work team

571
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,270
 rewards or you usually work individually there are many people who work

572
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,320
 as a team and in fact there are many platforms that are accepting this from

573
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:25,250
 work as a team and the platform proposes the division of social bounty that

574
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:30,770
 you can invite your partner to the report and automatically that

575
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:35,660
 reward or it will be divided and I think that one can choose the amount is the

576
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,270
 percentage give him 20% and give me the remaining 80% because good is the

577
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:45,920
 decision we made and well I think that more and more is pointing to that and

578
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,930
 I also believe that there is an intention of at least in hacker one to do something something

579
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,870
 similar but with the reputation points that can also be divided

580
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:58,339
 between the different members it has its advantages and disadvantages I believe

581
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,850
 that it is very advantageous to work in a team one as one goes by tension

582
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:06,690
 so i only recommend now i have 13 what if one finds

583
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,730
 a bar that at the level of an experience level one detects that it is critical

584
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,240
 but the company does not want to admit that it is a vulnerability that can be done

585
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,649
 I think there is more or less the issue of migration and if it is more or less what

586
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,340
 we talked before it is a little mediation for that are the trailers of each

587
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:29,220
 platform then well we will have to talk to them and explain and give them

588
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,330
 our reasons why we believe that the criticality of the

589
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:37,560
 vulnerability is higher than what they are finally proposing the

590
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,960
 The program will have the last word, they are the ones who pay and that's it, but everyone

591
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,640
 we have tools to fight it and demonstrate the impact that

592
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,089
 it's finally that's what it's all about with all of us the more we can demonstrate the

593
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:55,710
 impact of a vulnerability, the more likely we are that the

594
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,280
 criticality also rises sometimes as active banks are made or it does so in a

595
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,839
 station no good there is everything the truth there is

596
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:11,279
 companies that do not have a problem where they are made in their environments

597
00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:17,099
 productive there are many times that in the policies they tell you please don't throw them away

598
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:21,150
 you have too limited your quantity of rich is per second to 6 x quantity

599
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:27,059
 rich is per second or they ask you this kind of thing and they ask you to include some

600
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:30,839
 special header in requests to be able to identify where they are from

601
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:35,730
 coming on request or they ask you to register on their platform with an alias

602
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,539
 that provides for example the hacker platform want you offers you a guide to

603
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:43,200
 your mail then happy that way they can identify the users

604
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,578
 who are doing this work and maintaining many other platforms

605
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:53,249
 that publish a place with a statistics or testing area for the

606
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:57,259
 tests and good act depends on each company

607
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:07,560
 We can see it says we have some blue for water amount in windows I would believe that

608
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:15,210
 that is more oriented to the blue which is used for well wood suite is

609
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:22,200
 cross-platform so I think the answer blames fine having a report of

610
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:28,080
 example to share I have there are a lot of reports examples

611
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,120
 I would recommend as I said in the talk to look at the activists

612
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,990
 activists all the reports that were made public so read

613
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:42,120
 those reports are going to find out which are the best written reports that

614
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:47,370
 others so the law to go down that path well what characteristics should

615
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:52,950
 have one you ask me to do the lazy anti ram terabyte etc. I am

616
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:58,560
 driving with the minimum that I think is a gig of ram he was wrong 112 gig of

617
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:04,830
 ram is not much more than that, if I'm not wrong about the disk, it has 50 gigabytes.

618
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,799
 something very simple because the tools occupy us too much

619
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,060
 space we all we want is a machine is turned on with a

620
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,320
 good connection and nothing else so with the minimum option that it offers for example

621
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,010
 type the option there are a lot of times but with minimal action chests in them

622
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:24,240
 it's going super well what can be done wagon you knowing

623
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,968
 little programming knowing a little programming

624
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:31,059
 obviously I do not consider myself the programmer I am studying the car at

625
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:35,140
 who take more advantage of health also people ute n I am just learning

626
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,519
 programming obviously knowing programming is going to nurture one on the

627
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,118
 knowledge that we have and it will give us more tools but it is not something

628
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,439
 It is essential to know the programming more and that I encourage you to learn try

629
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:50,308
 cen but it's still metal

630
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:57,240
 if I get bounty in a virtual machine it is the same as having a pc with

631
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,200
 cali on linux

632
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:06,700
 if I do not see a difference, it is basically a bertolo you can configure

633
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,558
 the hardware you want to have in and is good I recommend using one

634
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:16,839
 virtual if you do not want to pay a beep and have more one virtual and milk and that's it

635
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,499
 good to have separate work machines or the ones we use

636
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:25,538
 to play what the bounty is because we are going to be installing installing

637
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:28,779
 new tools every day and well even good we have out there

638
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:32,910
 differentiated what happened that still bring be saved

639
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,830
 vulnerabilities to report it to them if not it did not happen to me and I hope it does not happen to me

640
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:42,210
 I would never speak highly of them and I think that if they realized it they would be more than

641
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:46,050
 sanctioned by the platform because we do not forget that for them it is a

642
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,490
 work they work from that it is not that they do it like we do it

643
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:55,709
 for a reward they of their work is that oil also as well as in their

644
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,640
 work you have automated the monitoring of your

645
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,990
 target I'm starting to put something together actually

646
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,799
 I have a video where he talked about it and I tell a little about the tools

647
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,819
 automation and I show more or less where what is done not me but

648
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:16,020
 I am currently doing things more manual than automated but the idea

649
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:22,370
 I am putting together something there to do in America, each account does the monitoring

650
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:27,380
 not monitoring basically I have a system that sends me alerts for

651
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,360
 telegram when new domains come out and the idea is to grow this

652
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:37,040
 script to process those subdomains a little more if you don't just send them to me

653
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,570
 when a subdomain appears but send something more elaborate and power or this

654
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:47,030
 subdomain I found that there is this or that file in this subdomain is the idea

655
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,180
 finally having to work as little as possible is what gets us there

656
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:55,700
 more chewed but I'm on the road to health all good to the inside in what

657
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,359
 moment you have to stop hitting a vulnerability to avoid problems

658
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:06,190
 in a possible injection you have to get to what point

659
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:11,320
 well that will be defined in the policies basically of each

660
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,490
 program but once the injection is already demonstrated, it is already

661
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:20,500
 could you demonstrate the injection ready the injection will usually pay between

662
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:25,390
 haye and critical most of is going to be critical

663
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:29,890
 then well that's it there is not much more to do in fact it will be half almost

664
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,549
 It will always be forbidden to climb much more because well we could

665
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,730
 get into a problem you have to read well how the policies of each

666
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,630
 program to be sure of the kinds of things

667
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,260
 I am a beginner, how do I not frustrate myself in case my reports

668
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,880
 have already been reported or are not considered risk for the

669
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,900
 frustration is something we have to deal with every day and be

670
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,320
 beginner or you are not a beginner it will be there

671
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,130
 frustration knocking on the door of your house every day and it is something that

672
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:03,300
 we have to drive it will always happen to you that there will be times that

673
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,450
 find vulnerabilities that will happen what will happen time where not

674
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,720
 find a vulnerability and you will start to rethink if they really are

675
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,600
 good for this or do you have this famous impostor syndrome and then nothing

676
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,290
 one has to start managing frustration and realizing that good

677
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:23,610
 sometimes there is also a bit of luck in finding vulnerabilities in many

678
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,830
 factors, my recommendation is that if they are not going to dedicate 100% to working

679
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:33,090
 doing bound is that they have it as a hobby and that if they are with something very

680
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:37,440
 obsessed and does not go out and well disconnect a little to gain activity

681
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,910
 also and if the only thing they are reporting their vulnerabilities are duplicates

682
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:46,379
 Well, we are on the right track, it means that someone found them before

683
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,339
 person is paying for it but then they are on the right track they have to continue and

684
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:54,299
 vulnerabilities that are not duplicated are going to appear, well I can get in

685
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:59,740
 in legal problems making this yes clear if one does not respect the cops

686
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,049
 just program policies if they can get you in legal trouble

687
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:09,800
 precisely the policies of each program so for that

688
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,450
 luckily the world has advanced a lot and now companies allow us to

689
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:18,620
 hack the interns who get in trouble or the companies invite us

690
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:23,420
 to encourage and pay us is for it but we have to respect what the

691
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,369
 more company says so if you have to be careful

692
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:35,289
 Well, let's see if we have another question for which percentage you dedicate to a

693
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:40,839
 new company verses a company that you already worked

694
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:46,569
 I particularly like to target companies that already have a certain

695
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,890
 amount of time with a bounty program I am not one of those who publishes

696
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:54,308
 a company but in a public company its bounty program and runs

697
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:58,599
 When I see what he finds, I understand that there is a race to see who arrives

698
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,789
 first and who first reports the things that may appear but the

699
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:09,009
 Most of what I have reported were things from companies that already had a

700
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:13,630
 some time in with his bounty show so he devoted a lot more to it

701
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,319
 time to that are not ways how I say this is

702
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:22,390
 something that I do as a hobby in my free time so I do it 23 hours at

703
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:29,308
 nights and not much more than that we are going to close there are a lot of

704
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:34,499
 questions I invite you to answer if you can and if not you can also

705
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:39,468
 write on twitter no problem so we are

706
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:47,080
 let me let you are not leaving five points so let me then had

707
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:52,270
 project to give a big greeting to all the people of hacker space to the ute n

708
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:55,869
 I do it for the invitation and for the space, the truth was that there were two

709
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:59,590
 Excellent days and well, super happy from the bottom I was able to do

710
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:03,910
 this here I have a I did which dictionaries recommended to use or which ones are

711
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:08,589
 use va want bases and used dictionary choices

712
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:12,520
 he used one called the text point and which is made by jason

713
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,330
 haddix which is the one who mentioned the talk in his global gif repository

714
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:20,470
 You will find the dictionaries that the

715
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:23,560
 go buster tool that good now is not being used anymore of this

716
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,609
 tool but using maurel's tool from ir search show

717
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:31,830
 Basically use of their dictionaries or that of the being brings a dictionary himself

718
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:36,009
 built-in that like to do a quick detection to see if there are any

719
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:40,270
 little thing is very very viola without passing the dictionary already has as a dictionary

720
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:46,000
 incorporated so equally in my advice is to build your own dictionary

721
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,750
 always the best for your own dictionary

722
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,430
 look here there is a question that is very good because it is flame at the level of the other

723
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:59,350
 side to company level to company level to make me back bounty that

724
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,549
 platform arme recommended well the truth is that I never

725
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:09,950
 Forget I never faced it from the other side obviously for obvious reasons but

726
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:15,950
 I think the hacker one has jacagua novak but they don't have the models of

727
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:23,060
 very well cooked businesses and the largest number of hackers are concentrated

728
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,200
 in those two great platforms therefore

729
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,129
 3 I guess I don't know I guess their services must be a bit more

730
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,990
 expensive perhaps others but also in the amount of hackers that we can reach

731
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,220
 Finding on these platforms is superior so I would evaluate it like this

732
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:45,569
 which I think could be a very good alternative and if not there is also ours

733
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:53,790
 Latin American platform fertilizers as Fernando said I have the last one the back

734
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:58,350
 the one that goes first when it starts to make a page

735
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:05,009
 no there is no one first the truth that there is no one first I think it is one

736
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:09,510
 web application searched for some there are two is not all the audios are very easy to

737
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:14,040
 detect I usually look on that side to see if there are problems in what is

738
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:19,800
 authorization and others and if not information leakage information microsoft things

739
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:25,020
 that they should not be public to a link of some pic and that kind of thing but

740
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:30,120
 Well then, it's going to look at the application itself and see what comes up, no, no, no

741
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,990
 something punctual and we can have problems if the

742
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:44,120
 ip in the ppc apps if you can get there with reaching the bps wallet but the advantage

743
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,890
 What you have to know that it exists is that we destroy it and create another in two minutes

744
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:54,470
 so there would be no problem and we already have a new ip so that is the advantage for

745
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:59,629
 that is the best thing is not to put our ip that bar extensions that are really

746
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:06,410
 useful for the bounty program there are many, the truth is that I invite you to

747
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:10,310
 let them explore later we have talked about those in the hacking

748
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:15,600
 knight but nothing there is one called collaborator

749
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:22,710
 heuer that is injecting hairs of the collaborator that is one or something that brings

750
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:26,490
 the burj that is very useful to us to find vulnerabilities related to

751
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:31,649
 servers airport for haiti and others that is a very good extension and then

752
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:36,030
 It will depend on the technology we are using, we have an active campaign more than

753
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:40,860
 It's like we're going to provide more, more roads, more than other things

754
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:44,370
 there are many many that well I recommend it just as I was saying to

755
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:47,450
 see in the machine that we have talked about that

756
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:52,089
 has in your case are more than finding bucks

757
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:59,380
 critical medium low or you aim for quality or quantity did not aim prime

758
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:03,400
 lopez arena o2 points sincerely not that I'm going to go saying to barabbas and

759
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,420
 reported only criticism not the realities that reported what I believe

760
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,210
 that can lead to valid vulnerabilities

761
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:14,500
 obviously I try not to report things that do not work or that in my opinion will

762
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:20,620
 be even if they are not applicable but then a critical vulnerability is found

763
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:25,990
 good great but although a 'low I will report it anyway I do not care is

764
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:30,879
 a vulnerability after all, one as a hacker has ethics as ethics

765
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,260
 you have to report any vulnerability later if it is

766
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:41,800
 a good review much better to the clear connecting I made them say how much I know

767
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:48,730
 wins and that depends on the record in time devotedly from home is the

768
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:53,619
 time is the program there are programs as we said that do not pay so it is the

769
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:59,230
 time the dedication the knowledge that each has also the share of

770
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:04,030
 luck, as I was saying, no, you can't estimate, you can't, the truth is

771
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:08,720
 something that cannot be estimated in networking programming system

772
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,000
 operations than the most important to do an mba with general people protocol

773
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,780
 https knowing a little about that is important enough if we are going to hit it

774
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:27,920
 web applications to pee a bit of everything basically have

775
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,970
 You have to understand what it is that you want to aim for.

776
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:35,810
 do more some infra good then some network and others that will come very

777
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:40,520
 fine but if you want mobile web applications good to understand https protocols and

778
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:46,460
 others will be fundamental so it depends on what they want to do

779
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:55,849
 good how much do you know that you are studying in n-ii and why years last night

780
01:03:55,849 --> 01:03:59,830
 to study a technical degree in programming

781
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:05,080
 I was now half grown up I am 34 years old I had gone through several

782
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:11,410
 undergraduate degrees and I never finished any and I said I have to do something but

783
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:16,330
 because I wanted to learn and do something so I ordered the out n

784
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:21,730
 They have very good technical degrees, they are based in Avellaneda and I am

785
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:25,930
 studying a technical degree in programming and it is two years says the

786
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:29,649
 first year already relevant and now I have finished so good we are studying

787
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:37,030
 there the second year later one can articulate with you can point to a

788
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:39,760
 degree career but I think it's a good ping point and be like for

789
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,700
 start with the technique if one does not want to start fully in the

790
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:47,109
 engineering or something that you already know very well that it will be many years

791
01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:53,859
 well well let's go thank you very much indeed many of us know that it is a topic

792
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:57,390
 quite requested

793
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:04,339
 we are leaving and we are going to close in a little while I remind you that

794
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:12,200
 It is in the after so everyone stay but I thank you very much thanks to

795
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,560
 you for the invitation and open for any type of question contact me

796
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,310
