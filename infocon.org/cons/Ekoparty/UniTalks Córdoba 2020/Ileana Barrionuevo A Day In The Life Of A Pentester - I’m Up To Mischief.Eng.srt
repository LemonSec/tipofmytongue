1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,770
good good how are you I hope you are having a good time

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,530
 after the talk of the genius of emiliano who comes to raise the new is

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,299
 she is an engineer is also a researcher in being computer science pen

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,669
 tester and above all things and what he has is that he is married from backs and

5
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:23,210
 She is very passionate and also something that always caught my attention about her that

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,659
 She is a phishing hunter, that is, she can ask any day of the year

7
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:31,189
 what fiction there is on the internet and she knows it there are two alternatives she has a

8
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,030
 script that is browsing the internet looking for the physical ones that exist or

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,329
 they sophie if nothing is done so well come on let's go see what he says today

10
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,100
 In his talk he called a day in the life of a bridge, I think it will be very

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,030
 good so good let's hear about 2 now I share the screen

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,530
 I hope you like the talk

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,500
 Well basically, as German said in this talk, it will be focused on the penta

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,440
 sting web that currently I perform as

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,270
 network operator in the systems laboratory of the facu and I am also

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,170
 doing safety analysis at the research and development center of

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:30,210
 the same facu on the other hand I am teaching yes and I am studying

18
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,380
 currently my second year of masters in systems in the same facu

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,509
 well I solemnly swear that my intentions do not die we are going to see a

20
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,570
 a lot of hacking stuff so clarifications need to be made from the

21
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,000
 good start first I'm going to explain how to start

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,810
 how I got into what is the security team what activities are done from

23
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,580
 the systems laboratory which methodologies we carry out what

24
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,170
 tools we are going to do a little emo I am going to tell you what the

25
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,340
 vulnerabilities that I like to find, let's talk a little about the

26
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,920
 documentation on what the pen test is and I will provide you with some resources

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,869
 that can serve those who want to start with the theme well

28
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,970
 well I tell you how everything went as a start it turns out that I was in

29
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,380
 third year and I began to attend the safety talks that were given

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,750
 from the systems laboratory and I liked the subject so I said

31
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,330
 I want to do this so in fourth year I got involved with a group of guys who do

32
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,090
 sales were working on the subject in the systems lab but

33
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,140
 discontinuous a bit this I already started reading documentation on my own already

34
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,200
 look for information on platforms etc and in the fifth year I got the

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,129
 despair because I say good but what am I going to do to make him receive me

36
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:03,149
 because we are already doing the thesis I like all areas

37
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,950
 I like development I like testing I like analysis design I don't know

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,518
 artificial intelligence but I did not see myself in a single of these things and it was there that

39
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,230
 I found out that I really liked the wheel area so I went to the

40
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,819
 systems lab were looking for people for what is infrastructure

41
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:28,589
 So there I spoke with the teacher Fabian who joined his team

42
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,800
 and in parallel we start with the final project to receive more where we have to

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,950
 make a system then as we develop it we start doing things

44
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,459
 How is it where there I said we are doing we are deleting a user without

45
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,560
 unauthorized authentication without any control we are saving

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,150
 contraction in plain text in the database

47
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,000
 and then there I was alarmed I said why do we have to add security and well this

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,920
 My thesis colleagues no longer know it, but I had to go through all the

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,760
 end-to-end functionalities redo them adding all the validations

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,130
 I can think of being some layers that were a [ __ ] but what was done

51
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,238
 it was possible until we all began to be aware of how to build a

52
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,729
 safe software well in parallel also began to

53
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,479
 work on it in the systems lab we started

54
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,099
 With different research projects, projects related to safety are carried out

55
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:38,740
 web to kernel operating system level cybersecurity

56
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,270
 I also started with some activities providing information for those who

57
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,758
 they would like to join in afterwards as soon as I graduated I started working at the center

58
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:55,150
 research of the facu in the development center and we began to do with

59
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:01,299
 different pen test reviews as of today we do all this both to the

60
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,280
 systems that are developed in the development center as well as for

61
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,219
 external entities something that we achieve is to incorporate security in all

62
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,060
 phases of the software development video cycle both from the development stage

63
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,909
 requirements through analysis development deployment maintenance as well

64
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:25,860
 it's like we manage what the security ticket is too

65
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,680
 then it is prima sprint stage of stage we are following that ticket of

66
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,069
 vulnerability that we were finding until we made sure that

67
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,400
 corrected well we did some training

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,919
 also to others to other entities that require these services and all

69
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,780
 years we carried out with the boys of the xxxix the week of the security in the

70
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,679
 ute n open to the entire community and to anyone who wants to join

71
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,460
 and well we also carry out some activities among ourselves there with

72
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,299
 German who coordinates us and gives us his knowledge as well and now we

73
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,430
 we focus squarely on what is the back penis joint penetration test

74
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,280
 we can already see it as a set of offensive tests or a simulated attack

75
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,989
 with the aim of finding vulnerabilities for later

76
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,440
 exploit them and of course cut them, that is, we have to act as

77
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,410
 attackers but this is important of course there has to be an agreement with the other

78
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,529
 part is saying it's not that I can do a penetration test

79
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:43,969
 to any system because it occurs to me if there have to be commitments

80
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:49,909
 two parts, that is, we can see how to hack buy ourselves like this seen from another

81
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:54,300
 form this phrase that I like a lot is to use the

82
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,590
 offense to inform the defense find fault before people

83
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,690
 malicious will do yes we will have some some types of

84
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,270
 plants we have black box and white box black box sales we sometimes have a

85
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,099
 blind access to a url and nothing else is the only thing we have to perform the

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,690
 pen test may also be that there is documentation from which we can take

87
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,920
 some information and to be able to face it with the view of the business or it can be

88
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,210
 a bridge from Casablanca where we already have to thoroughly analyze the

89
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,430
 code and configuration files this is clear my talk is going to be

90
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,090
 Focused learns to play yes but the pp can be done at any stage of the game.

91
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:48,130
 development can be a good test to the requirements to the design to the code to the

92
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,800
 libraries are using can be in an environment taking into account everything

93
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,120
 above plus the technologies of a server in testing the configurations

94
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,439
 I can turn on wireless networks I can make bridges they have a

95
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,150
 organization taking all of the above plus social engineering techniques such as

96
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,869
 which we saw in the previous talk and well some things that we have in

97
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:18,719
 account in each penders with the boys is the time range with which we will

98
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:23,279
 count is to say from what time to what time what days if we go to work

99
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,119
 holidays take into account that limitations may appear because

100
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:30,869
 good times we are facing a saturday a sunday and the other good side

101
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:34,559
 we fell we did tests' case everything and there is no one to pick it up after

102
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,239
 served on where we are going to do it in what

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,650
 environment like this is for testing if it is for testing if it is for pre-production on what

104
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,010
 functionalities because sometimes the client is interested in a couple of

105
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:53,060
 functions of the system for us to do tests there it is for

106
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,640
 we always make you what stages we are going to do what access out there we are going to

107
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,170
 have what documentation we are going to deliver so we can deliver a technical report

108
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,219
 of recommendations a technical report with the vulnerabilities or a report

109
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,990
 executive according to what they request us and we generally group in

110
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,520
 four stages can be broken down as much as you want but easier to see

111
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,930
 in this way the recognition stage where we look for information about the

112
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,359
 objective then later with all the information collected we will

113
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,560
 the search for vulnerabilities, although it is worth clarifying that in the

114
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,689
 recognition tends to appear these vulnerabilities after the

115
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:44,590
 we exploit and finally report each one in a report although we do not need

116
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,360
 Well, for 20 servings it starts, you can see that when you open the

117
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,580
 browser can press the f12 key and the browser tools appear.

118
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,750
 developer can see the watch tabs where I can see the code

119
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,010
 page source I can also see in the tab

120
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:09,460
 network network all the requests that are being made but we work yes

121
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,370
 or yes with a proxy because it is faster and what we do is put a program

122
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,950
 intermediate between what is the browser we are using or the

123
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,990
 device because it can be a cell phone or a tablet to be able to intercept everything

124
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,000
 what comes out of here everything that the person does intercept it modify it

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,520
 send it like this internet yes then I can manipulate all this

126
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,650
 well here is an example we make a lot of bugs and it is a proxy that

127
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,959
 here we can see all the requests that were being made here there is one in

128
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,580
 particular and we see that from the browser part this information comes out only

129
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,529
 I can send to any of these tabs and start modifying

130
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:02,949
 Well apart from work set we use a lot of terminals in the linux terminal.

131
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:07,529
 commands tools that we are downloading from git hub that other hackers upload

132
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:13,120
 we use website to do traffic analysis we complement with the proxy of

133
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,230
 waters and now we start with the part of

134
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,059
 recognitions and this stage I always suggest spending time

135
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:27,579
 because sometimes it helps us to get a lot of information and how

136
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,989
 I said vulnerabilities may begin to appear here and it also helps us

137
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,949
 to see how big is the organization or the objective to which we have to

138
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,430
 cope and collect a lot of information

139
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,399
 Well about I share if there is a problem you know elmer I do not think but we are going to

140
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:52,010
 start with what is infrastructure yes each street I have not all commands and what

141
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,450
 things we give thanks girlfriend first we will find out all the information

142
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,180
 possible of an ip or a domain suppose instagram dotcom I open

143
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,260
 this site and here I put instagram dotcom it

144
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,490
 Look here, all this information will appear. I have to collect it.

145
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:18,930
 take notes if I see things that are not well understood out there I hope that

146
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,760
 they can serve me later to detect certain configurations I can see

147
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:32,819
 site info ipv6 wheels ranges this is pretty good yeah

148
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,080
 there are many more resources I can simply do a search in google I put

149
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,480
 instagram dotcom and all this looking for pre-production development environments

150
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,699
 things that are exposed well another part that I like a lot

151
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,679
 is to do pen testing of the infrastructure with the commas the others

152
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,129
 not only port scanning because I can also go pulling scripts and

153
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:05,929
 try different things of authentication scanning by default

154
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,759
 I will look for all those services that the website may have active at

155
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,910
 see where I can enter if a script that I like a lot is the one with the maps and the

156
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,429
 that we found out related vulnerabilities if we open ourselves

157
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:29,149
 vulnerabilities that are referred to respiro here suppose instagram

158
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:36,579
 dotcom i'm gonna put this in sweat

159
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:43,780
 I just shoot and I test if there are any services that are active

160
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,010
 kind of vulnerability I already knew if I left it there running fine

161
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,930
 all find out if you have malware etc. detects the operating system

162
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,839
 well now we move on to what are certified

163
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,459
 I am still out there in what is infrastructure I can look for information

164
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:08,920
 of the ssl certificates that are associated with a bears domain when

165
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,079
 expire I can do it with the commands of the map also if I can detect if

166
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,430
 Is there a protocol that is already obsolete? What vulnerabilities are there?

167
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:26,109
 There is a lot of information but for time reasons we will not

168
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,920
 we are going to postpone there and now we move on to what is enumeration

169
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,689
 of domains or subdomains well for those who combed know

170
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,560
 this is my main domain suppose dotcom example I'm going to try

171
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,069
 search triple point example dotcom corp point example dotcom etc. yes

172
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,690
 then I use generally accept der I like it a lot

173
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:57,380
 what is usually combined with other tools for example we will see here

174
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,670
 I want to find out why you should get this subdomain I want them to look for me

175
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:08,550
 all that find and have the output of this command I want to see what

176
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,910
 http services https exist active and I am going to show them and at the same time

177
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:22,770
 I save in a file like that then there it goes to look for a lot of things yes or yes take

178
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,560
 note keep saving the information in

179
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,300
 files ok let's go another tool you used

180
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,779
 much is not there, although some cases no longer recommend them because it is medium slow

181
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:43,000
 It is true but there are other tools that are based on spike

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,820
 For example, this one takes away, I like it a lot, yes

183
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:55,400
 this tool particularly what it does is search in different services

184
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,140
 information about instagram domains referred to their domains and also what to

185
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,380
 I like it is that it will try to take screenshots

186
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,760
 Well then, here it will take a while but they will see that later it will

187
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,810
 Bring information, let's see if you save the map and dig in a bit, it doesn't matter.

188
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:23,439
 fine fine domain there are a lot of tools closer it is very fast

189
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,910
 she is very good joe dan inevitable I can search this site here

190
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,459
 some services that are exposed to be able to filter by different words

191
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:42,279
 yes virustotal I also love this because I can take a certificate

192
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,460
 search

193
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,889
 two children are valid 40 certificates

194
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:57,009
 and he could also take the output of a command and put it in others to make it

195
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,220
 directory brute force finding paths yes

196
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,199
 here if you want good we make a little beach for each one as he left the command

197
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,130
 above and took a screenshot to avoid having to open each

198
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,349
 page that I find at hand clarified that this was taken from a hacker called

199
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:21,129
 am a lot of info is shared many recognition tips until very good

200
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,329
 well for example next to these three commands of these three functions and

201
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:34,649
 I just come here and shoot record let's say instagram

202
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,909
 dotcom and well I'm going to start doing a lot

203
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:43,019
 of things they found their domains and each one is going to pass this other

204
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,570
 command, let's see what does this do right?

205
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,240
 we continue we go to brand discovery so they do not get lost we are here in the

206
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,100
 third stage like this great album and here it helps us

207
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,669
 find services that a company today of my objective has acquired 6b try

208
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,350
 to get an idea of ​​how big the organization is to also see which one is going

209
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:14,029
 to be the impact of the vulnerability that I find you and I exploited

210
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:18,320
 and well here we can do other searches in google can be done from

211
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:26,230
 everything with google basically and we go to the content search we are here

212
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,850
 byrs which is the tool that I am throwing along with the others which is going to

213
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:37,689
 to do is try to search on routes that are exposed

214
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,769
 based on these and then here for example you will do tests

215
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:49,000
 look here no longer is this a route is going to try to do a lot of tests and with

216
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,100
 different types of extensions I come master I can also use it search

217
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,209
 backup files look for urls that are in the site there are

218
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,990
 everything to do we went to what is parameter search they saw that a

219
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,720
 Sometimes reele juices usually have parameters or things here that receive a

220
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,500
 value yes then with these tools we will

221
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,870
 try to find possible parameters to be able to exploit them through

222
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,699
 different tests and I can use google docs back I can

223
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,220
 look for developer codes that is turning I tell you what is my

224
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,320
 target what is the name of the company that looks for things that are exposed

225
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,809
 I can filter by passwords that have left there is a lot of information if I search

226
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,779
 three-wire boards that are public to see if someone left any

227
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:53,019
 password of something well look for sensitive files exposed well I'm going through

228
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:57,129
 good hawking hub for those who do not know is a

229
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,990
 code repository tool where developers can apply

230
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,450
 versioned and there what we can do filter by keywords and I put

231
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:13,509
 Suppose instagram dotcom from and I'm going to look for development stuff to look for

232
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:19,340
 keys happy keys tokens things that should not be public

233
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,560
 I can search with this command information about committees I put

234
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,389
 Suppose instagram dotcom and he is going to find me some little things

235
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:34,619
 interesting all do recognition of baquets see if there are any that me

236
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:39,889
 allows reading and writing that should not

237
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:47,090
 good information about everywhere and this part now we are going here

238
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,110
 identification of technologies we always emphasize here too

239
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,750
 because with these exceedances is what we identify is how the

240
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:04,170
 site if to see if I can show you here well this is still looking I will not

241
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:11,940
 cut because it is not cut we are going to good just talking about phishing last night my

242
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:20,480
 sister passed me an email that takes them and I saw that it was a place where a person

243
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,800
 where someone is trying to get you to put the credentials and then the

244
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,200
 I have been analyzing a bit here with this extension I can see what it is

245
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,660
 made the site why does this serve me because there I can detect if there is

246
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,260
 technologies that are outdated or already have vulnerabilities then it is me

247
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,440
 easier to exploit will say good to see the dispatch I will look for

248
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,990
 lightspeed vulnerabilities I google

249
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,930
 I see that it appears and I will try to exploit those vulnerabilities

250
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,660
 then as I tell you in the recognition stage we can already find

251
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,780
 some vulnerabilities and here well I have other things I have here lamas ixe

252
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,480
 click of the magician that I hand up there it helps us a lot it has many tips

253
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:15,360
 The magician is going to give you another talk, well, we continue

254
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,709
 so keep in mind always take note of being able to try to automate what

255
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,450
 more can sometimes well it is impossible to automate one hundred percent there are many

256
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,429
 things in recognition that are manual or I like to do manual I do not know

257
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,990
 get discouraged if sometimes something gives you an error I see forbidden keep looking

258
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:43,130
 more things may appear and well here what I did was put these

259
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,350
 commands I found in these hackers scripts and put them in my rc database

260
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:54,168
 from linux and then I invoke that function and it is done just magically

261
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:58,889
 good to do what is search having

262
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:05,369
 collected all misinformation we always rely on the lowe's' top

263
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:10,289
 ten 'of most frequent vulnerabilities in web applications we also take the

264
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,120
 apis vulnerabilities 'top ten'

265
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,629
 but this does not mean that they are the only things that we seek to

266
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,580
 Sometimes we don't focus on things related to the business, we go for others

267
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,000
 vulnerabilities that we know may exist and which layers that are not in the

268
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,920
 paper you do not have to limit yourself to just that, well a lot here is manual

269
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,670
 we try to go through all the functionalities that we have to do

270
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:43,100
 pen test we try to prioritize and be creative with other searches

271
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,929
 we try to help ourselves with engines like google like bing if there are things is that in

272
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,880
 google do not seem to me I will try to look for them in bing or in another search engine

273
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,960
 we get things from twitter there are many hackers who upload their tests

274
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,610
 the tools and hub, here I am using cali which is a distribution of

275
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:06,350
 linux already prepared with tools you depend on but this does not mean that

276
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,370
 is the only thing I have to use to use the operating system with which I

277
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,610
 feel comfortable well then we already talked about this you can

278
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,860
 look for vulnerabilities on technologies that are already exposed

279
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:26,409
 We try to make the system make the happy path and the unhappy one is treated

280
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,429
 always try not forget the basic tests sometimes we

281
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:34,720
 we go through the branches we say well I want to test this super vulnerability

282
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,980
 but let's not forget that even the most basic can be

283
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,880
 pay attention to the errors do not be discouraged because I will show you

284
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,530
 later on that errors help a lot to detect vulnerabilities good

285
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,210
 here we have an example when they automatically know when someone sees this

286
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,340
 error on a page we put on the hood and started testing that collins

287
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,970
 exxon although we spent in the exploitation part

288
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:11,440
 taking all of the above we are going to start doing many manual tests we can

289
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,500
 automate some things taking into account different tests that people went

290
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,380
 uploading for example to a repository that has for each

291
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,090
 various vulnerability tests that I can throw in my proxy tool and

292
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,928
 there that you are already doing them while I have been with other things

293
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,810
 well what we always try is that the

294
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:39,240
 impact is maximized is exterior I can find a vulnerability and so but

295
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,420
 It is a repaired way but you always have to look for the return

296
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:52,320
 so that it affects the business so then we try to go testing with users not

297
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,240
 authorized and with different levels of privilege to increase the impact

298
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,830
 well intruders is a tab inside the

299
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:07,639
 proxy that its use that sport suite there we can pass the tests that are in

300
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:13,080
 this page for example I use a lot of repeater also which is another tab of the

301
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,949
 proxy sql map although there are many tests that can be

302
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:23,620
 calmly do manual metasploit xs hunter asynchronous what we

303
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,399
 used to test denial of service

304
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,080
 I can not miss I tell you good xs hunter look for the

305
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,600
 vulnerability google xs s for those who do not know

306
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,629
 and allows us to add these tests in any field

307
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:47,399
 that we want or directly in the request I for example here in nothing

308
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,199
 more are in the search field I can complete with this which is painted for

309
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,520
 see if the other side exploits that vulnerability but what can happen that

310
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:03,179
 at the moment I throw this and it does not explode x is that saint what he is going to do is

311
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:10,260
 notify month and for example on the other side an administrator opened the logs and

312
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,200
 exploits the vulnerability is going to send me an email see here for example I have as

313
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,150
 100 emails from 15 hunter telling me that what I threw really exploded

314
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:27,790
 It will send you screenshots of specifying from which ip they are very

315
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,409
 good I recommend you on a platform in the

316
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,260
 good and now we move on to the vulnerabilities that I like

317
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:41,060
 find good all those related to access control there is always something to

318
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:47,159
 exploit this vulnerability not for nothing in the 'top ten' of vulnerabilities

319
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:55,010
 Nazis of waters is at the beginning yes he explained to them what it consists of suppose

320
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:00,800
 that I am in a place where I have all my data, my documentation and a

321
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,950
 particular document has a wide identifier and number 1000 and I

322
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:13,010
 It happens because you choose well to see what happens I change it for one thousand two yes and suddenly

323
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:18,020
 I get information from another user that is already a vulnerability always and

324
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,330
 when the page should not be able to do this like this

325
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,340
 clearly I just use the firefox containers that allow me

326
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:34,000
 open different tabs concessions for the same site or person and chrome and

327
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,929
 good intruder who is within webs today I tell you something I found

328
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:47,500
 He clarified the report, it was corrected, it delayed the correction, but hey

329
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,530
 I insisted that it be done I accessed the personal data of others

330
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,330
 users turns out to be that one day I was trying to do a procedure in

331
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:04,830
 a well-known page here in Córdoba and I couldn't because it told me that my data

332
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:10,949
 They weren't at the base and I can't be so that I did quickly efe 12

333
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:17,280
 developer tools I am going to see what is on the website and I found in

334
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,500
 the html simply with the browser here is set with a capture of the proxy

335
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,049
 but with the browser I saw it videos 2 xerez the that two routes and I said good

336
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:31,940
 What happens if I agree, I'm going to see, but because I wanted to, I said, well, I'm going to try

337
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,110
 even if it is to access then when one finds these

338
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:44,550
 things try to look for those vulnerabilities via

339
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:50,669
 I accessed triple of example dotcom capital for one for two yes and that

340
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,840
 he returned from the other side he returned me low erre he is one of them

341
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,580
 I saw that it received by parameters a bridge and a parameter is called that

342
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,320
 operator who did not know what it was but blue that was a which I do not know why I said good

343
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,370
 I am going to see if it is a neck and another url that is good for reasons that I had to

344
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,899
 take by the image not to include but that supposedly brings the profile picture

345
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,660
 chihuahua to see that he is sad accessed the page

346
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:26,710
 and I say I will put my cuit in those parameters if then any request

347
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,530
 to the site is entered the site with my cuit in the two fields and it turns out that

348
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:38,560
 I got information about my cohabiting group on my email my cell phone

349
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,820
 date of birth name page and so I say good to see change the cuil for the

350
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,919
 from another person to see what happens but from here in my mother's with my

351
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:57,160
 brother my dad and I gave myself to try with others to see how good it exists

352
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,530
 a test and obtained information about this man Juan Schiaretti there is tape the

353
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,899
 information so that it does not make a link but the profile photo is missing

354
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,940
 I said ok let's enter dotcom example approval bring profile picture

355
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:20,840
 yes then what happens exploded I said good a mistake

356
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,658
 but do not discourage me because because the error was already revealing to me that the

357
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:31,730
 page needed me to send him a quiz and here I think there are like three

358
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,130
 vulnerabilities first because they are without error handling, that is, they are not

359
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,909
 handling the Arabs well, exposing sensitive data because on top of that if

360
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:47,179
 set next to what is in red mex - it was showing me the server path in a

361
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:53,619
 where that project is stored and well the other one that is broken access

362
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:57,879
 control that is the one that we are seeing to see I say good I send him the cuil and

363
00:31:57,879 --> 00:32:05,199
 So I send him my co and then this guy's and I got this which is base 64

364
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,940
 In other words, it is something that is encoded, so there is information, I said well, let's

365
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:16,119
 to transform the ba 64 into image format and that I got the profile photo of

366
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,330
 this scanner then it seems super serious to me

367
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,668
 report and of course another vulnerability was corrected on another site was

368
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:32,210
 that I saw my messages my procedures I went to the page and I noticed that here I had

369
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,250
 an identifier of the process what happens if I change it if I start

370
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:43,070
 Tehran automates this part and get paperwork than you imagine

371
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,600
 here for example there is claudia a request for a medical folder for a

372
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,830
 diagnosis of gastroenteritis and getting pregnant but everything had been processed

373
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:58,110
 guy then well this seems to me also serious reported and corrected

374
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:03,600
 well then always look at the source code pay attention to the errors i

375
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,899
 what I do after recognition is also create two or more

376
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,990
 accounts with different levels of privileges whenever you can

377
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,970
 and trying to scale another vulnerability that I really like

378
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:21,670
 is that of business logic is usually between 5 and 10 percent of the

379
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,600
 vulnerabilities that one can sometimes find in a pen test but they are very

380
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,139
 interesting because they usually have a high impact

381
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:36,500
 in this case the problems are in the design stage not so much it is fault

382
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,410
 of the poor developer but there is still a lack of validations in the

383
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:48,170
 process or they are not correctly implemented, it may happen that there is

384
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,550
 validations only in intermediate stages of the process imagine at a stage of

385
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,850
 payments with payment terms and that in the initial stage

386
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,379
 I enter certain information in the middle it is validated and at the end

387
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:06,410
 detected that nothing is validated so I can skip in stages and by

388
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:14,809
 example pay 0 pesos or negative or less see here it is difficult to automate now

389
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:20,089
 It depends more on the business of the platform that is being tested I love them

390
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:23,590
 these vulnerabilities is playing a lot with logic

391
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:30,610
 Well in another of my sales imagine a scholarship application is not the case

392
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:36,040
 but we are going to do like this it is easier to imagine what a person suppose

393
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,409
 going to register your registration remains in an initiated state you have to go through

394
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:47,199
 certain validations then goes through intermediate states and then remains in

395
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:53,889
 a state to pay that is to say that person who adapts so that they pay him the money

396
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:58,779
 what I did was make that inscription jump from one state to another

397
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,760
 without going through the intermediate realizations well that I detect with that

398
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,190
 the happy road I discovered that I could create duplicate inscriptions well I go

399
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,740
 to use one of them I make him go through the whole little path, felix, I'm going to see what is going on

400
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:20,830
 appearing in the proxy what requests are attending I know what actions and I will

401
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,910
 try to make it go from started to pay then here we have the machine

402
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:31,990
 states if you look here the first state is started then it will go through

403
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,180
 validations remains in the accepted state in the payable state if then it stops given and

404
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,060
 In the end, what I want to do is go directly from started to pay without

405
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,200
 that person meets the conditions required to be

406
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,669
 there well what did I do good I observed that the

407
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:58,360
 requests all these sent the identifier of the inscription then

408
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,970
 what I did was lists change here I put here going to send to see what happens to me

409
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:10,180
 returned code 200 that is ok and confirm and really in your registration it was in

410
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,259
 a state to pay is to say to the person they are not going to pay something that they should not

411
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,160
 receive because it does not meet the conditions

412
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,109
 well here yes or yes try to always set the normal path the happy path

413
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:29,110
 see what happens at the intermediate points try to repeat steps in understanding if

414
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:33,040
 or if the business is important, try this, I don't know

415
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,500
 suppose if it is a price field they try to test negative values ​​at

416
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:45,090
 extremes is super big of everything to see what happens

417
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,230
 well and now comes the stage where we have to show that what

418
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:55,910
 we found are vulnerabilities yes then well

419
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:02,549
 we generally always do the technical report with all the

420
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,090
 specifications that we clarified at the beginning about the methodology in which

421
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,680
 environment is going to be done what access do I have to what features what stages are we going to

422
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,250
 to do what the output will be here we make a summary name

423
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,810
 We detail the recognition stage so that the client understands how

424
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,790
 we did the step by step and then each vulnerability in the annex we will use

425
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,808
 place images other relevant information

426
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:36,859
 and for each vulnerability we put a title if we put, for example, access to

427
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:43,819
 unauthorized data in alhué red categories we rely on eggs for

428
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:49,590
 example the category of logical business the category of that colin jackson

429
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,600
 to category d when the ones we saw I think in access

430
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:59,839
 control sometimes the black ones we use a little more and we put a score of

431
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,370
 criticality or severity how serious this vulnerability is, we calculate it with

432
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:10,819
 maitre's page where is the score you assign is based on how much

433
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:15,320
 affects confidentiality integrity and availability and in

434
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,760
 how was this vulnerability discovered, that is, let's see, I had high privileges

435
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,810
 when you speak detect if the attack was complex then everything

436
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:31,009
 that will affect the score may be high medium low critical

437
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:37,610
 Well in the description we usually put the impact here always both in the title

438
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:42,790
 as the description I recommend that the language be as less technical as possible

439
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,870
 because because when we present the client if it is not the same to put sql

440
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:53,270
 injection in such I deleted l that put access to unauthorized data in the

441
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:58,250
 client will be more interested and more impacted to see what the effect of

442
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,050
 that of that exploitation then it has to be something that the client really

443
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,730
 may give may take after detail if we are as technical as

444
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,610
 we can so that it is known how it was exploited how it was found and exploded

445
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,650
 We put that it was what we called our attention some recommendations that in

446
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,460
 In the case of the development center, we do them on site with the equipment already

447
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,299
 We work with the teams and well of course the images do not

448
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:30,930
 may be missing because they are proof of vulnerability

449
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:38,149
 and here well we have a photo of pen testing of 2017 we did

450
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:46,260
 we count according to category we saw that the access control category

451
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,290
 broken is the one that wins by a landslide and to this day these problems are still in

452
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,839
 we detect bridges a lot and well too and if we collect information and

453
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:04,020
 we saw that the problems are mostly in the development stage but also

454
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,790
 in the design stage it means that only here is where there are problems in

455
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,730
 the design stage is where we also have the origin

456
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:22,210
 I saw some pros and cons of working in infosec or what it is to turn on

457
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,430
 well, the pros, what I like is the flexible working hours

458
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,049
 remote everything can be done from home flexible schedule because sometimes

459
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:36,700
 we have 24 hours to do a pen test so we coordinate with the boys

460
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:43,620
 of the team to see when we start when it suits us when one can

461
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:49,940
 and well some cons that I see it that is at a macro level not so much from me from me

462
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:57,840
 from my job but I still see that sometimes security is still

463
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,990
 leaving for the end that is, it is like the developer has to over the

464
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,220
 code and only then we test them to see if there is something but from the beginning

465
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,830
 no no I consider that there has to be a follow-up from the beginning, there has to be

466
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,490
 incorporating security from the point of contact with the customer to the customer

467
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:23,250
 The client who proposes a system will never tell us well, I want you to

468
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:28,560
 have this method decrypted this algorithm not the client sometimes does not know

469
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,690
 then I consider that you have to go and request these requirements that are

470
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,850
 missing because in the long run they will end up costing the system

471
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:43,319
 then this must be transferred to the next stages of both analysis and

472
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,150
 design and incorporate it as safety acceptance criteria for example

473
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:54,660
 then, those who receive that information in the different stages go

474
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,000
 incorporating they design according to those things then the developer goes

475
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,960
 to be a clean program or take care of it because in reality another of the blocks

476
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,560
 is that a system is never exempt from vulnerabilities so we will have

477
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,009
 I always work that is great and good to go transferring it to all

478
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,790
 stages of the software development video cycle yes

479
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:27,560
 Well here he told you resources I have seen many questions in the chat this morning

480
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,460
 I recommend always practicing every day even if it is practice not one

481
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,840
 vulnerability try new things

482
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,660
 look out there vulnerabilities that are less common out there cost a

483
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:47,600
 a little more but but surely it gets you find me read books read

484
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:53,960
 wright apps documentation join infosec groups on forums search

485
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,860
 the vulnerabilities that are emerging in the different systems both at the level of

486
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,180
 hardware and software participate are I really like the videos of

487
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:08,870
 background and university I also recommend that you read the testing guide of

488
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:15,480
 mushrooms I started with this also subscribe to the dels newsletter

489
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,980
 anys jazztel subscribed I get all the vulnerabilities and out there news

490
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:27,780
 important worldwide well there are some books for which they want to spend

491
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,120
 Twitter accounts that this has been of these hackers who are uploading things there

492
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,650
 many more but it is impossible to make them all participate the ctf is

493
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,150
 this month they are doing many competitions at the security level

494
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:47,610
 free can participate do not be afraid does us sometimes although

495
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,960
 know little try the roms are going to break their heads against the wall without

496
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,930
 sure but that's how you learn well that was all I leave you my contact

497
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:03,279
 mischief made I hope you liked it very good very good very good and

498
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,280
 the truth was that it was very good

499
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:14,509
 well here I have some questions before moving on with them

500
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:19,069
 it is necessary to make a clarification that to make an analysis an active scan and

501
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:25,550
 of course after exploiting an area you have to have a signed agreement

502
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:32,000
 or the owner of that website for example or from the company and the owner of a

503
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,740
 company or a representative of the company that allows you to do that

504
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,209
 scanning is important to keep in mind so that when you practice

505
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:46,550
 practice on the basis of sites that are exclusive for that

506
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:52,059
 to test I know there is a lot on the internet but to do those tests well

507
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:59,150
 advancing with a couple of before advanced there is a request that is if you are going to

508
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:03,589
 give access to the notion of your notes of

509
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:10,549
 that you presented there of commands and if you can give access to the link

510
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:15,279
 well that I don't know how you can pass it

511
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:20,329
 danny vale somehow we published it in the

512
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:23,979
 presentation seems to me in app

513
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,719
 Yes, well, regarding the questions, we have a park that we went to.

514
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,590
 writing down here and there is one that I want to do to you

515
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:43,730
 the first question is if you consider that it is necessary to use lime and linux or can you

516
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:49,170
 use for example 1 point to do all your day-to-day activities

517
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:55,040
 Well, I clarified that, German does not pay me this attention very badly

518
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,250
 They can use the operating system that is comfortable for them. I got out of Cali because

519
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,530
 I saw that the new version came out I wanted to prove that there was new but a lot

520
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:10,619
 time according to you was installing expels me and what is comfortable can

521
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:15,210
 be windows with shock virtual machines I out there recommend using

522
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,319
 virtual machines because I do not know there are things that can affect the machine

523
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:23,609
 host machine mouth then I don't want them to mix there are some

524
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:30,339
 configurations or affect the system but they can use the system that as

525
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:36,299
 because I know that you in principle oscar and linux but as in the virtual brand

526
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,849
 of course if it continues in a virtual ok other questions we have here is

527
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:49,710
 that what are the tools and that they answer it there attention

528
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:56,079
 It is a bit that they really are the one that you use the most day by day or for example what type

529
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,890
 of proxies or the one most used if it is burke if this app or which

530
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:09,470
 at the beginning when I started I used only the approx and I liked it a lot but

531
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,129
 Later I got used to boxer shorts and to this day I think it's what I use the most

532
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:19,730
 sometimes I like to see some alerts that pull pulls up but I think

533
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:25,780
 I do almost everything with bots and other basic ones that are good in map

534
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,650
 I love I love the equipment it has, some are intrusive, others are not

535
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,250
 you have to learn to use them but they are very good

536
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:39,579
 well well another question here we have

537
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:45,430
 If you consider that with free tools or tools you can carry out the

538
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,288
 work or there you need to reach the term level of professionalism

539
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:54,570
 you need to have a proprietary or licensed tool

540
00:47:54,570 --> 00:48:01,860
 I think that if it can be done in fact I have read some books of other hackers

541
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,820
 and they do everything with unlicensed tools and they do very well

542
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,800
 i dont think its impossible but i think the licensed tools too

543
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,120
 provide more functionality needed to test new

544
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,970
 vulnerabilities is easier considered than

545
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:27,368
 has to at least one license cannot be paid and go trying new things and

546
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:34,120
 well well well another question we have here is that

547
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:40,029
 so long on average does a web bridge or an analysis of

548
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:46,460
 an example application I know that I am not the application here but more or less

549
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:53,330
 and it depends there are sales that we continue to make indefinite but

550
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,380
 because they ask us but sometimes some are with a limited time and they tell us

551
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,560
 Well, they have two weeks to try because this is going to come out later.

552
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,080
 production then we have this time 24 hours to test and

553
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,140
 usually a bridge is two weeks sometimes we end up doing

554
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,799
 five days or so recognitions so see how important it is

555
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:21,609
 that stage to find vulnerabilities

556
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:28,020
 and another interesting question out there that helps in the process of making bridges

557
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:33,720
 for the beginning is that really recommended to do a search for

558
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:40,279
 domain subdomains good until the end is very fast is the

559
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,970
 that I showed you and the other one that I like a lot is your lady

560
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:53,770
 that uses behind many web services and is totally cold so they can

561
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:58,900
 use quietly and automates them a lot in the recognition part

562
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,339
 In other words, the search for domains or go buster domains is very fast.

563
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:06,400
 I showed why, well for a matter of time, but I am combining it

564
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,730
 with test lists that have been uploaded to the internet then one is also made

565
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,630
 You can try and find different things according to the word

566
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:23,680
 list that one provides height is understood very well very good or we try

567
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,480
 with several questions another one if you commented that out there it reports

568
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,900
 this some vulnerabilities to websites that already exist

569
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:43,010
 that process as it was and if in the first instance good of course of some

570
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,309
 How did you communicate how that communication was and no case if a

571
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:51,079
 Once I notice that not having a case let's say they don't have a case and how

572
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:57,500
 How would it be in that process? Let's say that this website does not initially give you

573
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,579
 take into account if you have any other alternative of being able to report that

574
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:06,790
 vulnerability well if this I have also consulted

575
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:13,529
 with the guys from the hacker space the moneries that I showed today that I report

576
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:19,359
 when I found it and made a whole document explaining why it was so

577
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:25,808
 serious this and I sent it by mail to one that I found and also what I did was

578
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:32,950
 find my privacy terms and conditions of this site read all and see

579
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:38,589
 with whom we met then what I did was put in the mail obviously with

580
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:43,440
 I always respect and explaining that they were not

581
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,430
 complying with the data protection law they did not comply with some points of

582
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:51,149
 their terms and conditions that made them comply even the page had a

583
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:57,630
 sticker of referring to a page of the nation referring to them

584
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:05,430
 They comply with all this of the habeas data law so well what I did

585
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:11,160
 It was to do well in the mail all the vulnerabilities and they answered me I do not know

586
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,799
 Yes, after three days that in less than 24 hours that will be corrected but I

587
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,040
 for a matter of time I think I did not try again to see if they had

588
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,089
 fixed not in fact even in these vulnerabilities were they were

589
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:29,730
 implied two entities then one intimate to the other so that it is corrected

590
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:36,450
 but what I had checked after a couple of months and that kept going

591
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:42,078
 the same and I said it cannot be, please correct it, it is serious, you can search

592
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,020
 information of this we can look for entry times of

593
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:53,940
 leaving a school as a child if everything was serious and as of today it is corrected

594
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,980
 They assured me that it was already I tried it and in fact it is corrected perfect well

595
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:05,520
 We have some more questions, I do not know we are in time if you have not asked me in

596
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,170
 in case they don't answer you well this is one of the hacker guys

597
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,580
 styles I think we exhibited had told me that what could be done was to go back

598
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:21,029
 insist and if they did not tell us anything, the good ones start looking for other means and

599
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:25,890
 average really and make one day warn that one is going to be a hard disk that is to say

600
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:31,350
 to publish a vulnerability in case that it is not wanted to correct try

601
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:38,410
 or test are options the last options that exist for example for

602
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:44,140
 to know in a fishing for example it is an anti fiction page it seems to me that

603
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:52,009
 calls that one can state the fact of fact

604
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:57,350
 some reported well yesterday my sister battery did not give me the time that for

605
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:01,850
 Please see this page and I managed to see a couple of things

606
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,819
 [Music] and that is important to report to

607
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,210
 anti phishing l do I think it is the account on twitter can report

608
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,810
 our cases send the url privately which is the one you

609
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:20,080
 is doing the trick so that they report it and dismiss it great

610
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,210
 a rather interesting question let's say it has ever happened that

611
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:29,520
 have a good contrast opened in a pen test and

612
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,520
 interesting

613
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:38,779
 if he happens to me when I like to participate in the

614
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:45,260
 'barones' tips in the search for evax and if it happens to me that sometimes I am two weeks

615
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,390
 and I can not find anything but there well it is more logical because it is a very

616
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:53,690
 big and there are other people who are also finding durability then

617
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,839
 It is basic layers that have already been found so I have to go in other ways

618
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:01,009
 So it doesn't happen to me that there are times when I didn't find anything but on a bridge

619
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:06,019
 from which we have worked if it has happened to me that sometimes we find few

620
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:11,799
 things are pretty good so good it may happen that I don't know

621
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,000
 find nothing we always try to find something but

622
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,349
 I have made remember that a system will never be free of vulnerabilities

623
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:26,410
 but even if it is the basic ones, let's try to ensure that they are not what we did good

624
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:31,359
 The last question and with this we end is how you see the demand for the service of

625
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,799
 pentes in the province of córdoba or in the city of córdoba

626
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,270
 as you see it you see it will grow you see it remains as it was in the

627
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:46,210
 In recent years I think it is growing and also thanks to these movements

628
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:52,420
 What happened to the hacker space I see more interested people who want to get involved if it is

629
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:58,570
 It is true that here in Córdoba there is not so much offer of positions related to security

630
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:05,410
 or there are companies that do not know or do not incorporate security equipment because

631
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:10,480
 for a question that is not budget it is true that in Cordoba there

632
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,820
 There is as much offer as in Buenos Aires in Buenos Aires I think it is the cradle of

633
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,620
 all but I think it will continue to grow

634
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:28,720
 I do not think it is something that is so much and good terrific then

635
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,350
 well thank you very much for your time and well

636
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,970
 we continue with the next talk
