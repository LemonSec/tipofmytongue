1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,600
hello good afternoon everyone we are here already in the last talk of

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,290
 of the event this time we have the pleasure of being with Maria on average

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,140
 taurine she is a systems engineer received

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,970
 at the ute n in córdoba he has a master's degree in software engineering from the

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:28,060
 Carnegie Mellon University of Silicon Valley This time it comes to us

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,330
 to talk about the youth safety athletes being a point

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,299
 surely many can when to do it if we are a software operation

8
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:42,580
 free and open source good maría emilia ahead with your talk good

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,199
 thank you very much listen to me well

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,330
 If I did not want to say that there is something else that I am and that is that I am a witness of the moment that

11
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,449
 counted at the opening of the meeting of chicho and marcos in black hat seo also

12
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,920
 was there and share some beers with them some crowns to see las vegas ago

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,300
 about two or three years it seemed fun to share them with you

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,570
 also at that time was in mcafee

15
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,100
 but hey now I'm in canonical, what is the company behind asked?

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,800
 As the saying goes, Maria Emilia, everyone is in Las Vegas.

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,909
 can you see the lights look good

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,000
 they still don't know how to dictate

19
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,260
 now yes

20
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:03,300
 as well as I told you before, the idea of ​​this talk is

21
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,270
 share a bit of what we do in the canonical security team

22
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,470
 ubuntu particularly me for almost a year that i am not long ago and the truth

23
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,120
 that before I could only get to imagine what the team of

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,350
 security of an operating system such as ubuntu if what kind of

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,560
 information they manage how they work day to day where they work and the truth was

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,760
 that I am on this other side I found it super interesting to be able to share it with

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,410
 all of you and also remind you in case you do not know that we

28
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,359
 we interact a lot with the community the knitting community is very large and

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,550
 we make a lot of use for our day to day and to be able to generate everything we do

30
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,330
 community contributions then in a way it is also a

31
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,860
 invitation for all those who still do not know much about the subject and are interested and

32
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,489
 want to participate because it really is a way for me to enter

33
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,299
 let's all keep doing better and better far from being a talk

34
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,099
 commercial if a lot of people second a lot of people to base wear it nato shorts of

35
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,760
 tensioner energies and a good way to return all of that is also

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,810
 contributing and making them better together so I hope they stay with some

37
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,219
 little things throughout the talk that serve as pointers and at least

38
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:26,060
 they start to get in and then they will realize that they are going to be attracted

39
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,000
 to begin with, some of you have probably read notes like

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,739
 this is something that happened less than two months ago for a we had is an event that

41
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,750
 It is carried out every year for many years, that is, years as part of a

42
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,269
 initiative to say it from there that basically connects researchers from

43
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,769
 vulnerabilities privately with vendors in this case canonical and

44
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:57,190
 representing ubuntu but apple microsoft oracle and the

45
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,819
 The idea is precisely to have a space without the intention of criticizing or judging bad

46
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:09,548
 practices but to privately find vulnerabilities and in some way

47
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,890
 way also to reward the researchers for that work that is worthy and that best

48
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,889
 have to have knowledgeable intelligent creative minds that help in a way

49
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,240
 on the good side and have a prize as you can see there

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,759
 mind football is smiling after it found a vulnerability that

51
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,539
 will allow ruth to be scaled on some versions of ubuntu stocks and maybe a

52
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:40,840
 little of the pride of having achieved it perhaps a little more realizing the cake

53
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,359
 silver as you can see what I was getting if you want to know more or less

54
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,650
 of how the event was I leave the link to the podcast our team of a

55
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,388
 fellow road from australia every week was a podcast also that

56
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,159
 account in which we walk, what vulnerability we are initiating, what is happening in the

57
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:04,659
 community and my two teammates who participated in this event that this

58
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:08,740
 year it was online, always in person, but well, everything

59
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,569
 is happening in the world was done online and I think it is interesting that the

60
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,580
 listen to themselves to tell how all this was if something important to

61
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,020
 mention although yesterday the news see how good it was ubuntu actually

62
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,909
 the vulnerability that was found belonged to the linux kernel and that

63
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:30,789
 meant he was talking about a vulnerability that

64
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:36,430
 it affected not only this but ubuntu server and many other linux distributions

65
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,220
 that are based on that version of the card that was vulnerable yes imagine

66
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,570
 for a second what does that mean we're talking a lot probably

67
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,320
 application services that are running linux servers of these

68
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,699
 affected distributions and how important it is to be able to handle this information from

69
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,389
 a correct way because if this information is not in the hands of the people,

70
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:06,099
 It can be very dangerous if specifically here this this was on the 20th and 20th of

71
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:11,380
 March more or less on March 30 we published from Ubuntu the

72
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,000
 new version of the card in which updated up to one idea each

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,789
 obviously every other of the distributions that were affected

74
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:25,680
 they will handle updates and publications according to their processes

75
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,990
 but hey, we in particular did it on the 30th

76
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,260
 And this I mean with what does it mean to handle updates of points here

77
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:42,300
 Besides from here on in this in particular I'm going to lower the talk

78
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,159
 and I would like to clarify a term in case

79
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:52,199
 many do not know that it is something that is highly used in the domain of

80
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,479
 security that yes it is the civilian and the civilian is an acronym means as a

81
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,119
 vulnerabilities and exposures follow as a list as a great base of

82
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:08,610
 vulnerabilities that have become the framework to be able to identify

83
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,969
 somehow all the vulnerabilities it publishes

84
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:17,039
 publicly they are being discovered and thus in turn as a source from which

85
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,149
 There are other services and other projects that work this is cool I received this

86
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,479
 led by miter which is a non-profit organization from the usa

87
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,949
 that has a lot of support from the US government and every time a

88
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:35,759
 vulnerability right now I am showing you the vulnerability that is

89
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,550
 published for the back of the linux kernel that I mentioned earlier is

90
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,210
 assigns a unique identifier building as you see is yes

91
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,729
 in the year of publication and then a unique identifier number a brief

92
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:56,190
 description there that you know is not read but far away hunter for those who do not know

93
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,259
 How can they enter these civilian lists so that they can access and see that a

94
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,030
 minimal description of what that vulnerability consisted of along with some

95
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,669
 public references yes from ubuntu security team every day

96
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,310
 of the year we handle civilians

97
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,720
 before continuing with the issue of vulnerabilities or security I liked

98
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,130
 tell them for those who do not know what point to point really means is

99
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,770
 an ancient African word and means humanity to others who really

100
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,059
 It is described with that phrase I am why we are

101
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,579
 and I believe that in what is the computer environment the distribution of linux

102
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,350
 ubuntu somehow wants to represent that spirit if there is a

103
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,900
 very large ubuntu community that not only uses it but also contributes to

104
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,510
 make it better and better and with this good we not only use things but

105
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:04,779
 Together we can make them better and together we can benefit from all this.

106
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,080
 In particular, I also find it important to clarify that one point is

107
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,860
 known as one of the safest operating systems I do not try

108
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,110
 sell them anything I think the reputation has been built up over time

109
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,540
 even january i am relatively new to ubuntu and ubuntu security

110
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,010
 provides them and a link to a study with an assessment made by the

111
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,080
 US government a couple of years ago but I think it's still interesting

112
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,570
 because it tests ubuntu against about 10 or 11 additional operating systems on

113
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,160
 different areas and explain why you consider Ubuntu to be one of the

114
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,890
 safer operating systems what I can tell you from the inside

115
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,630
 is that this is neither coincidence nor coincidence if there are two large areas

116
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,710
 that I would like to tell you is much more than I could tell you in this

117
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,550
 bit even I think I still need to learn a lot to

118
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,410
 feel secure in everything that I can tell you if I can tell you that

119
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,579
 basically a lot of things that we do proactively from the

120
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,330
 team from what is the garden in the system

121
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,000
 operational there is a continuous planning, design and implementation of all those that

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,210
 are the features that are being implemented in the card and in the

123
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,430
 packages and there I also leave a link for you to see because we are talking about a

124
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,910
 heap of themes and how they evolve along the ruices

125
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,770
 in what way are they enabled or not if we have team members who are

126
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,600
 very focused on all that area we have all the part of code reviews

127
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,320
 although it seems obvious let's say I am not only referring to the reviews of

128
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,070
 code of the different projects or solutions that form a match together

129
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,830
 if obviously that exists we interact a lot with internal teams but

130
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,020
 also in case you do not know the packages together we could basically say that

131
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,110
 There are two great places from which when you get an appetite you get it

132
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,610
 packages in addition to those who can consult that

133
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,269
 they are part of the operating system if we have what is main and what is and

134
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,829
 universe packages that are in main canonical ubuntu commits to

135
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,930
 maintain them and the packages that are in universe are managed by the community

136
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:33,170
 so when there are packages that want to move from universe to main like

137
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,519
 canonical as a point we want to make sure that this code has a certain

138
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,660
 certain quality from many aspects and from the point of security for later

139
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,250
 we keep them if this process is called main inclusion review if we have

140
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,850
 a person from our team who spends all day writing code in a

141
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,899
 bunch of different programming languages ​​with safety head to

142
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,160
 give him what there is that from now on we keep them as part of

143
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,069
 what is maintenance after we have everything that is

144
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:06,449
 threat modeling I put it in Spanish but most likely many of you

145
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:13,400
 know the term set model yes it sounds like many things but basically it is

146
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,170
 an activity and it can be implemented in many ways too but what better

147
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,110
 to model threats think like attackers make a kind of game

148
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,820
 internally and think like attackers for us to detect vulnerabilities

149
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,320
 before a person with bad intentions carried if clearly we are

150
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,370
 few in the security team and we cannot know the universe of all

151
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,850
 internal company projects as codified or implemented

152
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,440
 So what we do is we get together and we really collaborate with the teams

153
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,570
 for the day at the end of the day to define risks that is what it is to understand in

154
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,140
 they are the ones who know the most how everything works and we

155
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,240
 there we ask questions that trigger these potential problems dating a

156
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,710
 list of risks and from then on continue with the planning of how the

157
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,610
 products and projects can evolve we also do many of the 'tablet'

158
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,800
 tops exercises which is to play simulate type a fire drill and we go

159
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,819
 imagine but and there is a package that is making us

160
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,019
 become mining in the repositories what we do how we do what processes

161
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:26,750
 We have to react quickly and effectively so that users do not

162
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,430
 are affected we also have internal training

163
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,599
 that is, all the people who join the company go through some courses

164
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,830
 that have to do with good software architecture and design practices

165
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,640
 depending on the roles they have so we also do it from our

166
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,740
 team and also every month we carry out are called

167
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,839
 when we all get together here we will all be together we have open that they have

168
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,560
 to do with doubts that they have of what they are seat that they ask us good

169
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,609
 practices or it is simply let's talk about what is happening in the community and

170
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,290
 finally all the security testing that again this is all a huge area

171
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,219
 imagine that we are talking about a lot of levels of abstraction in what

172
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,699
 What is an operating system and the different architectures?

173
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:19,109
 client server issues things that are can be tested with provided and

174
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,949
 concepts on a machine or can be tested in the clearing because there is no

175
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:27,719
 problem very complicated issues that it is very important to have devices

176
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,939
 isolated and reproduced by what we call them of vulnerability

177
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:36,930
 protected in a way that again that is so that it does not fall into the hands of

178
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,059
 the wrong people very high level what security

179
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:45,350
 creative however the focus of what they most want us to enter now is what

180
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,279
 we call it continuous security what does the vulnerability of

181
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,290
 happen and i don't mean just linux carmel or canonical products like

182
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,179
 I previously told them canonical as a boom party, you keep dozens of

183
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:03,889
 thousands of packages that are in maine and that you install that you use and

184
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,399
 really if we don't have a process to be able to work on these

185
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,389
 vulnerabilities against the universe of so diverse packages that exist would be

186
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:15,280
 unmanageable remember this little drawing on some slides

187
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,620
 later I'm going to pick it up again

188
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:26,459
 Another clarification if he is going to focus on what vulnerability is is the

189
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:31,238
 ubuntu security is much more than correcting a few skills yes

190
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:36,350
 not because they use on a tour or because they develop their question or because they do

191
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,689
 an application that runs on ubuntu is that application will be safe if

192
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,569
 doing software development architecture infrastructure implies

193
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:49,128
 much more I invite you to search even because of explosion

194
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,759
 in a popular nucleus they will also always do a model of

195
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,879
 responsibility with the game there are a lot of issues to be taken into

196
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,259
 Note if during the previous talks I mentioned myself in several things about this

197
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:06,019
 atmosphere is very big yes however again what I am going to tell you now is

198
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:09,739
 a small part that has to do with security updates

199
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:13,910
 to correct vulnerable software packages there is also a link

200
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,139
 to a blog that is short but can give you a couple of ideas what I mean

201
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:22,329
 so they understand a little better

202
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,410
 if you remember when I told you that it was civil if this list of vulnerabilities

203
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,900
 who is behind the framework I received is miter and I find it interesting

204
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,670
 share this graph with you this is the evolution of the amount of

205
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,930
 vulnerabilities that have been published publicly per year after

206
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,900
 you imagine the number of private projects and vulnerabilities

207
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,030
 that exist that are not publicly communicated regardless of removing

208
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,439
 I don't know how to understand the curve, let's get into statistics, I think broadly speaking

209
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,800
 we can see that there has been a fairly large evolution over time and that if

210
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,250
 for example we focus on the last year and we see that there were more than 12,000

211
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,990
 published vulnerabilities that means that without counting the weekends

212
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,780
 and on holidays there were roughly 30-40 vulnerabilities published per day

213
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,410
 So it seems a second from the side of which we're this side trying to

214
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,220
 fix vulnerabilities it is necessary to have a working scheme

215
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,420
 because if not that is really unmanageable if you want to do it well

216
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,530
 us back on ubuntu on the security team every day

217
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:37,040
 we work with vulnerabilities in addition to all the other things

218
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,879
 I also refer you to a blog that one of my colleagues wrote that

219
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,940
 lives in australia that indicates that on average we publish more than three

220
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,460
 security updates per day and the most critical vulnerabilities we

221
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,260
 we make sure to correct them within 24 hours obviously to reduce the

222
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,870
 impact of whether the skill unit is public that someone can actually

223
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,909
 exploit the general xi and generate damage

224
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,880
 then, how do we do

225
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:17,428
 and I put in part in part let's have that structure speed cadence

226
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:22,120
 consistency really is thanks to the processes

227
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,729
 automation sachets that the team has been generating and improving throughout

228
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,890
 of the time as I mentioned ubuntu ago not ago

229
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,150
 20 years that exists if you do not know me I told you no but well

230
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,330
 and the reality that one learns continuously one is learning to

231
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,510
 As technology evolves, what new packages are going

232
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,050
 appearing attackers more or less have certain patterns of

233
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,080
 behavior but also with technology to do new things

234
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,280
 then if you don't have these processes and they are continually being refined

235
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,540
 it really is unmanageable now I'm going to tell you a little more in detail what

236
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,600
 I mean by this, however, it also seemed important to clarify and this is

237
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,129
 a personal thought but I particularly am a person who to me

238
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,410
 It motivates me a lot and it inspires me a lot to work with people who know a lot and are

239
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,510
 what I feel every day from these people I work with

240
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,410
 there are people who are on the team since ubuntu started then for example

241
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:31,150
 if you have any questions about the ubuntu firewall you can speak directly with the

242
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,800
 person who created it, yes because that person is part of my team and they

243
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,570
 I say if they have because really you can do it too, the team is

244
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,550
 the front has exposed, let's say, that you contact us later

245
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,930
 I am also going to give you a reference of where you can locate us and really if

246
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,660
 have any questions there will be someone from the team who will

247
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,400
 answering will give them context will give them information

248
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,810
 in the same way that I feel that it exists continuously as part of the

249
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,080
 evolution of the team I believe that those who do a lot are on the team

250
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,050
 they are making us new ones continually grow with them so don't

251
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:17,600
 it seemed better to stop mentioning it so that more or less they understand that

252
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,418
 I am talking to you, we are not 300 people, we are not 23

253
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:26,259
 we are 23 people who are distributed in 7 time zones

254
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:32,169
 different this is interesting because if you think a little it's like

255
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:35,799
 practically given the geographical distribution

256
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,350
 we are 24/7 working on the security of one if I am the only one in

257
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,658
 Cordoba of the security team but in Cordoba we are three people and not

258
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:50,559
 I remember and in Argentina I think we are more or less days we all work in

259
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,559
 remotely even before this whole world situation and also the

260
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:03,309
 tint of the difference of languages ​​and nationalities of cultures also

261
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:09,789
 makes having a very important diversity in order to speak with the

262
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:13,600
 community clearly the ubuntu community is both the world and having

263
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,529
 people that we can interact with and that we understand our point of view of

264
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:23,159
 languages ​​but how we really work is quite important

265
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,000
 well if you remember this graphic I had put it earlier when you name more or

266
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,860
 unless for sure now I am going to enter the process that has to do with

267
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,959
 very large bouquet security updates to fit this idea

268
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,010
 we do this trias first because all this amount of vulnerabilities

269
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:48,230
 that I told you that they are published daily we have to understand that

270
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,910
 affects ubuntu not clearly not everything that is published affects ubuntu or

271
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,230
 the distributions that we are maintaining yes and it is assigned a

272
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,410
 priority of that is derived later as is the lack of work what

273
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,070
 vulnerabilities we grasp like fiction or if we make sure that

274
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,179
 we are not only fic being the beautiful way but we are not there where a new

275
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,930
 regression probably all they are hearing in some way are

276
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,940
 associated with software development and when you put a code probably

277
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,750
 break something else let's say then you have to have a structure too

278
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,059
 robust enough to help us do the process correctly

279
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,710
 and finally publishes the publication that also and engineering around the

280
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,730
 publishing so that new versions of the files can be published.

281
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:44,139
 ubuntu and you can have the updates immediately

282
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:51,260
 then if you remember there are three great processes, first of trias, the trias that

283
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,210
 means analyzing vulnerabilities to determine if they affect us at a tone that

284
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,130
 be due to me together are affected and I collect all the information

285
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:06,890
 we may have to work on that vulnerability later if there is

286
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:13,400
 three great sources that are like the main and every day of the

287
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,950
 week on a rotating basis we each of the 24 who work in the

288
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,070
 team we do what is called process and I saw if it is understand affect or not pointed

289
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:32,330
 give them a priority and in turn bring them to our civis ubuntu repository

290
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,179
 to public information and private information

291
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,560
 remember there are moments like cleavage when vulnerability is discovered

292
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,500
 from the carnal we needed to bring to our base of

293
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,700
 data for all that it means to patch that information but not

294
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,970
 we could automatically put in the public repository because if it wasn't

295
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,820
 available to everyone like this

296
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,629
 3 are the great sources from which we make civil dates

297
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,509
 miter you have a peace then we bring all the units

298
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,429
 that are published and after this the national some era ability data you see

299
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:12,500
 that he is a tennis player that is another organization of the United States of the United States government that

300
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,600
 It is basically based on the civil framework but it is quite enriching to have

301
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,428
 have issues such as operating systems this if there are available

302
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,990
 the vendors that are involved then obviously all that information

303
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,250
 which also helps us to try to reduce as much as possible the

304
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,200
 understanding that we have to have if it affects a new taste then come the

305
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,019
 they owed this security and assessment you can also subscribe if you

306
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,350
 are interested in these distributions of see a lot

307
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,070
 extradition of the new ones based on debian then for us it is very

308
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,330
 important things that should already be investigated and analyzed because we also

309
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,689
 It serves as information to us, however the information is not so

310
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,220
 structured so that we can run a writing and that's it.

311
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,640
 updates our database really for that on a rotating basis and

312
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,170
 and with enough knowledge of the dozens of thousands of packages that exist

313
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:18,880
 and that I told them that we keep doing every day for good

314
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,780
 understand where we stand on a day-to-day basis with regard to vulnerabilities

315
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,940
 public that are leaving and non-public also from other sources that

316
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,850
 Yes they are published and something else is very important here a priority is assigned

317
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,709
 because as I told you the amount of vulnerabilities is unmanageable then

318
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,220
 the strategy we have in ubuntu is to fix the most vulnerable vulnerabilities

319
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,490
 important first and for that we have to assign a priority

320
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,249
 The strategy is not crazy, but it is understanding given a vulnerability that

321
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:59,139
 We are seeing if what ubuntu installations apply we are talking about that

322
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:03,218
 role we are talking only about this that we are talking about a tutor and

323
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:09,999
 Ayotte devices and if added to the risk of vulnerability if

324
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:14,889
 is exploited what is the damage that can generate at greater risk the greater

325
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:18,758
 number of ubuntu installations highest priority and least amount

326
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,589
 of affected users and minor effects has lowered me in significant with more

327
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:27,849
 less the amount of information we can have if it is back

328
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:31,918
 priority ensures that we can correct the most important issues

329
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,919
 First

330
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,340
 then those theories if we bring the civilians from all sources that

331
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,779
 I counted on reducing the ones that do not affect us, we prioritize and then we have the

332
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,310
 list of all civil that we have to fix

333
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,720
 all practically all team members do civil and pacho

334
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,300
 meaning civil and pachin is eventually given a version of a

335
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,570
 package that is vulnerable and given the vulnerability that is knowledgeable

336
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:08,409
 public we try to generate a new version of the package that pixar that

337
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,080
 vulnerability if now as I mentioned car I am a systems engineer love it

338
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,760
 software engineering and for me this is a process we are going to

339
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,570
 tell you beautiful software engineering because really

340
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:28,059
 It is the first time that I did my first parts I decided and said by God this

341
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,950
 receives the first one how much is going to happen and why this because you imagine that

342
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,779
 Those dozens of packages that I told you about are packaged in the format of well

343
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:41,919
 so that they run on ubuntu and you install them if with apt install by

344
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,130
 example but every developer in his app repository without the formula he does

345
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,080
 your package imagine using the programming language of your choice

346
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,820
 if the packages are written in python s in more weeks in go or in java

347
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:06,340
 so wanting to fix a package is not just running a command one

348
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,340
 you have to understand which package is fixing what is the purpose of that

349
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,980
 package what is the security vulnerability

350
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,399
 that you imagine the universe you all that are in this talk of

351
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,629
 somehow they manage even a security area and they know that the domain is

352
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:23,949
 enormous then understand vulnerability and how that vulnerability

353
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:29,850
 manifests itself on the package and then make sure that when one

354
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,040
 fixes the vulnerability is really fixed and that in addition some rough

355
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,909
 pieces of code not from a package written by another packaged in format

356
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:44,550
 see how you ensure that that package continues to function correctly not only

357
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,889
 from the point of view again of fix and to the gomera bis of the vulnerability but

358
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,910
 also that we do not break a functionality that works before

359
00:28:53,910 --> 00:29:00,570
 correctly if I invite you to read on the subject of what is good

360
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,610
 packaging because again is is is something that I will not get to cover now but

361
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,280
 So in the team what my teammates have done is quite big, let's say

362
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,500
 because this dates from the experience in which they have tried to come

363
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,330
 working fixing vulnerabilities basically I can risk that what

364
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,189
 Two bags are used, one created by the team, which is one and the other, which is from

365
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,470
 open source called win that what they allow is to facilitate that gives us a

366
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,030
 package bring code and apply patches generate

367
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,920
 a new version when publishing it with some internal things like that so that we

368
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,480
 allow our machines to function as repositories to grab other

369
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,210
 machines and we bring the update and do back validations yes so that

370
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,990
 understand me about the challenge I want to tell you an example that happened to me that I did

371
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,760
 a month that within canonical I was just in the ramp stage and appeared

372
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,990
 a version of docker that had to be patched but that needs to be done back by

373
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,360
 the bar by is also a quite interesting concept because because

374
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,159
 ubuntu obviously that is a single point concept in an icon but you will

375
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,530
 What does he do, let's say everything every six months and good in release and every two years

376
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:24,120
 these releases is that they are maintained for nine months every six months but

377
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,439
 every two years it generated a version of the 10 probably those who have known for a long time

378
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,960
 The 2004 version came out a little, which will be kept for 5 years

379
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,149
 and when a version is generated at that time it is brought so to speak it has

380
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:43,439
 very high level the latest version in action of the package but as they go

381
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,059
 evolving in which they are continuously updated against upstream if

382
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,250
 only the comics are brought the patches that have to do with fixing

383
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,390
 problems that interest us as part of boot maintenance

384
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:03,570
 So in this field for example I was added was the vulnerability of the

385
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,830
 2 out of 2 that I said, well, I took it, it seemed challenging to learn a

386
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,928
 little more and the pablo run and made with a web unit his country for those who

387
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:16,350
 know is a small package in python it was quite simple the vulnerability me

388
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,439
 lets understand the whole process good ok

389
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,700
 how many people used coal the truth i can say i think

390
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,299
 all the things that could have happened to me happened to me in the first place I grabbed

391
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:33,120
 the information available as told them to cool down together a lot of

392
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,668
 information then okay play yes fast fast play was a

393
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:43,980
 script site that obviously had file addresses and a few things to educate that

394
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,100
 allowed to reproduce some stability in which through a

395
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,209
 educate pep command could be written with root privileges in the

396
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,410
 host there was one to her well then I believe my machine

397
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,030
 virtual with that version which is the a 1703 obviously and I also keep it for myself

398
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,389
 I will remember my whole life I will run it for my first

399
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,520
 experience say good I reproduce the vulnerability did not speak turns out to do

400
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,610
 that the vulnerability had been discovered later and obviously

401
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,290
 It affected not only that vulnerability that we were talking about touching 18 and something

402
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,460
 rather the code was back vulnerable also however testing

403
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,550
 concept used educating technologies that when I wanted to use them in this version of

404
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:38,500
 educate 1703 did not exist so I had to rewrite the proof of concept that

405
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,060
 someone from the community had written back to this about how they help us

406
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,190
 You from the community did have to rewrite it because you didn't

407
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,480
 I could reproduce in a specific need that we had from ubuntu of

408
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,779
 make a bar because of that humidity and well, I managed the network, I wrote perfect

409
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:03,500
 under the code if the soft for this point 1704

410
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,840
 grabbed the patch that was back written by the community if most

411
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,139
 patches are often written by the community so we

412
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,660
 makes it much easier to move with what I already told you that involves being at

413
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,520
 Friday some skills I'm going to apply the patch that command

414
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,930
 kuyt which is also an open source program that given the source code in

415
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:33,930
 ok packages one can try to click import import the patch

416
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:39,529
 all red, that is, the files that the patch played in the

417
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:46,159
 version 17 03 that I wanted to sign had varied a lot, yes because for

418
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,179
 the unit and thus it was found that not then the patch was made for here in

419
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:54,400
 Austin but we need to go back to the previous versions

420
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,620
 so well with patience and soap to see what happens I was one of the classes that

421
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,389
 were involved there were methods that had been clearly factored from

422
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,949
 that s & p a while ago that establishes a new avenue function I found more or

423
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,819
 less where the problem came from, rewrite all this what is

424
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,460
 written in go the truth that throughout the 12 years that I work I have worked

425
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,380
 with more compact themes with javascript with a lot of technology with go there was no

426
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,960
 never worked then it was common it is also to roll up my sleeves that is to say good

427
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,489
 today is go tomorrow that would be is not true as again the dozens of

428
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,658
 thousands of packages each one knows how the practices that each are written

429
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:43,070
 one is still not good so I managed for the

430
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,399
 files that had to do with the affected classes fix them

431
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,308
 I also see that very applied to the person who made the patch there was also

432
00:34:53,309 --> 00:35:00,089
 added as part of the patch and excellent unitas not only fixed it for you but

433
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:04,259
 I give you units that allow me to ensure that what I am doing functions

434
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,210
 obviously imagine what happened not only that they did not run what had happened

435
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:16,260
 is that docker after version 1703 had created a new solution a new

436
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,539
 framework a new project of witnesses we are going to call it then these files

437
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:26,099
 Juni test modified to add new tests did not even exist

438
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:32,490
 in version 17 03 this is me but I can't generate the new version without these

439
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:37,319
 johnny test and geo good 2 jail p is from before there has to be in the

440
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:41,609
 previous framework of the package that I am fixing other tests even if more

441
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:46,348
 or less try to test these classes clearly you know docker poker

442
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:51,779
 it has a quite this is as part of its package and well that's how it happened

443
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:56,310
 I found I found the tests great so I said good tiki tiki

444
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:01,420
 whatever they do I'm going to run them but this is a godó project and the

445
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,160
 text project uses bagotes which is a good library in the version of the

446
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,118
 tests in the patch used some commands from the

447
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,380
 go test bookstore that the version of hotels that I was passing did not have

448
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,900
 so I had to understand that those functionalities did that to

449
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,260
 rewrite them here is possible counting let's see

450
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,890
 I already meant that it can be quite an adventure because this was given that

451
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:36,400
 it was a vulnerability of a concrete situation but again of the dozens of

452
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,100
 thousands of packages this can really be

453
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,279
 Each a different adventure, however I love it in engineering

454
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,760
 software and when I did the publication and I said wow like that I come now not

455
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,930
 I invite you to do so because all these foreign Turks are unthinkable

456
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,799
 or that you can install in test development environments

457
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,010
 help us find vulnerabilities and help us in this process to

458
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,290
 our attraction products and you take but say easy but if you can help us

459
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:14,119
 fast forward latest is post

460
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,009
 not that we just carry the new version

461
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:25,160
 to the ubuntu files and voila we also have a lot of your quotes that we

462
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,118
 help automatically with some templates to generate the communications

463
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,309
 you can subscribe to that mailing list and you will receive every time

464
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:38,630
 that any of us or every day at least three per number of arrivals per

465
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:45,120
 Now it is at the speed that we have the fix versions, there is already a minimum

466
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,339
 description at a level of abstraction sufficient for it to be understood is not

467
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:56,040
 very technical there are references for those who want to understand later what is that

468
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,170
 what is affected how can they be to do to update their systems

469
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,430
 what I am showing you there is the uss in which it is ubuntu if you want it has artist

470
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:11,069
 which was released on March 30th for the linux kernel vulnerability which

471
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,810
 I commented to them at the beginning of the talk and finally what happens when

472
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,460
 we finished making the publications and all the validations that did not finish

473
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,640
 but just imagine all the validations we do for

474
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,319
 make sure we broke things

475
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:33,950
 I was saying after all this happen this publication is

476
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:41,680
 available for everyone to read and basically accessible

477
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,770
 This is just a little drawing that I don't want to go into too much detail because I don't

478
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,700
 is that I have so much time but so that they understand graphically what they

479
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,210
 I was commenting on the ubuntu realizations and why we have to do the

480
00:38:54,210 --> 00:39:00,870
 pack in case every six months if you check them together the names start with

481
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:07,589
 this a number that has to do with the year and then the month 2004 this

482
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:13,710
 It stands out is the one that we released a little while ago that will have the support not only the

483
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,720
 common but the extended one that also exists for that reason there is already like one of the

484
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,439
 ways Canonical makes money that beyond five years of

485
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,140
 support that are established if there is, for example, a company that has

486
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,489
 a server that happens for example 1404 that means a distribution of

487
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:36,630
 ubuntu that is created in 2014 but because they have a critical service and not

488
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,439
 they want to update the system but if they want to have the updates no

489
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:45,058
 only security but also in general can subscribe and good that

490
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,209
 is what is called the program and they do in our team we do the

491
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:52,720
 program security updates and do also

492
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,348
 In case I am not sure, the contributions of the community is a

493
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,790
 essential part because I think that I do not have to repeat this again.

494
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,320
 I told, there is not a lot of information there are many of the things we do to

495
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,560
 make sure we do things right and see that there are a lot of little

496
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,859
 places that you can help us because since you asked and see that

497
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:15,310
 sure that ubuntu from the knowledge that you have us

498
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:21,880
 can help to try to get this improvements if in this case the point of

499
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,460
 software from a security point of view but they can do it in

500
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,480
 our aspects too

501
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,508
 specifically involved in security 123 can you ask me how

502
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:38,230
 first of all I think it's late for security

503
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,850
 implies being very curious being proactive the other guys on the tables

504
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,359
 previous ones already told several things that it is a very large area so no

505
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:50,500
 they can understand everything is good that they see that they like that part of everything

506
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,640
 Can you tell them they are interested in it, I think it is a very fascinating mix

507
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,779
 software engineering too and that when you know about software engineering this

508
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,000
 It is a very nice process, join there are the channels that

509
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,839
 He counted where they can contact us we are in irc we are in discord

510
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,950
 we have the twitter account we have the podcast that every week my

511
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,169
 teammate from australia and invites us in fact ago

512
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,520
 little I was leaving if I do not listen to it is not necessary but try to be a little

513
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,520
 fun entertaining not just a boring tutorial

514
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,220
 but to think but also contribution to the base pasta how they can contribute with

515
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,080
 security very small point there is a tuna called launchpad and there

516
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:42,390
 I said the wiki how they have to do it is not what I cared about in this

517
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,200
 in this presentation how can bacteria load a background if you

518
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,370
 You can contribute with the tips what I told you about those patches that we

519
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,839
 take for example is a way and help us to make this whole process of

520
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,890
 give you a security organization be a little more easy

521
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,089
 and well an important part of this is my final message of the ubuntu mission

522
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,690
 is to allow the community to grow and share the experience so that

523
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,920
 we all do according to your best and maybe a message really that I tell them is them

524
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,760
 I'm talking about ubuntu but it grabs the distribution of lines that

525
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,230
 you like it and surely the internal one of each one of the others

526
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,860
 distributions will be different or not this is what I can tell you what we do

527
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,600
 in canonical with ubuntu but grab the instruction that you like the most now

528
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,779
 the best also since they use it and with this I finished just in time I overdid

529
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:41,480
 very good I am an actor must be a little problem I have that we appeared from the

530
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,310
 screen we were a little almond trees with my questions that you

531
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,070
 they had done, we repeat the question

532
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:54,480
 view yes of me if I am someone from the community and I found a catfish security

533
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,820
 How should I report it? I can collaborate the same in the solution if not only that

534
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,930
 they can but they will do the ones along the slides that have them

535
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:09,299
 I left you several pointers from the first wikis that describe not only how they can

536
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,010
 report a bum that there is launchpad that is the blue one we use that they have to

537
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,360
 Throw in that it is a security back but also how you can configure yourself

538
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:26,250
 your development and testing environments if to just do is make sure

539
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,370
 you also of everything you are doing that you are doing

540
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,430
 correctly I invite you to configure the entire weak system of

541
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,509
 should also and if you have any questions obviously contact us in the

542
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,960
 channels that I also told you before if you remember the slide of

543
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,190
 Pazzini in that que távora and everything that happened to me when I wanted, we did not do

544
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,990
 the patch the pack did not contribute to someone in the community if not really

545
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,740
 I remember if there was the same upstream project or not because sometimes that happens

546
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,558
 but there are times that someone from the community gives us the d

547
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:01,619
 and for us that is highly evaluable so not only can they

548
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:10,939
 but let the Aztecs do very well then look here they ask it says

549
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,110
 if there is one there is a way to see if in the ubuntu that I have installed

550
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,000
 I have a security back that they are about to solve or to do something

551
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,820
 kind of general check if I am missing a security update

552
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:32,820
 important if in part to see there is a snap called segis scan that allows

553
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,290
 analyze the system and precisely against the climber to understand if there is

554
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,430
 vulnerability is associated there is another projection is called or bout also

555
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,299
 then to search for references the truth is that it is one add nothing but yes

556
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,140
 There is a space for them to share references in case they forget, then if not

557
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,140
 What has been written to be nowhere, I can share it with you

558
00:44:53,140 --> 00:45:00,460
 the same as the database as I told you about ubuntu from civis is

559
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,609
 I know that there are many projects that

560
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:07,058
 they make their own feeds and they are looking at that is what way we

561
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:11,769
 we do trias which is the first phase of the process and we say if it affects a new

562
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:16,240
 point and what do you do then if you want to create even if what

563
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,479
 The Asturias we have is of no use for whatever you are

564
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,119
 monitoring and want to believe to create something about our track btr feel

565
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,099
 free and again before any question in aller si en les courts where

566
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,400
 want

567
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,129
 well

568
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,420
 e [Music]

569
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,200
 now we have a question more related to the personal says that

570
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,649
 requirements or processes exist to make one of the 23 team members

571
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:50,519
 security good first of all I am a graduate of

572
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:54,558
 the ute n also as I mentioned above

573
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:03,390
 and when she was very young even better in 2007 she did an internship at that time

574
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:08,580
 I was inter in Cordoba and my internship was on web security

575
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,630
 start my experience to work on security and some

576
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,660
 way I really like the combination of the

577
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,680
 security with software engineering particularly I start from there and

578
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,399
 I love to see how where there is a piece of software security is involved and

579
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,920
 it does not matter the language of importing the project it does not matter extraction level

580
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,390
 first then i was always into what

581
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,420
 is security around application development

582
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:40,559
 in 2012 2013 I got a scholarship and did a master's degree and the reality is that

583
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,710
 the person in charge of the canonical security department

584
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,240
 is a person who is interested in people with formal education I will not

585
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,629
 say it is exclusive but yes in my case

586
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:57,850
 that person likes the combination of having worked at companies like intel and

587
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:02,230
 mcafee that as animation previously I was also in marks and mixing

588
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,370
 software engineering safely throughout the 10-12 years I worked but

589
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:10,900
 he also really liked the formal education that he is a bachelor's degree student

590
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:16,450
 systems and having a master's degree in software engineering is also

591
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:21,210
 inclusive but also a little what was talked about always not sometimes not

592
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:27,010
 serving sometimes it is not necessary to have a bachelor's degree whatever

593
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,070
 in some situations in some companies they do not have many values

594
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,910
 degrees and even within a company I think department department

595
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:38,710
 There is also a podcast and some previous editions ago that precisely the

596
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,360
 person who is the director of the area who was the one who hired me with the person who

597
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,080
 makes the podcast which is like the one that is the main tl of the team after we are

598
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,520
 divided into I think we are four sub teams and I am the leading coach of one of

599
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,810
 they have an interesting talk about that, how do you get into the

600
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,180
 security and how do they come to canonical

601
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,890
 and highlighting that highlight the part of education that you have to know engineering

602
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,240
 software to be at least on this side of what we do

603
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,410
 a little there I am installing there is a question that are seven knowledge

604
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:15,359
 are necessary to collaborate with the world

605
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,089
 gathers

606
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:25,100
 in ubuntu with everything I think that again it would be good to focus a little according to

607
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,270
 which area of ​​each one interests you if we are talking about contributing to safety

608
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:34,130
 from ubuntu for me one of the best ways to do it is by getting into

609
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:39,470
 getting into understanding how things work understanding where there may be

610
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,790
 a vulnerability in what software but again scenario as very large

611
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,420
 layers out there that is related a bit in the questions that were

612
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,850
 answering the boys of how one goes to get into security

613
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:56,270
 maybe understand what one likes because it is a lot really is a

614
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,840
 area too large and that is a lot of years that I have been working in

615
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,860
 somehow security and I still feel like there are a ton of topics out there

616
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:10,880
 For example, the part of the card I never did it, I am still right, there is a combination

617
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,840
 of the technology that the vulnerability may be associated with or the area of

618
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,600
 security that we want to somehow make the programming language better

619
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:26,330
 the level of abstraction that interests us so for me this is very personal

620
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,990
 understanding a little of everything a little because you can not go in depth

621
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:35,279
 that an angel is what we like a bit obviously when we like it when

622
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,870
 you are something you like, you get motivated more and on top of that you do something you like and

623
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:45,450
 On top of that, it is helping to improve what others are doing, I think that's where you are

624
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,740
 as more reason still

625
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:52,709
 Yes

626
00:49:54,929 --> 00:50:02,580
 occurring the questions this but they said but also created the

627
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,359
 around the talk I left several pointers on how to get into ubuntu like

628
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:10,259
 contribute 1 point how to contribute to the safety of a you how do you do the

629
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,710
 test development environments like September will be exhibited that if they want

630
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:23,070
 you can be there the gift that you do not find contact us exactly well

631
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:28,470
 It is outside they have to name but the oil is a very important step if

632
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,799
 you eventually want to work on this have that resume that

633
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,700
 contributed ubuntu does not mean ubuntu swim

634
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,730
 because obviously I'm talking for some kind of security point but

635
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:42,640
 we are talking about the security in the local shorts you also want to share

636
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,509
 the process of a you but other companies surely have other processes

637
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:51,550
 also yes then what better that you are also helped him a little for

638
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,770
 after that it serves as a push that they want to get a job from this

639
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:04,930
 of this area and remember the amount of silver that the resort will be more exact

640
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,580
 to review being of vulnerability is also a whole career if one wants

641
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:17,380
 see it there is no money behind all this, see if there is a question here that later

642
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,610
 is interesting says that there are problems that have been decided not

643
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:27,090
 fix because when implementing the solution it broke into other things

644
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:34,130
 I would risk saying that or at least in history that I am not

645
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:40,340
 in any case I know what I would do I would try to correct too

646
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:46,710
 the things that can be broken by the hand of that arrangement

647
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:51,510
 I am trying to think at least only since I am I think he has not touched the

648
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:56,520
 situation to tell them what has happened in history before yes

649
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,869
 we have decided not to fix vulnerabilities because again based

650
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:04,740
 in the prioritization strategy there is not a lot of accessibility what

651
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,790
 they have not yet been attacked for example but it is a matter of priority since

652
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,560
 we are 24 people we are not an infinite number

653
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,359
 and I really have colleagues who do a lot of other things we are not doing

654
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:26,360
 If they spend all day of course, well, look, we are right with him

655
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,660
 time we have some other questions but

656
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,730
 We have to close today's event and thank you very much for your

657
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:42,090
 time the predisposition for having pretended, let's say, to the proposal of

658
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:47,180
 ccoo hacker is asking tn with these talks

659
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,109
 so good thank you very much

660
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,410
 the rest of the people tell them how good that giving thanks so much for

661
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:00,089
 join us for being present today and well do not miss all

662
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:05,190
 the talks that come tomorrow is our last day of the day that we have

663
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:10,220
 organized with the people of the hacker space and the ute n

664
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:16,669
 and well we wait for everyone tomorrow and again thank you very much to my

665
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,100
 all bye

666
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:26,850
