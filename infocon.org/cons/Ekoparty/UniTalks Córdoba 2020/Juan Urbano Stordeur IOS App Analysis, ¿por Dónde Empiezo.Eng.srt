1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
well good morning everyone back welcome to the second and last day of

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,639
 share and university cox and for me it is an immense pleasure to introduce a friend

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,669
 With this excuse, for those who know him in that load, he has to know what he is

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,910
 he

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,450
 picking bile from sharing this but hey he's a known person so

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:33,489
 nothing today base worm will not be delighting with various analyzes by

7
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,900
 where do i start so nothing uses all yours i leave it

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,019
 I leave you with the perfect people, thank you very much

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,420
 how about a good morning I'm going to share

10
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,420
 look, or there it is, we are all seeing the main screen

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,219
 and everything perfect perfect good first of all very good morning and many

12
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,460
 Thank you

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,900
 thank the people who shared the people of the hacker space tn for the

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,650
 opportunity and basically accounting because this

15
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,740
 this title or this to this particular talk

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,780
 basically when they told me who the audience of this talk was for in

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,850
 particular it occurred to me to say good ios analysis or to start analyzing the

18
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,470
 scenario app is and where did i start and this question comes from

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,030
 because many times I have talked to people who tell you I play bounty for

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:44,010
 example but it is not promoted or android ios period no i dont know or even the

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,030
 people from the faculty who are seeing what they can do, those who are not, etc.

22
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,370
 then I said well that sinks in maybe a point of

23
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:59,100
 departure for all the people and well I hope you like it basically thanks

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,500
 matching for the presentation when they are going to extend without wastelands to follow day

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,669
 analysis and for several years I have been dedicating myself to what is the analysis of

26
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,549
 mobile applications then without going any further we will

27
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,380
 start which is where I start and we are going to look at some particular topics that

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,740
 the typical success questions have to do with the initial requirements

29
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,850
 I can not with windows I can with a market cetera

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,890
 how to jailbreak

31
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,410
 the different ways to install apps on a device

32
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,579
 communication with the device and how to do the same from the applications

33
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,140
 etc. what does it mean that an application is

34
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,170
 encrypted in osasuna which is decrypted

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,480
 whether or not it is possible to access the application code

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,590
 what is the analysis of internal information can I access the

37
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,319
 internal information of the application and basically if I can capture traffic or

38
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,010
 is this the least that one should know perhaps

39
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,980
 to be able to start analyzing applications either

40
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,020
 in their jobs that is to do a bartender that etc. then

41
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,190
 what would be the initial requirements a mac in any of its

42
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,520
 variants

43
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,839
 and here the first question but without a mac if there are things that can be done

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,260
 but there are others that will not then issue limitations or will see

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,950
 they won't be able to fully analyze an app if they don't have a brand and

46
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,409
 this is another question is i need an iphone if an iphone with a version of

47
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,090
 jailbreak available that we are going to see and then ready these would be

48
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,209
 the initial steps to start analyzing

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:15,800
 to be able to start making the applications for a minute because I did not activate

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,250
 the camera, thank you, excuse me, no

51
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,540
 is this perfect

52
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:35,550
 perfect I am new to this also speaking via online platform or if you

53
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,960
 I apologize going back a bit is what are the initial requirements

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:47,400
 I mean one more I can if I mark no and an iPhone with a jailbreak version

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,219
 available then that would be what we need then if a client us

56
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:57,659
 says you want to analyze an application or you analyze an application from

57
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:02,580
 any of the pacman platforms you normally will have different

58
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,469
 approaches that one is the static approach and the other is the dynamic one let's go

59
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:11,550
 seeing what this means and I'm going to tell you a little more and the scenario of

60
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,780
 work that this is very important is the client can send us the ipa

61
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,700
 You can send us a test play coyote so that we can download the application and

62
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,190
 Let's analyze or you can tell us to download it from the lawsuit because I want to know how it is

63
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,240
 the security of the application then taking into account these three points

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,740
 let's go talking let's see how to analyze an application in

65
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,810
 Christmas in particular so why do the jailbreak is the first

66
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,260
 asks what should be done and basically this allows the user

67
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,849
 download and install non-anxiety apps that have not been approved by the

68
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:57,760
 habit by app store or by apple and in particular they will be able to download

69
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,480
 applications outside the app store and what does it mean we are going to do a

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,270
 jailbreak to be able to install cydia if I read etc then it lets us access

71
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,640
 other functions and customizations that we will not have access if it were not that

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,099
 We have a cell phone and we because we are interested because

73
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,710
 basically it facilitates us the tasks when it comes to analyzing applications, that is, at the

74
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:30,390
 time to make an application in front of us will facilitate the tasks

75
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,200
 then what is the good thing about having jailbreak that we will have access to

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,740
 internal directories access the kitchen

77
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,600
 we will be able to bypass whatever ls is and remember that I told you

78
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,110
 analyze the traffic then we will be able to access what the memory is

79
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,960
 we will be able to do bar at runtime

80
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,520
 we are going to be able to perform dynamic instrumentation etc. they are different this is

81
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,120
 as the important that we are going to be able to perform a lot of tasks than otherwise

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:09,169
 form we could not understand then how we do a jailbreak we need to

83
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:15,799
 less a device than this I already said know what version of ios you have installed

84
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,470
 so once we know what version of ios you have see what is the jailbreak

85
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,240
 available for said version, it is understood then how we look for the

86
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
 ios version we have our device as the version we will

87
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,360
 which is general information settings and you will see this image in

88
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,069
 particularly if in the device, note that there is where the arrow is

89
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:46,970
 It says software version 12 4 2 if we compare with another device since

90
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,879
 had another is positive what version 11 says 26 are a version a bit

91
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,069
 older but basically we already know what version of devices we have and

92
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:03,270
 Now what we are going to do is see what type of jailbreak exists in

93
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,210
 general terms there are two types that is interest and interest

94
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,659
 So what are you wondering why is that a jailbreak?

95
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:19,359
 temporary that requires to be connected to the computer every time it is restarted

96
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:24,270
 the device if the above is not done so as not to be

97
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,049
 the jailbreak what does it mean that if it restarts we stay in the interim

98
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,120
 basically the device just needs to be connected

99
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,349
 at the initial moment

100
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,610
 when we start when we connect for the first time we jailbreak and now

101
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:49,630
 we have the king and that means that when you restart the device it is not lost

102
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,950
 and this is why this is the most sought after path, it is understood then if we do

103
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,620
 a comparison which we choose and where

104
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,230
 we are going to look for some existing envelopes because we make the version in the

105
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,300
 device we already know that there are two types in particular so let's see a

106
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,670
 site that is very very good called jailbreak channel and because I put this site

107
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:21,769
 because it takes us look there the box that says goodbye version 12.4 and that

108
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,570
 always and crossing to a cover or a cover that is a type of jailbreak once

109
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,699
 a blood type then look there is another that says it was and in

110
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:38,569
 particular this other that claims to be king using the jailbreak using the check rain

111
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,100
 and there it shows us the versions and so on because I show you this site because

112
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,680
 is good and takes you directly is directly to the development site of the

113
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,109
 jailbreak what does it mean there is a lot of site that downloads malware or

114
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,170
 that in particular we are going to finish download them and an application that is not

115
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,149
 the one that we should understand then knowing that the sun is possible

116
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:09,850
 break exist we are going to focus on what is ios for versions 12 2 and

117
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,170
 higher or there are several jailbreak as I will show you mention this

118
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,430
 the chimera that for all devices from version 12 at

119
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:25,779
 12.22 there I put the url to also be able to access and then there is a cover

120
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:31,899
 that I mentioned to you from version 11 to 13.3 lastly check rain that the

121
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:38,040
 sic from iphone 5 s to iphone x versions 12 3 and higher then

122
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,949
 what is the point of all this we need to analyze an application

123
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:47,410
 we are going to always do and we are going to choose the most stable or we are going to test the

124
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,060
 until we stay with one in particular

125
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,430
 so if we do the jailbreak using the rain check what we are going to

126
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,890
 to do is we go to the site we give it download basically we download

127
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,830
 an application that people who say they believe in mg point in this case is for

128
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:14,080
 the squid this milk crane and basically I start the process of

129
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,430
 jailbreak what do I need to do I need to install I need to focus my

130
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,449
 device on the computer basically after what one has to

131
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,870
 to do is to be the process begins and once the process begins

132
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:34,279
 notice that it says our device needs bytes

133
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:40,100
 firmware update when it is basically to prevent any kind of problem

134
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,160
 with the device so that we do not have a paperweight if it is not 500 I do not know or

135
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,209
 an iphone 5 whatever a 78 bake to the font x whatever in the process of

136
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,170
 jailbreak we may be wrong pl is understood

137
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,889
 then continuing what they must do is be

138
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:07,930
 This jailbreak is very messy and they will later compare it with the

139
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,280
 rest and notice that it is great because all you have to do is

140
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,030
 plug in the device recognizes it gives it an image of what device it has

141
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:21,650
 in this case 5 and read start and see what it will look like

142
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,189
 press the button above the middle button because the number of seconds is

143
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,260
 does all the guided jailbreak then begins the process of

144
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,850
 installation and jailbreak then begins according to 'the or if we look

145
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,619
 our device will see that it begins also the same process begins

146
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:44,470
 as we see our computer on the device it will

147
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,179
 happen that is image that is well seeing on the left in particular that

148
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:54,999
 happens when it ends it tells you odón and what happens we see the device and it has

149
00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:01,779
 to be rain and syria, notice that there I remember that when I use check rain

150
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,879
 it no longer installs so automatically it is super stable and normally works on

151
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,050
 the first attempt on the second attempt as which the next thing that would be we open

152
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:17,449
 Syria what is the repository of external sources let's go

153
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,829
 to say it and for example what we can do to search

154
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:27,939
 an ssh software or we can search the device

155
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:34,000
 then I already have installed for example open s ph until

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,490
 we did there were others famous and there were others the king was unique from the first to

157
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:47,350
 etc. then it is installed in the same way, not for that reason I put these questions and

158
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,630
 basically let's follow what the jailbreak is using a color we are going to

159
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,670
 do it in two different ways using impact up url in

160
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,760
 particular is a development of saurik is the same one that created sia

161
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,480
 and then we are going to use another tool called apple sign that

162
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,350
 It was created by pancake and is the creator of radar networks beyond that we are also going to

163
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,940
 see a little of this then we are going to use two tools without factor and

164
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,600
 apple side to install and a and so in this case to do it and

165
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,710
 to check enough then we will need what was

166
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,850
 give you the idea they have to go to the applied site and dotcom create in a

167
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,130
 user associated an email and once they do this they have to select

168
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,570
 specific password what do you mean they will generate a one-time password that the

169
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,420
 again they will use you in the impact then we will download from the site

170
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,329
 official would go to jailbreak channel on this site that I told them look for the site of

171
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,519
 code to download download note that it says eleventh and

172
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,209
 for 4.31 and for no download and basically what we are going to do is

173
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:12,649
 we are going to open impact impact is going to ask us in the movie that we have to

174
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,379
 they said they will not ask us for the password that we generate this password is

175
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:24,800
 the only use and once we do that we give it ok the process of

176
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,939
 installation and we are going to install a cover on our device but look at the

177
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:37,520
 first comparison we can make regarding using che train

178
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,680
 and a cover and power is installed only for this application for

179
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,229
 do the jailbreak and instead a cover we plugged the device to all

180
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:55,160
 the guided installation and check rain was not installed and from one then now this

181
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,439
 It is one more step that we basically opened a cover, notice that it says only 29

182
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,950
 steps of when the exploitation begins and what happens when the

183
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,350
 jailbreak tells you for example exploit hernán and tells you that siria was installed

184
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:18,740
 etcetera these are the 29 steps he performed and then now that we have

185
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,730
 we have our the break we have the application to do the

186
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,680
 jailbreak and sidi to install on our device that we should do what

187
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,370
 same as we did before, for example installing this application is to open yes to

188
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,160
 go to for schulz below everything and added the sources that we are only going to

189
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,709
 continue a little later then ready we have the jailbreak got

190
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,280
 working

191
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,310
 now and to continue a little we are going to use the sankei that would be we are going to

192
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,540
 also install a cover but with another tool and why am I doing this?

193
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,560
 because when you need to analyze applications, you often come across

194
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,899
 this scenario and it is so good to know and also because I want to compare it is something

195
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,099
 in particular a little later then we need a computer with

196
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:16,980
 magicians because because we need a provision profile was worth to use

197
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,240
 in our device and what does it mean we are going to generate it using ex

198
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,929
 code then yes or yes we will need a mac to use this

199
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:33,259
 and we need the paper that was worth it, we already generated it then we have

200
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:37,789
 downloaded list also that we need to install lastly we download

201
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:42,919
 tools and install them once we did all this as analyzed a

202
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:49,430
 double click provision and profile basically you enter the site from here

203
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,790
 to this translate the installation of allows the installation of applications

204
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,020
 for development and distribution it is understood then we are going to generate that

205
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,120
 provision and profile to be able to install an application in

206
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,899
 our device if we use we install atristain as it is a

207
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:11,620
 tool that is cast in the nou we look for it

208
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,529
 they simply deactivate which is the first one they install it and if they do not look for it in 10

209
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:23,279
 hawes mind you all you have to do is run him

210
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:32,470
 the program well sainz javascript point js sorry

211
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,620
 They install April Saint they already have it working and we continue problems or

212
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,550
 I had a little bit on that so what are we going to do let's go to the device

213
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,330
 we log in to our device after we create a project we open

214
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,250
 Sixth look, we created a project in this case I put production to make you

215
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:57,730
 exam and we need to fill in all the details of to create a project

216
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:03,190
 then they will tell us what a user wants to sign with, that is, with Juan

217
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,450
 román or juan I had two here in particular which is the one in the pile and that

218
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,560
 will you generate then there are 18 this that we are going to do with the device

219
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,600
 plugged in we are going to give play to install the application in our

220
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,870
 device and once you have the application installed on our

221
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,280
 device will tell us look there it says that you have to verify in the

222
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,470
 device him but worse certify that is the

223
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,360
 developer certificate [Music]

224
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,740
 associated with this text user is understood or basically we have to

225
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,320
 go to the device and give it trust this is the application

226
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,629
 let's go to profile inside what is baishan management notice what it says ay

227
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,790
 apple développement basically we are going to trust him and one we believe trust we are going to

228
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,149
 have the application installed on our device but for these

229
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,860
 remember that we wanted to reach the

230
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,049
 to provision

231
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,570
 he mobile provision

232
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,370
 look we have to go to products within the cloud we are going to choose the

233
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,449
 folder and there is the sending of the mobile provision

234
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,140
 why are we going to use this because we use it with apple sign to sign the

235
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,910
 application and be able to install it on our device then we think again

236
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,500
 We already have installed look up there and this would be the command line

237
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,490
 basically we called the application we downloaded that was from the cover

238
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:46,850
 let's say integers putting the verb there is provision and notice that it goes with everything it says

239
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,700
 sign the application and the cursor of saint point of view what does it mean

240
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,220
 this that we will be able to use now [Music]

241
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,570
 we will be able to install the application on our device having the signature

242
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:07,470
 given having affirmed with the mobile provision of my xcode user

243
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,600
 then finally what are we going to do we are going to use and install this

244
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,459
 It is a tool that I will show you later on, so you do and

245
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,900
 vice installed they install themselves and they will already have it

246
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,940
 the application on the device understands this as a note is if the

247
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,720
 jailbreak process remember to try again a few times

248
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,570
 why do I say this because a cover is different like other jailbreaks to

249
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,710
 Sometimes they are a little more unstable and you have to do it several times they can lose

250
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,470
 the green gel 'that does not have to be returned to while they are analyzing the

251
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,030
 application remember that the pse is not well done

252
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,370
 blake if when they start silvia they play syria and it closes automatically wants

253
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,649
 say they have no flock and once we have access to the sun and

254
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:06,130
 so we have to go to access add sources to continue with

255
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,070
 the process then what is green would they choose and why

256
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,500
 what or in spirit in my experience h rain is much more stable

257
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,400
 after they actually use to install

258
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,280
 impacts in saint back and impact that uses the apple haiti and the haystack of

259
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,420
 only use that we generate while in afinsa

260
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,210
 we need sixth to get the mobile provision

261
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:40,330
 which and why according to the resources and criteria each

262
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:48,320
 and both allow us to install my peace on the device then we already have the

263
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,790
 break we already installed the application to do

264
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,710
 the jailbreak and we have and already then many times it happens to us or it has happened to me

265
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,799
 that using impact steals that they have made an error

266
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,539
 when I want to install and using and vice install is to install the application

267
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,580
 then one that I have insurance and I can also install it thanks to having a cell

268
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,360
 Derek then beyond having performed the above steps can

269
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,248
 fail the installation so we are going to see another way that can save us a

270
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:23,999
 consulting and what he told them before normally the client can give us a

271
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:30,000
 and by then if we are going to install we are going to use in this case the

272
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,820
 use the only one called a crack to an application l del 1 that is mobile

273
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,009
 security testing eyes of fungi we are going to decompress it will generate a

274
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:45,360
 folder that is called facebook later we are going to copy using in

275
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,199
 in this case ssp to the device we will go to the particular folder where it

276
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,639
 copy we are going to give execution permissions and then we are going to use a

277
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:04,139
 command called locates check to refresh the springbok which is the view

278
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:11,008
 main screen on the main screen of our device then we go to the

279
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:16,759
 site dogas download the ipade a crack of level 1

280
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,178
 We unzip it or we are going to unzip the hiccups in particular

281
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:26,799
 Look, it helps to generate a

282
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,830
 folder that says peillon and inside this folder will be all the

283
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,310
 resources of the application if I continue a little we see inside the

284
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:39,710
 folder and notice I still ls inside this folder was going to show all the

285
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:46,460
 application resources etc. then we already have to unzip the

286
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,690
 application what we are going to do now is copy it

287
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:56,000
 of our computer the device is that we copy it from the computer of the

288
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,820
 device we are going to compare copy in application bar

289
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,720
 and we are going to do the missing steps and here I am going to connect to the device

290
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,240
 using ssh via wifi later I will tell you how we can connect

291
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,500
 the device but notice develop in ssh I connect to the

292
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,770
 device and finished doing the missing steps ch mod

293
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,520
 I give execute permission to the only application that process to the

294
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,129
 main screen and I will have my application installed you understand this

295
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,330
 because I'm showing it to you because there are times we need to install

296
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,199
 applications fail us the normal mechanisms and we have to see how the

297
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,940
 we finished for and this is another way so if we give it

298
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,860
 We open the application, see that it is working there and we already have it installed

299
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,029
 the jailbroken app then summarized we saw three different ways to

300
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:56,129
 install apps well viable factor sainz generic idea with jailbreak

301
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:59,049
 so now to change the subject a little bit

302
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:03,510
 let's see the communication with the device

303
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,410
 we are going to install what the mobile device is and basically it allows us

304
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:13,790
 communicate with ios services using native protocols understand

305
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:19,740
 So I just showed them or did and stoner split

306
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,590
 install the application once you installed the library this particular

307
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:33,720
 I am who I know what it says and vice info and vice I do not know name of ID and vice

308
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,809
 then it helps us to begin to know a little more information or the

309
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,220
 communication with the device is understood then if it still denies and without

310
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,100
 we place after the reaction of if you look above it says version 12 4.6 be a

311
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,230
 A little further down says the times who is america argentina buenos aires

312
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,780
 a little below they say here from the wifi etc. then and vice install

313
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,220
 in particular we use it and notice what it says and vice versa - and I installed the

314
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,290
 app then

315
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:11,899
 how else are we going to communicate with the device using and tn the proxy

316
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:19,670
 bucks basically these two we are going to tunnel is a ssh tunnel to

317
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:24,110
 communicate with the device via usb is understood and here they tell me che and why

318
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,679
 they would do this and sometimes you need to analyze something

319
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,920
 in the device without internet connection it is understood then us

320
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:39,660
 It would serve us to make a tunnel over ssh via usb after others

321
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,400
 applications such as can be and explorer and famous that serve to have environments

322
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,530
 graphics and have to copy and information and the device to our a

323
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,870
 our computer and vice versa and it lost wifi

324
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:00,029
 then basically they have to download and tn the air

325
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:05,789
 the download link we will generate a cleaning shift

326
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:11,519
 usb and notice that it says built in fort esp connection on port 22 22 on a

327
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:17,789
 tab on our computer in a console we do ssh ssh road route

328
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:22,540
 localhost to the port and notice that we are going to have access to the

329
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,970
 device via ssh but since I put them to remember at the bottom what that means

330
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,589
 It is the default password that they put to enter via ssh

331
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,650
 once we have it is understood then once they have access they change the

332
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,909
 password and voila the same with the proxy is practically the same

333
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:49,529
 they configure it, wait for the connection and return to the same connection from their

334
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:55,279
 computer the device ssh room at localhost and the port

335
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,870
 and there we would have the connection via ssh then we got to what the

336
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:08,479
 slides from the beginning we are also going to download the applications a bit and have

337
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,400
 information from bbva then what does it mean

338
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,680
 adenex with one is that I will do nets how they go to windows and inside windows they go and

339
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,960
 device and simulator once they enter and another one will disappear

340
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,410
 window where notice that it says open console and if you click there you will

341
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,670
 opened the console today but first I want to make a note

342
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,620
 look down there it says installed applications and the

343
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:42,379
 ios application that is discussed if it is established that iván rodríguez is something that

344
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:50,770
 of eggs are all applications that serve to start and analyze that ios

345
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,820
 and to be able to understand the different scenarios etc. then with the

346
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,070
 I put them practical and notice that if I filter for something there I will have

347
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:06,310
 information in particular boyacá says I remember fail then

348
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:11,050
 we are going to go to a quite interesting topic which is the applications

349
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:18,250
 downloaded from the app store versus decrypted apps or what happens

350
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,550
 If we download an application from the app store and want to see, for example, the

351
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,659
 strings of the same

352
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,940
 then the apps downloaded from the app store are encrypted

353
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:38,139
 to be able to analyze them obviously we are going to need to decipher it, it can be done

354
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:43,310
 manual but we will not see it and continue with the jailbreak version

355
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,510
 We have no idea, I mean, we have it was 12 I remember

356
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:53,300
 we are going to use a tool and in particular by means of grooves the

357
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,290
 tool that we are going to use the writing in particular is called cold sampaio is

358
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:01,879
 which will allow us to script the application then

359
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,440
 previously we are going to need to install cold is one is a tool for

360
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,620
 dynamically instrument there is a lot of information on the internet

361
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,000
 having a lot in this has many functionalities but in particular we are

362
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,200
 Let's see how to invoke a script and have it run in the application that

363
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,310
 we are analyzing then to install cold it has to

364
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:31,350
 do pete install cold and cold your in cydia the first step this they do in

365
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,360
 your computer and this they will do on the device

366
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,919
 what does it mean enter Syria and add the repository the repository

367
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,410
 cold beagle point net and once they do that we look for cold in the

368
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,890
 device we install then we will not have install

369
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,430
 our computer and on the device once we do that we will

370
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:59,210
 download for example an application from the app store test light in particular

371
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,760
 because I explain why I told them when the talk started that a client

372
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,110
 You can give us the and for you can give us in the url of the app store or you can give us

373
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:16,179
 access to the esplai car by way through a code then we download

374
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,280
 d'esplai look at what I was telling you

375
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,350
 Let's see fill in the code and basically we'll have development access to the

376
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,459
 application they are developing is understood

377
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:36,430
 then if we use cold we are going to use in particular the medium cold ps

378
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:42,430
 and with an api where it will show us if in this image it shows us the

379
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:47,140
 processor and the name and identifier shows us the

380
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,470
 applications that are running that the first three have the process

381
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,550
 Haitian and the rest not, but in particular, look at the third that

382
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:59,860
 It says this is plate and we are going to stay with it, it identifies it with a point and

383
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,610
 point app store then

384
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:09,790
 we install cold and for white and already knowing the identifier what we are going to

385
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:15,879
 to do is we go cold and for him the identifac what does he mean we are going to

386
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,980
 pass with point 3 light and in particular note that it begins there and the

387
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:27,750
 second line says the third says say the scripting test light etc. and what

388
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:33,720
 means it gives us a ni for decryption that having been downloaded

389
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,860
 the play store then yes it recapitulated a little we already have an application of

390
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,539
 encryption the renown to re we name as test play the crypt him and then

391
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:49,439
 now we will copy the device with jailbreak the encrypted application to

392
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,329
 to be able to compare it is understood to be used cold a script to use cold and

393
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:00,629
 we have explayan scripts and now we are going to do the same with the given figure

394
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:04,529
 basically to be able to compare the next 9 a little bit of this then

395
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:09,850
 under there we have the command of frida and the

396
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:16,480
 picture and look down below the striped station is going to us

397
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,629
 show

398
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,359
 in this particular case I am using another script that what it does is show

399
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,770
 the ios information then brings us the folders well is the binary where

400
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,899
 there is the information that is the data field and so on then because today it is going to do

401
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:35,520
 this because we are going to copy the application from

402
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,870
 the app store to our computer and we need to generate the ipa smiling

403
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,790
 then the steps would be using the ccp we are going to copy the directory from

404
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:52,250
 band what it said is live.com then we create a folder but as

405
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,250
 we see the folder but the name of the application in art is

406
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,420
 light point we are going to move it to the folder requested compress a folder but

407
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,430
 of a set and then we are going to rename the sup in and for and we will be able to have

408
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,740
 the and stops to analyze them then

409
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:16,320
 If we do an ssp, notice this would be step number one, step number two is the

410
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,290
 hair day for the payload folder we move to the peillon folder we compress

411
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,600
 the file a style we compress we move from detesta and points and butterfly point and

412
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,799
 pa and well there we have step number 5 that

413
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,340
 it's starting to get a little faster now because I'm against it

414
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:42,490
 time and then we will compare the applications with hopper and with

415
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,520
 about 20 radars said Pérez and this is a disassembler pau that compiles

416
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,970
 and allows to back of applications allows to manipulate and revive the

417
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:59,020
 application and in this graphical environment it is understood then grab with hopper

418
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,610
 encrypted elipa, look at the carol caps and hopper inside

419
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:08,650
 video the strings and look at all this we can not read the information it is understood

420
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:14,050
 then what would be the next step the y to analyze with hopper and to

421
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:20,380
 decrypted then look at str and here to analyze the strings start to

422
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,730
 bring a little more information they understand each other

423
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,080
 then if we had entanglements or radars basically what we have to

424
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,400
 do is go cloud we install the application the same is a tool

425
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,480
 of free software to do reverse engineering among other things then

426
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,280
 we install r2 we are going to use some network commands

427
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,460
 what is analysis information and the information or information

428
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,810
 iceta and it is basically to search for strings in the section they did everything

429
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,910
 ordinary with I made list the classes methods and fields in the form that I want

430
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:03,240
 start form that is going to be to cycle right to memory ip pdf goes

431
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,649
 to be you undertake to serve union and finally it can be seen that it is a

432
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,730
 visual does not mean this we are going to start to analyze a little the

433
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:17,100
 application to see what information we can obtain once it is

434
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,880
 decrypt then let's load the encrypted ipa

435
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,450
 We are going to analyze it, we are going to press and the information and then we corroborate

436
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,950
 the crypto flag notice that down there all the way there

437
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,879
 there was the arrow

438
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,979
 says script or true place the application is encrypted and if we compare with the

439
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:42,939
 another application the script will say written boys so basically let's go

440
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:46,928
 to be able to start comparing and if we compare the strings of an application

441
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:53,679
 and the other, look at iceta of both and one says that it has 7,500 and the other 13,513 thousand

442
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:59,070
 seven hundred lines then what happens what is it that she was to understand that there is

443
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:05,990
 information that is encrypted and the other is not encrypted then then strikes

444
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:11,490
 we use and separate the methods or the classes notice what you say are inscribed

445
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,439
 dating the same

446
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,480
 in hitler form they are encrypted so if we compare the decryption they go

447
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,640
 Let's see what the information begins says nine months string young and so on

448
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,750
 we are going to start having strings and that is the first thing that would do what they are

449
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:36,240
 It happens that you can use it to search from http to to find the url of

450
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,020
 connection to an ip address or whatever you can start to analyze a

451
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,430
 little app and app stars

452
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:50,609
 So if we use I did look at it says I put zero and we can't even start to see the

453
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:56,180
 code itself of the application then this is very useful

454
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,618
 remember that I showed you an image of text flight that you would laugh I can

455
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:05,240
 make and segre building and search in particular the s button

456
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,629
 If something tells me what the memory address means, I'll get ready

457
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,590
 in particular in the after button and to be able to make a plan of six in

458
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:18,230
 dysfunction and see function etc. and see visual mode as well but not

459
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,800
 I want to go into a lot of detail so basically we will be able to analyze the

460
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,480
 application that else we could do the analysis of internal information

461
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,360
 then we would look for felix file in that I am default what is sql like

462
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,869
 korda test hours etc. so I want to control the time

463
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:43,029
 perfect those would be some of the questions we would look for you don't love me

464
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:48,490
 extend a lot because we also have 45 minutes but basically we would start

465
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:54,459
 look for the internal information generated by our application then they remember

466
00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:01,529
 this particular image when I used a breeding script called ios info

467
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:08,380
 brought us the information and if you look in particular there in the data is

468
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,060
 the first application bar containers and he

469
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,540
 there is the information of the application so what are we going to do let's

470
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,650
 access there and copy it for example to our device to our

471
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:27,730
 computer then the options are enter with ssh to the directory this that

472
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,390
 I mentioned them perfect ssh enter the directory

473
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:37,870
 Notice that there I make a ls under the whole and a plate appears as notes

474
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:43,060
 metri config point movies I do not know if it has information or not but in particular what

475
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,420
 What I want to show you is that in this way we could begin to analyze the

476
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,670
 internal information of the application is understood help you have to start looking

477
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:57,250
 that is going to be all used if he uses etcetera then

478
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,780
 or we access the device as we just did and see the information or copy

479
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,520
 all using ssp although it is back in command

480
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,040
 and all the information generated by the application is copied to the device of the

481
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,759
 device to our computer and there they analyze it from your computer

482
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,470
 understand already almost to finish the last

483
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:26,339
 a little bit because I thought I was running out of time

484
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:32,060
 let's see it in the classic configuration next then

485
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,160
 basically we are going to do a man in the middle this particular image is

486
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,080
 the man in the middle proxy if you are to the next winner's sailor site

487
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,910
 write image which is the configuration of a regular next but which is

488
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,220
 important to understand is that we are going to

489
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,910
 and install an application on the device and we will want to see the

490
00:41:54,910 --> 00:42:01,490
 traffic of that particular application on our device is understood

491
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,379
 then what we are going to do is unanimous leader adding even so one be in this

492
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,990
 case is going to be work now I am going to show you and in particular why because

493
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:16,240
 it will allow us to see the traffic

494
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:22,509
 encryption of the application is understood then

495
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:27,780
 we download wall go to ur official site

496
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:36,770
 look, download the latest version and what are you going to do?

497
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,230
 your computer's ip address and then that's step number one then

498
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:47,500
 What are they going to do? They are going to go to options within a pandin editor

499
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:55,220
 specifiers a and notice l there in edit then they are going to put by two port and

500
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,410
 they will put for example the port 80 80 and the specific address of my

501
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:06,129
 computer then once I do this I'm going to go to

502
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:10,380
 device and inside the device I will go to the

503
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,989
 part of wifi 6 wifi and entrusted the proxy

504
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:20,489
 basically what am i going to do i am going to put where server says my ip address and

505
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:26,350
 where that port the port that you configure the hamburg with

506
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:32,200
 again I am going to enter http two points bar bar bourg note one is that

507
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,490
 do that it will look vintage this image is very small maybe but yes

508
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,180
 you do the test on your devices on your computer because

509
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,098
 they can give the same disappears in one and says be certified

510
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:50,079
 and what does it mean if we click on it, it will tell us that this site is trying

511
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:57,980
 to download in a configuration of a particular profile if we allow it

512
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,220
 and we go to the side we download the profile

513
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:07,149
 you have to do that we go to the device and we see that

514
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,740
 particles says by twitter it is not verified that it means that

515
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,200
 This certificate is that we are wanting to install it is not within the

516
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,720
 device or it is outside what is iphone or ios then

517
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,100
 we are wanting to put a certificate on the device and we will be able to

518
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,880
 do because we have the break and we are going to validate this form, it is understood if not

519
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,160
 no we could not do this we could only see http traffic and https se

520
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:44,109
 understand then we give it install once we install it notice that of the

521
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:50,280
 Image 9 to 11 went from not seeing and fayad verified and we already have configured

522
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,340
 then exposed this example site with oas dot org enter there and once

523
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,790
 who enter there will be able to see the traffic and song to the left that

524
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:07,060
 says host and says https of points slash slash and and so on with its applications or

525
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,600
 The application they need analyzed was opened to me to start seeing the

526
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:18,038
 traffic of the application then almost to finish it takes two

527
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,350
 slice to what are the references a bit

528
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:28,470
 or incidentally making a chapter a little are the first of what it is and not always

529
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,770
 that in particular after the tools we use would be and

530
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,910
 apple saints to install applications what is la vila and what too

531
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:41,339
 we use in cydia gum impact not to use impact

532
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:50,070
 hopper r2 and lastly hard also this would be at least e

533
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,420
 indispensable for analyzing behavioral applications

534
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:00,240
 Last but not least, do not forget to analyze your applications

535
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,180
 periodically

536
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:10,379
 and that's all thank you very much and mediators juana very good truth

537
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,569
 that as always impeccable and super clear well if you think we have a couple of

538
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:20,620
 questions that were thrown in the chat if you think I have watching

539
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:25,720
 the two are related so if you think I read them together because

540
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,560
 They asked if the computer tumbaco that could be a hacking 2 and the second

541
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,570
 The question that is related to this is if you said like this if at one time

542
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:40,090
 I know myself that you could not have all this functionality perfect good and

543
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,430
 the macintosh, the truth is that I don't know, no

544
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:49,770
 you just have to try it but yes

545
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:56,430
 basically elective would be to use the mark because this restriction in

546
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,259
 particular and had to see as next com I do not know if excon can be executed in

547
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:05,849
 more attentive in such a case I think that if you could but honestly that question is

548
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:10,769
 I do not know and the other perfect ok but we kept a small interference

549
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:19,450
 this was working use it from in 9m the mistress has a bm

550
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,319
 sincerely

551
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:27,960
 our fingers sure that it could and is more I risk saying no for

552
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,410
 a question of architectures and [Music]

553
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:37,740
 if you definitely do not want to give as a 100% confirmation if the one who has the

554
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:42,569
 water in particular after the wii not milk to see what the zinc was

555
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:47,910
 hackintosh and virtualized ok perfect here you have the whole question it says

556
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:53,029
 impact would work on an iphone that is locked from icloud

557
00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:00,319
 impact would work on an iphone that is locked from icloud in particular

558
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,910
 if it is locked with icloud

559
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,470
 when you can access the device or be part

560
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:15,750
 I would have to try it sincerely no I have not tried that I understand what

561
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:24,260
 I am thinking one has the iphone starts and it will be do not do it rice

562
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,810
 clear except that previously that rooted state and has not had the tur

563
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,009
 installed and after blocking or it should be seen but it is not a scenario

564
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:40,190
 half particular soles and half strange and the particular I the discount that is in

565
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:45,260
 The devices that I have used that normally used are depends on the

566
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:50,420
 versions are are devices that were working and that one ends

567
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,740
 performing the jailbreak or the device is working in this case

568
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:59,240
 in particular we should see it here here you have another little question says that

569
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,390
 Recommended tool for static disaster analysis

570
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:11,118
 how brave I recommend there are some tools

571
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:18,190
 This is also a bit complicated, I don't know if complicated, but

572
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,430
 we enter the point of view payment 1 payment for example

573
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:32,590
 I am not sorry that it works well efe

574
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:38,520
 continue to dispute some information is brought after it is

575
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,590
 d but

576
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:50,930
 well the names of the applications are not coming at this time

577
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:56,180
 in particular but all help that is also helps that in particular this

578
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:00,100
 What would it be if the application is encrypted, we will not be able to see anything

579
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,720
 we should do it in the previous step that is, although with the routes you need

580
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:11,450
 be exact later well here you have another question if it is possible to get to the code

581
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:19,129
 of an application for ios if you can I showed it briefly when

582
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:25,610
 I used I did and cc with r2 basically there what it shows you are the methods

583
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:30,110
 the classes and so on and we can see the application code there are other ways

584
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:35,480
 also to do it if another is using cold cold basically

585
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,860
 what we can do is load a writing where depending on whether it is of

586
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:45,440
 sex or sexy or sweet we will be able to see the methods, classes etc. in

587
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,010
 particular of the application that we are analyzing and this is in time of

588
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:53,019
 execution with which if you can access the code

589
00:50:53,019 --> 00:51:00,968
 It has to be we decipher the skin what is it you wonder what opinion

590
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:08,579
 do you have about the yum what opinion do you have about him I don't know

591
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:16,109
 that is, I used it last year and training in particular and it works well

592
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:22,990
 not good in the sense of what virtualization ends up being with

593
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:30,129
 distance where a device that virtualized rm and worked well that is

594
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,210
 It seems to me that it is good, it would be good that there is

595
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:39,010
 things more corelli and that are also cheaper to be able to use it

596
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,940
 but but it is not good and depends on the

597
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:48,609
 resources assigned in particular to the application works better

598
00:51:48,609 --> 00:52:00,460
 It is understood if the fingers or whatever but I have the most economical perfect

599
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,150
 and later they consult you with this I think I had answered it a little before but

600
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,150
 yes with a locked iphone from icloud tools functions

601
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,920
 used in the talk well we already mentioned it

602
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,140
 then well yes to make a verín de medel if the application has specials

603
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:22,259
 sacrifice spinning if paraguay walk as in android of course good perfect that

604
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:27,720
 It is a scenario, its noble protection is not nothing, the only one I spoke about was the

605
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:34,859
 tools or the basic being one needs to start analyzing ios

606
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,370
 Y

607
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,618
 I repeated the question, you tell me that is the spinning be happy

608
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:50,350
 yes bone there are different tools for example

609
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:58,039
 and well I remember the name now I can also add them calmly

610
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:02,500
 after the steps there are different tools that help

611
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,620
 for example for me in my particular case what I usually use is cold

612
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:13,799
 there is universal let's the spinning bypass that is the spinning for version 11 the

613
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,970
 12 now there is one there for 13 as well and

614
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:23,959
 there are different different tools the little sister that

615
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,640
 I want to tell you, I believe it

616
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:32,549
 and the company is there and I do not get the name of the application but hey

617
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:37,529
 basically what i ended up doing they put frida gadget and used a ago

618
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:43,369
 year that's the spinning bypass by means of cold

619
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:47,240
 but in particular I would recommend using cold

620
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:53,839
 look for them ssl we are going to go to that is the spinning they give and download it

621
00:53:53,839 --> 00:54:00,120
 use cold load in script with medium l use writing

622
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:09,000
 and they will be able to do perfect spinning bypass and finally it's good and this

623
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,570
 also good we mentioned it a little before but deep questions are a

624
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,750
 little about a previous question if access to the code is limited or is accessed

625
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,170
 to the whole

626
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:24,779
 and that it would be limited or so or not access to the entire code or

627
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:31,119
 basically if you talk about comparison I will compare a little with android

628
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,319
 motion is good but basically we have an application

629
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:41,500
 we make the decree and access the code and

630
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,660
 for example in android we go if the application is obfuscated we compile

631
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:51,480
 the application and we agree to do the whole process of applying

632
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,520
 from apec to mali

633
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,299
 there is a little step in between which is c's

634
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,750
 to get to what is the point java for example the application can be

635
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:09,570
 obfuscated and we will see from the integer names of the functions or classes

636
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:14,910
 We are going to see a permutation that you can call, for example, but in general

637
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:20,310
 if we agree to good use we are already on schedule so now it has had to be

638
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:24,540
 very many ratios of the invaluable presentation and good and the rest for

639
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:30,090
 Please do not disconnect because now comes the next next talk like this

640
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,100
 good in a second we are back

641
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,810
 thanks a lot to the game thanks to stays
