00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,710
 córdoba hacker space if it seems to you for the people it has it

25
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,369
 Hello, good morning, how are you doing, Roberto?

26
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,440
 Muñoz tells you about the truth that it is a pleasure to start these activities

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,900
 I came with waiting in Cordoba so well in my case I am director of the

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,400
 ute information systems engineering degree at regional faculty

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,910
 Córdoba and also a teacher in the races so we are at the disposal of the event

30
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,079
 and he is accompanying me at this moment in engineer fabián pennini

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,110
 Hi, how are you? The truth is that welcome everyone and thank you very much for

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,590
 be and for having had the possibility that we can be present in this

33
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,550
 event that for us is very important and good in my case I am

34
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,610
 responsible for the systems degree laboratory in which

35
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,930
 we increased a lot for the info sector community

36
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,450
 good good very good I gave this panel to all the people who

37
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,420
 are listening at the moment it would be a bit to comment what is the link with

38
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,649
 the organizing team or at least this edition of specifically with the

39
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,939
 safe informed tica since I shared it for those who do not know it although still

40
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,719
 they had some doubt out there what it is about well today we are a

41
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,829
 company that is dedicated to making events related to computer security

42
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,120
 to see a question particularly for the guys from 'hackers' page as they think

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,660
 that you joined that if in the computer security for a little more from

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,710
 for several years as you think I know that computer insurance was incorporated into the

45
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:46,610
 province of cordoba just a couple of years ago now 15 years had

46
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:53,430
 a community of hacks that belonged to the boys of Córdoba street

47
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,870
 we actively had a couple of months doing some talks take the girls

48
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,650
 in a bar with a sponsor and for one question or another

49
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:13,189
 it was stopped making and good last year along with frames that they presented to us

50
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:17,510
 Being what korda we were introduced to in las vegas at defcon

51
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,089
 We said something we have to have in Cordoba

52
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,888
 so luckily we made the first visa in cordoba back to break a

53
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,060
 second tell me how it was that they met there in two Cordobeses the smoke

54
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,650
 in a niche that is computer security in las vegas if the ships were going to talk

55
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:45,888
 in black hat in the arsenal and well they introduced us in the in the

56
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:53,389
 party at the white welcome party

57
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,370
 It was seen and we made visits at night with the symbol at the closing of the visa and

58
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,430
 well it was joaquín let's also say we have to have something else

59
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:17,350
 more more often and more guys then get a chance to be a hacker

60
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,190
 space in good settings at the time I was working at a company that mcafee and

61
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,050
 raised the need and well mcafee gave us the opportunity to have a space

62
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,289
 physical and good from October and October

63
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:42,419
 we started the opening and there we already started with the events when with obviously in

64
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,020
 all social networks

65
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,910
 be active and good today we are in online mode and we already have a good

66
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,350
 public that follows us and every 15 days we are trying to do events and

67
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,419
 listen to me in what year was the first contact covers and córdoba de por

68
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,960
 less from your observable universe no cordoba safe computing is those

69
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,479
 talks that take place wherever you want

70
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:21,539
 2002 and 2000 and 2001 and 2011 more or less 2013

71
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:28,389
 enough but we were few and what yes there were many many boys of the favor of

72
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:35,130
 the Córdoba Mathematics Faculty and well they give a lot of talks too

73
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,980
 that today they are also members of the

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,750
 and in games you did not always live there we did not go for a short time for

75
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,940
 labor agreements I worked as a tractor with one of the companies that

76
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,500
 They used to work in Buenos Aires so I had the opportunity to meet you there

77
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,120
 but what was the reason of your life to leave and let alone in that company

78
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,370
 what mission has been working but well nothing I was a personal decision for

79
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,150
 a matter of living a little more calmly and escaping a little with doing is

80
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,610
 many of us know there and play in those relationships will continue in

81
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,460
 n share and of course that is what fosters that space

82
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,479
 our days we see each other in Las Vegas and I live here

83
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:44,990
 3 km and I do not see it I am quite new so I stopped answering this

84
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,900
 ask because I'm pretty new to what the security community is here from

85
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,099
 Cordoba before what I mentioned chicho is something

86
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,490
 that caught my attention because when they organized the visa

87
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,490
 and I said obviously I'm going to go because I want to know the community like that

88
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,030
 security here and I was struck a lot but a lot by the amount

89
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,859
 of people and I told them I mentioned that to make a first event that

90
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,280
 on top of that well they were lucky that let's say that well no luck if not

91
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,950
 They made it perfect and it came out great in the after with this one there taking some

92
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,219
 beers with them I told them it seems to me that you have to exploit that this community

93
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,060
 continues to develop because there are many many people and there is a lot of interest that is

94
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,650
 weird to see that so I'm like this just got here trying to do things

95
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,880
 I also suggested that we do a 'jam session' or something and well that later

96
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,500
 He ended up riding on this which is left wanting face but I from my side and from

97
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,690
 my humble vision of someone who has just arrived I believe that Cordoba has a

98
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,590
 gigantic potential to man refers to security and people with very

99
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,440
 trained and also people with a lot of desire to learn so it is good that

100
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,030
 successive developing ok and it was introducing with more in perspective

101
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,260
 that you have said, I was talking about the gift of 2011, more or less you of the

102
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,920
 university side leave in what time more or less were you seeing it in what

103
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:09,110
 way was introduced and give the error actually in the formal

104
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:16,640
 what is our current curriculum is 2008 and security

105
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,790
 is transversal in different curricula in different spaces that we have in the

106
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,939
 subjects this is a plan although it is from ute ny shared with voices

107
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,980
 regional more currently in what is happening in the universities is

108
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,960
 say in our curricula in different ways we have implemented

109
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,350
 security and even outside the curriculum are also implemented what

110
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:51,440
 are elective subjects with the central security theme that is not looking at

111
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,450
 future, that is, currently the universities and through what the

112
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,550
 nation's education ministry approved as reserved activities

113
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,109
 for degrees like ours in bachelor's degree engineering that

114
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:13,200
 they are in what is computer science systems we already have specifically

115
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,990
 a reserved activity in which in the next study plans of all

116
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,959
 the country's universities are going to have to reflect content activities and

117
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,160
 compliance with what is security within the study plan that is to say and

118
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,930
 Now formally it is a requirement since it is effectively reserved for the

119
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,459
 universities, the issue of security carries much more weight than it could

120
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,529
 have in previous years in other large studios

121
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,689
 and with regard to the races here there is a user who asks if they do not have a

122
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,569
 plan from the ute side to implement a career specifically

123
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:53,889
 security or if it has not happened in the past

124
00:10:53,889 --> 00:11:00,970
 In reality, what has been done in the formalization of education rather than

125
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,249
 everything is done in specializations and masters is currently oriented

126
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,959
 mainly to what is the degrees the generation of a curriculum of a

127
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,358
 new career, the truth is that it takes a long time to reach different

128
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:20,980
 spaces that have to be approved and given us

129
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,859
 the place and the budgets for which this also currently limits

130
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:29,589
 we are mainly in specialization and master's degrees in many

131
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,699
 universities in the country the issue of security

132
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,059
 does not add

133
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,630
 is what I propose is since ute n for several years we come

134
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,630
 commenting from the laboratory the possibility of uses precisely in the

135
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,920
 mainly free open technologies

136
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,829
 and we gradually got into the security aspects

137
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,170
 I believe that little by little we have also been promoting the community internally

138
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,719
 let's say when it comes to safety and well

139
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,850
 I think I saw Saiz was the one who united us together with Marcos and Chicho and Joaquín and

140
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,920
 well we were able to move forward together and good also to have the possibility today

141
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,870
 to be in this event that for us is very important and

142
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,480
 mainly for the infosec community here in Córdoba and this fruit from

143
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,180
 left it open I do not know the background of the boys related to the

144
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,540
 academic aspects but they can still give their opinion from outside as they believe

145
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,949
 both from outside the university and within the institutions that

146
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:55,020
 computer security was cleaning or was modifying influencing the

147
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,000
 races races because within the context of what is shared and everything

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,720
 that at least we try to do within the objectives and visions that

149
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,180
 we have as a company what we do is promote what is the

150
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,680
 shift left not like inside let's give an example the development cycle

151
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,550
 try to explain to people that computer science is not

152
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,810
 something that is added later is a security file that should be worked on

153
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,609
 from the beginning not before that's why the chipset is like that inside all

154
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,530
 the processes further be no matter what kind of methodologies you use to try to

155
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,660
 moving it more to the left no more towards the beginning as they think that yes

156
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,610
 if it was done that way if it was progressive or how it has been since

157
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,630
 their perception that this was being introduced to the academic environment

158
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,760
 university student only to me what I think happens to many of us

159
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,470
 is that we are in the communities that all the time are wondering how

160
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,590
 did you do to learn where did you learn then

161
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:07,870
 that's that great question that has existed for a couple of years, I think I also vote

162
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,820
 to what is the university environment then where they realize I think

163
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,440
 that there where they realized that if there is here there is something else that is one I will

164
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,939
 put more than a schedule has that there are other activities then

165
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:28,519
 from what I see in the universities

166
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,738
 are aware that people are interested in safety and I think

167
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:38,199
 that's why they are putting the batteries at this time for a couple of years too

168
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,920
 I personally knew what an insecurity diploma is here in Córdoba

169
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,900
 which was for me something very strange and obviously it was experimental and today in

170
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,630
 day is already a solid diploma

171
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,270
 we had not followed the line of what the boy says

172
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,740
 and prepare it for the people you get that I think are the eminences in this

173
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,220
 issue to me on a personal level it seems to me that as

174
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,850
 we say more

175
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,410
 and the fact that security is something that is so dynamic and goes

176
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,980
 changing with so much speed and that it is true that it is very difficult to

177
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,950
 Sometimes a university curriculum will follow the fact of the appearance

178
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:26,350
 security specializations and that those specializations capable and

179
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,850
 have a much more dynamic curriculum update regularity than

180
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,750
 a career that does not have a process to be approved it seems to me that

181
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,410
 are let's say you are allowing the development of security at the

182
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,760
 academic is much more advanced but it is also good that there is also a

183
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,839
 bunch of non-formal channels to follow too

184
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,839
 learning and training and certifications but I do believe that for

185
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,720
 at least in recent years it is a very dynamic environment and it is coming

186
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,010
 changing and comes trying to conform and again to reach the race with

187
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,120
 what is good security development

188
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:12,310
 yes yes in they pose a little to what I am going down here totally agree on at the level

189
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,439
 University, as Roberto said two times, the plans have been changing because it is

190
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,300
 totally dynamic in the aspect in which all of us are incorporated

191
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:30,279
 and I think that somehow it is being understood not only what the

192
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,160
 need and I always said that in each unit of one of each subject one

193
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,110
 have the security unit but start incorporating it as boxing

194
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,600
 raised throughout the cycle is precisely that need to understand that

195
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,529
 We cannot wait for this product to be ready but we have to start from

196
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,870
 much earlier which from the academic point of view that they are modifying

197
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,390
 We are now incorporating them and that will bring about better

198
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:07,089
 results as well as from the internal groups of the laboratory

199
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,379
 collaborates with the subjects precisely to help in aspects that out there

200
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,439
 they cannot achieve it because they do not have the expertise and we collaborate so that

201
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,800
 students have the necessary level for the job opportunity and I join the

202
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,389
 that joaquín raises that it is not only the university but also

203
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:34,270
 suggest that in parallel I believe that having so much dynamism the fact of being

204
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,760
 here in listening to security contributions it is important for them

205
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,910
 also see the way and taking and good and just new knowledge about

206
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,440
 about what they like to learn and others, that is, it is not only formality

207
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,050
 university but also being self-taught

208
00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:00,620
 and take, let's say, of the different courses that are even free, all that adds up

209
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,409
 I believe that this community I fully join a precisely a

210
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,220
 list that you have enjoy a text that you have to be armed that is very

211
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,030
 well and that I find very interesting to share to feel that you are

212
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,220
 just starting up and well there I am going to what to throw in that link in the group in

213
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:26,210
 the chat of tweets and now I'm going to ask a question from roberto de las

214
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,420
 several people who are talking to cadel evans as they want to know some

215
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,710
 little things is the link that the user just passed

216
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,870
 share and in tweets is basically came from a student panel that put together

217
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,889
 I echo it about three years ago

218
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:48,320
 that ends up solving, so to speak, the problem or all the questions that

219
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,428
 they did us in university settings that when I gave talks several

220
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:56,990
 years and I got together with people that I admire a lot who have also been

221
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,480
 doing the same so what we did was basically

222
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,210
 there is quite subjective but it has gone from empirically in the experience of

223
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,169
 people who are involved and people from the environment answered questions that

224
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:15,390
 We saw that they were repeated so if they enter that link they will be able to see a lot of

225
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,990
 You ask how does the word hacker mean that

226
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,780
 is to be a hacker who does not work out different mechanisms studies

227
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,610
 it is convenient for them to do a career it is not convenient to have a career it is appropriate

228
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,870
 being certifications does not agree with other certifications and within everything it has

229
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,850
 as a motivational medium tint that is not really necessary as that

230
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,139
 Motivation also arises when you read that not necessarily peacefully for the

231
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,200
 career in computer science in terms of employment but also motivates women

232
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,950
 people to take responsibility for their own and that if there is something that serves you

233
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,200
 go that way for example if in my case having the university helped me

234
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,710
 like structure but being self-taught and a lot of decision things

235
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,429
 computer science that they go to the university name I did not foresee then the

236
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,960
 I had to look elsewhere because here in Tandil it is not computer safe

237
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,830
 then it's good not to get stuck as if to say new but to the

238
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,490
 university is not giving me this and well if there are a lot of things the

239
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,750
 University of the structure that teaches you to work with people who by and

240
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,289
 not in the legio climbs that are a work environment a lot happens to you

241
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,070
 teaches you to have a deadline teaches you to organize yourself teaches you to document yourself

242
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,750
 teaches a lot of values ​​that unless you get them by force

243
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,039
 working with the possibility of having a work complication

244
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,330
 everything is given in a quite interesting and safe environment but if there is

245
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,389
 issues that they feel they have to solve and the university not only

246
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,380
 plan to look elsewhere you do not have to stay jobs or you work like no

247
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,029
 but this, what happened to me at one point, you can see it here

248
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:00,039
 Roberto I have the questions here that there are a lot of interested people

249
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:06,610
 we have 500 beavers at the moment and the truth continues to rise that we are very

250
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,360
 happy and happy that they are adding us so if they continue doing

251
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,169
 questions I'm going to be passing on to the boys here

252
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:20,910
 and they asked how the programs are evolving or

253
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,300
 subjects that try to incorporate safe informed ethics

254
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,760
 that's one and let's start with this one and if you believe tdt you

255
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,360
 I will do the following after seeing the beginning although our spaces

256
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,240
 curricula have certain structures, the truth is that it was very

257
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,750
 intelligent the curricular design and the ministerial resolution that gave us

258
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,610
 Javier in 2008 our current study plan because within those

259
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,979
 spaces there is a series of minimal contents but ultimately with the

260
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,630
 chairs with teachers with coordinators and with whom we come

261
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,420
 living in the middle we have had the possibility of adapting, that is to say that

262
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,950
 within the subjects to say operating systems

263
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,809
 upper management that works with databases of information networks

264
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,500
 communications in each of these subjects including what is

265
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,289
 programming, the security issue begins without the need for a

266
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:33,840
 formal question as a minimum content what I mentioned a while ago is that

267
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,330
 already through resolution and editorial if formalized is the need and the

268
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,980
 obligation of our careers to incorporate computer security

269
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,230
 with a space of its own this that Fabián receives us in our previous plan

270
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,840
 Security is transversal, that is, it appears in different units of

271
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,529
 different subjects currently the requirement is already one

272
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:06,570
 own existence of security and this we have been talking about in different

273
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:12,178
 academic spaces of which we are taking part

274
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,340
 the engineering network in computer bar systems that we have at the

275
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:23,730
 national with more than 35 opportunities that we work careers of systems and

276
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,950
 computer science that studies the vehicles arguing and when she did not leave the

277
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,799
 draft of the minister of education and the simple interuniversity council the

278
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,110
 concept of incorporating security in fact that we saw as logical

279
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:47,248
 load is logical in our environment and in particular in corda the participation of

280
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:53,519
 companies in the middle since the arrival of multinationals or the

281
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,659
 creation of what is the short technological plan for more than two hundred

282
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:05,129
 companies are as partners as members of that cluster make Cordoba a

283
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:09,090
 space in which the development of informatics the development of

284
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,250
 computing is normal and within that what is

285
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,039
 safety as essential and in fact that the thought that we did last year

286
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,640
 with the hacker guys you are in the faculty showed the interest of the

287
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,269
 students but also people who are working in the middle for

288
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:34,549
 participate and in fact that the registration you have had to share in this

289
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:41,090
 presentation without being in person without being buenos aires and personally in the

290
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,689
 grateful to think inside because that is more important and in

291
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,970
 definitively it was going to be in face-to-face mode and we hope not

292
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,809
 Let's forget about this for a next year of radio cinema shows a very avid medium

293
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:05,210
 safety and to discuss these issues and to share the experiences and

294
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,299
 listen to all the people who can provide advice and knowledge

295
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:17,250
 I have a reflection talking a little about what you said why

296
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,549
 reminding me a bit in the past I was also in the position and in the

297
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:26,559
 situation of finding myself saying it was a computer security career

298
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,049
 I want a career in computer science but then I say if I do

299
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,168
 awareness and I say that computer security would have to come as a basis

300
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:37,779
 in all the underlying concepts being taught then it would be wrong and

301
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:40,450
 there was a career in computing because you, as comfortable people, also

302
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,659
 you say the computer series in the race you see all the subjects in a

303
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:48,380
 transversal then a difference would have to be made as

304
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,420
 computer action is like saying be something that today is like

305
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,930
 say i want a computer degree how to say i want a

306
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,170
 programming career today because if we are talking about

307
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,130
 engineering and computer science development software is obviously

308
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,400
 programming will be included and good for us having perspectives on

309
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,300
 computing is today security has to be included then in the case

310
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,800
 of what is a career more oriented to software development would have to

311
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,700
 These come included from the base secure programming policies and in

312
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,940
 any case make a career apart no this i'm not thinking too much but

313
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,270
 but to make the differentiation a bit not a race part that

314
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,129
 be more holistic in terms of non-target-oriented training security

315
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,550
 software development but aimed at having a basic concept of programming

316
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,760
 and an understanding of the operating system architectures

317
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,140
 design and computer security in general to be able to audit I do not know

318
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,670
 what would you call it but that differentiation seems good to you, why if you ask us

319
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,780
 a computer science election war and after that is to finish elaborating in the

320
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,200
 software development if you don't have to do science age no

321
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,999
 you have to do careers by specialization is normal is that the

322
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:06,950
 format of our careers ultimately generate training and

323
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,580
 sufficient basis so that the students in the course of the

324
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,639
 five years begin to visualize the profile that interests them by looking at the whole

325
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:20,779
 panorama that we have and all that software life cycle that we are proposing

326
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:27,139
 you just killed then later you are going to dedicate let's say when one returns

327
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:32,869
 of the faculty says oh and now and now is when you have to put yourself to see in

328
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:38,240
 what and specialize because let's say if you like the topic of hitting positives from

329
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,840
 security issue if you like the issue of networks we have a panorama

330
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,959
 too broad of what computing system computing and indeed in the

331
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,690
 current environment we all live together and those who did not have a career coexist

332
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,769
 college who did a course who did a degree who did a

333
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:02,480
 specialization and who did a doctorate and all are in companies

334
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,429
 obviously working with different profiles and possibilities out there in

335
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:12,529
 some cases but all are living together in this environment is the reality

336
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,279
 It is one more question that has occurred to me because Fabián can answer it to me

337
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,379
 ask about the ute laboratory is only for students or can

338
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:25,340
 participate in any way a person other than a regular student by

339
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,799
 example in the case of the systems laboratory

340
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:36,429
 we usually concentrate groups that are usually students of the career

341
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:42,309
 systems but we have open a game that is through certain

342
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,519
 tools such as people who normally do not attend college

343
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,639
 tools through some virtual means to be able to have

344
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:56,620
 communication in which we also have challenges so that they can go

345
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,219
 joining the proposal is precisely making a more open game

346
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,080
 normally we have always worked with internal students of the faculty

347
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,720
 we have been working like this because they are the ones who approach again obviously not

348
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,019
 It is not outside staff usually the guys who are not from ute n

349
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,879
 They look around in others in other sectors and well we did not find out but

350
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:26,110
 the idea is to open up the community a bit but we also have the community of

351
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,419
 hacker space which seems to me to be a totally valid space in this

352
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,980
 we also participate as hiding we try to be also present in

353
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:42,370
 the events of them and I think we see a physical place is not necessary

354
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:49,158
 but it is for the community info I know that in Cordoba

355
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,869
 you get either the cordoba hacker space or I think we are all

356
00:29:54,869 --> 00:30:03,509
 the same and well we go that way but this does not respond to responds game

357
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:07,439
 and now I ask a question to all of you related to this ok

358
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,879
 precisely the foot and good that it gave me and fabián shock and to mention that that they know

359
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:15,418
 that if they are also looking for some kind of laboratory and tests that I eat well

360
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,319
 said they had this one not only drops space we are an open community and

361
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,069
 It has no cost to be part of it you can join we do ctf if we do a

362
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:27,658
 a lot of activities that we go just that what a place of

363
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,450
 apprentice learning forgiveness and relaxation

364
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,540
 and the idea is that they also build a community with different knowledge

365
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,780
 different different parts of the training security that quite broad

366
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,649
 is nothing and you are looking for some references that can help

367
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:49,280
 teach these practices to those who are interested in learning the

368
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,250
 look just with if I don't know if you want to say something roll if you just add a

369
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:00,710
 detail everything that is an event that has been published since our career since

370
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,540
 our faculty are open to the public that is to say one thing is to enter a

371
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,770
 laboratory where the chairs normally make use of the laboratories

372
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,629
 but any event should rehearse the talk we do with the companies of the

373
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:19,910
 even because companies also offer us the possibility of

374
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,260
 buy with their specialists that is always open to the public

375
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,520
 then it seems to me that it is also another way of adding and in fact that

376
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,629
 acquaintance arose with the boys from caracas well adjusted the question that

377
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,270
 I wanted to do it was a little to all and related to this but more specific

378
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,830
 How do people get in touch? They are from Cordoba, imagine

379
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,139
 No people from Cordoba or people outside at this time too, but how do you do?

380
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,470
 someone who wants to enter the world of computer action to

381
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,700
 get in touch in Cordoba with someone for what

382
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,330
 will accompany its beginnings is a somewhat abstract question I just asked

383
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,689
 repairing a little all the questions that people have been asking like I am

384
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,240
 student and now that the laboratories are not closed enough to

385
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,019
 to introduce myself in the information technology where where do I go if I am in

386
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:16,039
 Córdoba and I want to get together, so if you want you can try a little of all the

387
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,100
 information and resources available to them the same as roberto said

388
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,090
 of these events that they organize that are open to the public as they do if

389
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:30,080
 They want to see space just as I was saying it is different, juaco not only

390
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,899
 we are very active on social media on twitter sda

391
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:42,370
 hacker space and the pointer is cordoba hacker space and

392
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:48,459
 we have the site that is cordoba oscar space point by axis and well now

393
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,550
 We also have the YouTube channel where we are uploading all the

394
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:56,840
 activities that are virtual and there you can contact we are

395
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,110
 always available to answer questions and is obviously super open

396
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,669
 to any query and slack just the part of the most part of

397
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,010
 community that we have on twitter we have to incriminate a slack where

398
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,129
 we have a lot of channels where all the security issues are

399
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,050
 computing and all these things that we are all interested in are discussed are done

400
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,379
 consultation we help each other also sometimes someone is left with a

401
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,040
 problem and among the whole community we try to help him so it's good

402
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,320
 yes they want to join a community

403
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,720
 that's a good start I value from the womb

404
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,090
 well actually at the ute level the cordoba regional faculty is our

405
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:51,580
 general page of all the depth that is www frc 12 point educ.ar there

406
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:58,600
 all the careers are all that are training in what would be done from

407
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,199
 Diplomas courses talks are demonstrated there and within what they are

408
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,270
 departments and careers this engineering in systems that when the event out there

409
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:14,320
 It is smaller and does not allow to be published on the faculty page because

410
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,449
 really there all elements of the faculty come together we do it from the

411
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:25,418
 department and it is also published so on that page you have efe rd fr s

412
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:29,109
 tn edward there you can search our lanes and also to find

413
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,949
 proposals well there he was sharing and

414
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,359
 liked in the chat that they are seeing the slack if it happens after the game to

415
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:46,520
 slack lets speight been but if it happened by fact

416
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,340
 gonzález the link with the direct invite 16

417
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,000
 perfect and now we have a few minutes left but

418
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,910
 to close we are going to ask some more questions we are going to take a few

419
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,200
 questions from the public so if you want to ask some questions let's go

420
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,089
 to be doing them before the closing of

421
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,710
 this this first segment I do something related more than anything

422
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:19,530
 to the work environment not because you are not passing from the beginning the

423
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,070
 beginnings for people who have a little more experience because of it because

424
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:27,220
 we weren't talking much if you want mining

425
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,569
 and it is not necessary either because there are a lot of companies that have the

426
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,430
 ability to see that with all the labor demand in the world of

427
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,348
 security and here sometimes much more is provided than training a

428
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:46,780
 person who is very proactive self-taught for different periods of several months or

429
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,920
 the time it takes before you spend a lot of resources searching

430
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,359
 a person with a fairly specific profile and who could not in Cordoba

431
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,730
 Would it be achieved or not it would be repositioned that depends on how each company handles it

432
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,770
 no, but sometimes there are companies that have that vision

433
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,619
 but they see that opportunity to me for example that happened to me so I say that

434
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:13,119
 there are companies that ask such questions that in

435
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,920
 How do they consider the current security market to be in an ethical way?

436
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,210
 córdoba specifically and says in a way that they can advise you

437
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,109
 someone so you can have your first beginnings having knowledge

438
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:32,308
 or without having knowledge

439
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:41,740
 of course please at a business level there are several companies that already have their

440
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,439
 security department here in córdoba well in my case I work in a company

441
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,840
 telecommunications and we have the security area is prominent and part in

442
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,599
 Buenos Aires I also know there are companies that

443
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:06,590
 that they have Jesus has his suggestion also here in

444
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,240
 Córdoba also has the digital part in Buenos Aires, well we have a

445
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,180
 company that remains of antivirus that is here in Cordoba also good that it is more

446
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:25,830
 space and I think that within the scope of security it was already about

447
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:30,009
 45 years and older as companies are realizing that the

448
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:35,740
 safety is very very important when that where we have more participation

449
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,399
 and we also have the possibility of working outside

450
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,810
 thus making being remote more what is security that can be worked

451
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:52,240
 freely to go if I would like to stop here to tell a little

452
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,819
 at least from my perspective and I know that it is something that I have done has stayed with

453
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,840
 compare and that I think something that happened to people who

454
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,960
 putting have work experience in the world of computer insurance is that

455
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,310
 from the pole minus the point of view of someone who has conducted audits in

456
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:14,480
 the past and worked consulting at the beginning of the companies

457
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,500
 at least the clients with whom I was lucky or more fortunate to

458
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,880
 bumping me depends on how you want to see it

459
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,868
 if they did not have a budget to spare now that they had to spare or did not see the

460
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:32,270
 computer security as something necessary was having a change not of this same

461
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:37,790
 left that I say that it is being done that remains you have to leave it later

462
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,490
 what does it share that the community shares and a lot of companies of

463
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,729
 computer insurance that are specifically said to raise awareness of companies

464
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,510
 and others later they were realizing that it was

465
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:52,190
 something they needed and until the day when many

466
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,560
 companies would encourage me from most of the

467
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,650
 Large companies today have their own team decided to inform and here

468
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,480
 They are even separated into red team and blood in, so good if I don't want to later

469
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,460
 expand on that but it's basically 1 defense and another attack for

470
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,990
 generate robust security policies within an organization that is

471
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:18,689
 also explained in the fax that we share that is very good because

472
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,740
 the game only opens up more to the fact that there are companies hiring roles

473
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,000
 about computing without being a specifically computer security company

474
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,839
 I wanted to say something not exactly from the hand what you are mentioning

475
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,060
 It is true that I also perceived it doing audits

476
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,410
 Before really we were the last ear of the jar and if there is a

477
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,160
 budget knife there let's see what these guys can do to see if

478
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,399
 They find something and that was mutating a lot, it has even happened to me

479
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,280
 recently listen to companies that place a lot of importance on it and have

480
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,390
 mentioned in calls that I have had for them how good that as happened to their

481
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,540
 competition something a similar problem an attack of rands humor or something by the

482
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,040
 style and saw the economic impact that was obtained in that company they do not have to

483
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,869
 the space so they are beginning to be is being much more forward-looking

484
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:18,349
 and going back to the first part of your question let's say it happened to me

485
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,869
 personally, which is precisely from hacker space, many

486
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:23,720
 companies that also wanted to show what they did because sometimes it is difficult

487
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,700
 give you visibility and what you are doing that are companies

488
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,299
 new and I am also very surprised by the fact that there are so many companies

489
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,380
 security that is also stationed in Cordoba not only typical of here from

490
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,130
 Córdoba but they are a multinational company and have offices here

491
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:45,020
 also and I think there is a gigantic labor market that is to say there is a lot of

492
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,920
 demand and I also know it because a security company works and there is a

493
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,520
 very large demand of trained people is security

494
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,030
 For this reason, there are also quite extensive training programs and

495
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:00,200
 pretty aggressive I would say so the people who are getting into this

496
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,220
 form as quickly as possible and walk away almost immediately

497
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,390
 we also from the company where I work we try to train

498
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:14,220
 the best people and as quickly as possible because the end of the job is

499
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,270
 very big to the point that sometimes we can't cope

500
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,359
 so well yes yes yes your concerns if there is or is not work

501
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,380
 in an ethical way know that there is and there is a lot I am talking about the more

502
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,630
 of the rating part of the offensive audit part but within all

503
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,810
 the branches of computer surfing there is a lot of work if I had to say

504
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:38,250
 the minimum requirements of all these trainings from which the

505
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,210
 company has to work like this and peer companies out there maybe that

506
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:46,380
 Cordoba itself, what would be the minimum requirements for all these

507
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,720
 different levels of introductions to companies with programs such as so that

508
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,859
 people security and well me with being in such a year of university for it

509
00:41:55,859 --> 00:42:00,598
 I have this knowledge or I think what it is they would need to know and how good it is

510
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,690
 the whole university is that for me or one of the most important things is to have

511
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,010
 fairly solid basic knowledge working knowledge understand what

512
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,950
 what are the protocols how they work and from there to start uploading a lot

513
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:18,210
 in a lot of areas your lean is supposed to be more to the side of

514
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,739
 good audit understand how a web server works how it works different

515
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:26,190
 foreign wars web or how the suction cups work and so on and after

516
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,660
 start to see how things fail sun come on I think it is very very useful and

517
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,249
 a lot of value to read a lot about security ethical way there are a lot of forums and

518
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:41,209
 a lot of very interesting things one that I usually read a lot is net sec de

519
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:46,440
 network radio and thanks to the fact that it is excellent the excellent grace can

520
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,609
 order by priority because people already start making the pattern and we go to this

521
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:56,910
 seems the most interesting of all kinds of skills and quite a lot is very very

522
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,160
 because of that, nothing seems to me that they are really interested in the top

523
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,450
 computing saying that it is a super dynamic environment nothing gives it a lot is

524
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,649
 try to keep up with the mobility that is coming out that is very useful for the

525
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,519
 companies because it is true that companies can be affected by old bugs

526
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:18,040
 but the reality is that the most immediate things are always

527
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,080
 and of greater impact so nothing I think is also some way to show that

528
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:29,230
 are up to date and are reading and seeing what is happening in the

529
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,100
 computer habituation is also making certifications that endorse that

530
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,890
 knowledge either a university degree or a certain damage in

531
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,160
 the race and well and yes later if they can go

532
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,379
 accompanied by certifications that validate other knowledge that you

533
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,579
 they are doing it would also be great but good obviously with this no but yes that

534
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:54,869
 they are exclusive things of course that it seems to me that if you somehow

535
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:58,589
 Also in the interviews it will happen that they will see technical tests is

536
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:02,190
 basically like a mini set and a mini caps ref what are those challenges

537
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,760
 and they will try to greet him and in that more or less I at least

538
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,910
 personally what comes that he does not see so much the result as if he is not going to

539
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:13,259
 to be able to solve that so much does not interest me what interests me is to see

540
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,160
 how the way of thinking tries to solve it and even if it cannot solve it

541
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,240
 all the things you did to try to solve what you did to me is a lot of value

542
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,578
 that shows the way of thinking of the person well and from the side he has it

543
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:31,230
 a bit this in by and have supervised professional practices or some

544
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,560
 agreement to a company do not have against a sumo

545
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,830
 but in particular we have had several meetings with companies from the medium and

546
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:47,850
 even fabián is an advisor and is working on aspects related to

547
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:54,299
 security and what is not less that has happened within our faculty and

548
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:00,930
 that Fabián is leading is a research group in training in training

549
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,549
 we call them within the academic environment until it is approved by the

550
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,270
 formal statutes that we have the boards of directors the boards

551
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,759
 departmental but in reality in a group in formation with a set of

552
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,320
 graduate student teachers that they have already been working on

553
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,740
 security and that has it all by participating in meetings with

554
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:29,069
 companies because that also makes our community grow so

555
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,800
 could in that it seems to me that it has a lot to hide

556
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,750
 become a bit about that experience yeah

557
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,470
 Go ahead

558
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,009
 well in the case from utm we have a group that we have been coming for a long time

559
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:55,340
 working on research projects that have been presented just this

560
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:00,320
 project with the opportunity to demonstrate it in some cases in visas and

561
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,700
 Well, the eneco will also have a representative from the laboratory giving a

562
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,980
 of the talks telling their experiences and others that I think are ideal where we have

563
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:17,450
 joined a combination of students with engineers and from there it would be little

564
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:21,350
 towards the market of love doing from transfer of what one goes

565
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:26,360
 working researching relating to the different organizations and

566
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,410
 companies which are also related to the subject as I speak

567
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:35,359
 there Carlos the people of mcafee who at times opened the door for us to

568
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:41,840
 also motivate the boys to take them there good that they see a way of

569
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,880
 I work a proposal from a company that stood out

570
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,340
 and also obviously good services that one can provide through the

571
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,680
 precisely systems department where the same companies for that reason

572
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:04,210
 request certain types of advice or where what they require is

573
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,200
 some good way like recommending some kind of staff or

574
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:14,620
 people for the necessary resources the truth that we are growing I think not

575
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,180
 It is only tn but Cordoba is growing from every point of view of the

576
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,049
 safety aspect this totally strengthens the roads we want

577
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:29,740
 marking as a group we have grown a lot it has taken us time it is not a theme

578
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,890
 It is not the main theme of the university obviously it is a

579
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:39,100
 university but we have been working to form a strong team with con

580
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,410
 I really want to, mainly I think that is the word that I rescue from your link

581
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,828
 What did you go through a while ago and I think that's where the

582
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:51,789
 strengthening the desire that not only the engineers but also the

583
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:56,619
 students and well anyone who wants to participate that allows this

584
00:47:56,619 --> 00:48:01,750
 grow from the formal point of view in what is research and from the point of view

585
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:07,680
 of view of maybe of knowledge linking us with not only

586
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,520
 organizations such as hacker space but also with companies and with other

587
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,750
 universities that we have also had the opportunity to be present in

588
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,549
 some other types of events with them so hey I think what it is

589
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:28,089
 extremely important is research not how to leave and not be scared with

590
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:32,130
 that word that out there seems to me to investigate is something totally

591
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:38,260
 academic and it is not what you want what you want and dig into that to

592
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:41,799
 get a knowledge and most importantly understand what one is

593
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:45,390
 doing but excellent part of what you want

594
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:52,150
 Fabian who mentioned turn to him the frequently asked questions this re

595
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,420
 can give up what happens now I'm going to do it again

596
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:00,070
 throw there in the tweet channel there are many of the questions that we

597
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,630
 are asking at this time that they are answered there are several questions that

598
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:10,000
 The answers are if the certifications are recommended or not what type of

599
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,570
 profiles are found in the world of work, which will be the basic

600
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:17,890
 you need to be able to run computer security if it makes sense

601
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,609
 not go to a conference how we see the future of security matías I saw that

602
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,680
 is another question they asked there is also a graphic map that I found no

603
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,129
 I remember the name of the person but it is cited in a source that shows

604
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,060
 all areas of security form ethical so that they can try to

605
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:40,660
 find out which area you resonate with the most so thank you all

606
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,210
 the people who are asking most of these questions in questions

607
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:48,460
 are there is a repository that basically belongs to the community for the

608
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,390
 community if you have not used git hub is a nice opportunity to use give

609
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:57,160
 up because you can send me modifications later I can test them and how it is text

610
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,578
 They can do it directly on the site so it is a nice approach and for the

611
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:04,690
 people who already know what pull requests are feel welcome from

612
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:09,520
 send me whatever they want that they think brings movie airs from

613
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:15,460
 courses we are adding as it happens in some

614
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,550
 of the podcasts we have conferences that are held in Argentina there is a

615
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:26,200
 collection of different types of twitter communities that we have

616
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:34,129
 in adjusted and that is one of the last sections at the end of article iv
