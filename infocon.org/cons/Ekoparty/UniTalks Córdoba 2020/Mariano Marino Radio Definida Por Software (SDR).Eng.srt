1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,439
good how are you a caste back congratulations to yle and yesterday for the

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:13,110
 talk very good very good questions and now we have it to mariano marino the

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,590
 everest ninja unveiled green with more than 20 years of experience developing

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,489
 industrial and commercial systems and you're not going to be talking about radio

5
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:27,749
 sdr software defined so marian welcome and all yours

6
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:30,929
 we did good thank you so much for everything

7
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:37,260
 I share with good size started or more saying the talk

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,070
 Suppose we say that with a single inexpensive device you can listen

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,829
 these radio signals analyze it without coding them now that it is terrific

10
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,609
 If you listened correctly, it is with only one we are used to having multiple

11
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:57,780
 products and each one fulfilling a single function, this case is different because the

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,920
 It is true that if you want them to listen to music, you can do it, which is to watch

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,880
 television also attracts your attention the weather satellites

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,479
 You can also download all the images you want and if they are media

15
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,869
 You don't want to analyze if your baby's baby call is safe too

16
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,569
 You can do some analysis and if you are interested in knowing how to do it, I can

17
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,799
 ensure that it is not complex for Maria but enables the

18
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,250
 camera and with

19
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,670
 and with little budget you can start in the world of sdr

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,700
 so in this talk we are going to see what it is that you can do what are the

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,860
 things that are needed and what tools do you have to install to

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,810
 be able to start I'm going to start this talk by making a

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,720
 observation I am a programmer and a hobbyist

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,520
 radio world clarified because it is not the same as being a radio amateur and

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,720
 out there that lack is parties allows me to transmit certain with certain concepts

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,979
 from a close look at that of a programmer and when you start programming

27
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:11,100
 as most I did from a high level language and that abstraction

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,980
 it did not allow me to know how things were implemented at the

29
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,230
 hardware when I started to build and fix computers only then did I know

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,239
 what was happening behind those lines of code that I wrote

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,790
 more than 10 years ago arbancón with my partner a local fm so I had to

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,320
 choose itself transmitter processor antennas cables microphones console a

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,820
 a lot of hardware and the truth was that it was a fairly accelerated course

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,890
 for me from which of course I learned a lot at that time I was

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,720
 like just like this programmer learning just a language of

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,910
 high level understood that the processor output an mpx signal which is the one that

37
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,890
 the transmitter entered that the pilot signal light should be on or that the

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,820
 the led that marked the input signal should not blink too much so as not to

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,510
 distort the audio that we transmitted and that mainly the roe had it

40
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,410
 control to prevent the car from fear the power transistor

41
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,820
 I do not know if any Cordoba knows the Jardine firm that the transmitter is from there and

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,370
 well now well it was not until the appearance of the s of green that each part

43
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,170
 it was not a black box it had an input output and an established processing

44
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,059
 it was more complex than that especially when like when I wanted to configure a

45
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,370
 radio software surely passed that initial income to many

46
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:46,060
 If you ever install any now, well that fm signal that we transmitted in the

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,050
 listeners received them on their radio for everyone it was transparent for us

48
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,400
 we inject the audio into the transmitter for listeners tuned into the

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
 frequencies and listen to the music but for all that to happen they require

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,160
 a series of processes or parts implemented at the hardware level such as

51
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,040
 those that are removed in the image we can find modulators and the

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,850
 specifically designed amplifier mixer decoders

53
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,709
 for the band in which the radio operates and for many components of the

54
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,990
 system is not only that but also for example for the

55
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,740
 transmitter and antenna that were closed dipoles are bought

56
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,630
 specifically tuned for 107.1 which gives the frequencies that

57
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,170
 we transmitted

58
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:38,539
 Well, a few years ago these species appeared, you will depend on and cheap that you

59
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:44,568
 allow you to watch TV to listen to fm and receive gps signals on the computer

60
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,469
 radio signals that were spaced from each other in the

61
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:52,699
 radioelectric spectrum beyond all those chairs that for many can

62
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,649
 be unknown, the interesting thing is that you could decode signals from 64

63
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:03,589
 megahertz up to 1,700 meters a fairly wide spectrum for a single

64
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:09,169
 cheap device what can be observed was that it could be ordered from the

65
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,519
 integrated circuit that did all the magic of the tapes of the

66
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,109
 tuning you will tune to any frequency and the result was

67
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,340
 a machine that a digital photo of the signal

68
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,138
 activity then what if the parts implemented at the hardware level

69
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,300
 in an fm receiver or transmitter are made at the software level and use of this

70
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,590
 device as an input of the radio signal or do the same with the

71
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,520
 television with a satellite with a control of an alarm and so on and the

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,359
 The truth is that the concept of giving in is not a new concept but precisely

73
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,830
 the new thing was that you could use a very crazy device to take it to

74
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,139
 we are talking about a team of about 20 30 dollars and others so and

75
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,879
 apart they get it easy by mercadolibre it is not that they have to do

76
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,150
 too many things to find what sdr sounds

77
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,380
 ncr is a system where certain components of radio communication

78
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:19,350
 they are implemented by software so well I'll start when

79
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,730
 introduction I will make a brief introduction and in this I will have the

80
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,360
 challenge to present a lot of technical concepts for those who do not

81
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,270
 meet radio so those who know please

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,130
 Now why do I have to do an introduction?

83
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,330
 simplified so keep that in mind and well and I'll try to give

84
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,950
 some examples so that it is understood well it started with 15 damages good

85
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,280
 Radio waves travel at a speed the speed of light that is

86
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,349
 of about 300,000 kilometers per second is an important data because there it is

87
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,060
 they give off many formulas they spread in a shared medium such as air

88
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:04,260
 agree 6 shares can also be propagated in a vacuum

89
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,370
 the high of the wave one second

90
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:15,979
 the top of the wave is called the amplitude, the top is called the crest and the

91
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:28,840
 the bottom part is called the valley the width of the wave is called the cycle and that is what

92
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,929
 which denominates the k wavelength a cycle is composed by starting from

93
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:41,590
 zero times a crest a valley and its return to zero and the frequency is the amount of

94
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,229
 cycles per second that the wave has and the unit and unit of measurements card

95
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,610
 and there is a peculiarity that at low frequencies in the waves they are

96
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,919
 guided by the earth's surface and reflected by the ionosphere instead

97
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,840
 at high frequencies it has a behavior similar to that of light

98
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,840
 in reflection it is one of the characteristics of waves

99
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,039
 electromagnetic any object that does not absorb the power of the wave by

100
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,860
 example a metal will reflect it will reflect it as if it were light the mirror

101
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,419
 of auto and in this case the angles of incidence and reflection remain

102
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:26,419
 equal thanks to this principle is the one that we can use parabolic dishes to

103
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,979
 improve antenna performance

104
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,848
 and well, this is all out there in the second year or in the elementary school where you can see

105
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,330
 but when the light is passed through one hole we will meet the other

106
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,470
 side of a perfect figure to the same but we will find a figure

107
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,920
 distorted the same occurs when a wave colliding with an edge modifies its

108
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,719
 trajectory and in that modification of trajectory that creative loses power

109
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,310
 is called distraction although it is present throughout the spectrum the more

110
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,599
 the frequency is lower, the diffraction effect is more noticeable and when it is more

111
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:13,120
 high there are more power losses this effect seems strange but thanks to it

112
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,490
 allows in certain situations to bend electromagnetic waves

113
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,910
 and this happens for example when they pass through a mountain

114
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:30,009
 dispersion is also another characteristic that occurs when a

115
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:35,169
 wave collides smaller objects which is a wave attitude causing part of

116
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,920
 that energy radiated in those directions

117
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,349
 that have as reference for 300 trips the titles of one millimeter

118
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:51,240
 for a trip of 30 centimeters and for 300 girls it is one millimeter now well

119
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,050
 If you want to complicate the most there is the effect of multi path multi peace

120
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,620
 gift that implies that the same wave is received by the receiver in different

121
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,470
 times and this is because the wave travels through different paths and that is a

122
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,440
 example for example some signal of telephone or an antenna of firm

123
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,570
 broadcasting and hitting a bunch of buildings and what's the subject of this that

124
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,310
 this effect plays in this phenomenon plays an important role in networks

125
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,810
 wireless due to delays and interference caused by

126
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,989
 imagine yourself in an office or at home on the signs bouncing everywhere

127
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,760
 so that it finds the pair that bounces so if you are thinking about the place that

128
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,180
 you are going to install your wireless router, think of one whose geometry does not

129
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,390
 causes a lot of reflections, distractions and scattering

130
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,160
 the radioelectric spectrum is the set of all waves

131
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,050
 electromagnetic because it was created because it allows to simplify the study and

132
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,680
 then they are divided into bands to which the maximum maximum was established

133
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,390
 relevance the most interesting frequencies in this case will surely be

134
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:12,930
 in which they are hf and vhf and hf that are those that go from the 3 megahertz to the

135
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:18,269
 3 gigabytes in those bands we include everything that s

136
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,879
 nfc like v satellite images skandi ham radio remote control

137
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:30,689
 auto home automation or motor alarms wifi bluetooth phones

138
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:36,540
 cell phones television that is, you have a lot of things about bands

139
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,839
 lower than hf we find for example what

140
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,230
 It would be a radio to me after the identification cards

141
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,990
 personal that we use to get into work and then between 20 hearts and 20

142
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,870
 kilos arts is the audio that our ears hear about that hf that

143
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,430
 It would be the super super high frequency of the super high for which if we find

144
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,459
 radars and long-range links where that good later I will explain

145
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,260
 why we can find in that range of high frequencies and the

146
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,220
 satellite communications above a gig are known as a microwave

147
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,120
 which are also divided into bands on canvas that listen when naming the

148
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,900
 ku band that is that they are used by digital television in the

149
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,590
 satellite but

150
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,830
 and well nothing so far little theory of how radio waves work for that

151
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:36,370
 its characteristics and well let's see a little about the hardware issue

152
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,859
 going down the district is the device that we are going to buy to have

153
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,900
 Take into account if if one wants to only receive signals, transmit them

154
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,799
 or both on the other hand we need to know if

155
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,040
 tune the frequency in question to what we are going to analyze for example a

156
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,179
 r8 22 allows us to decode bluetooth signals wi-fi wiki is seen what

157
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:07,720
 It is above the gigabytes so the moment of choosing the car was red with

158
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,490
 that how

159
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,370
 then well nothing that seems strange in the device that is down there the

160
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:21,290
 right a usb vga adapter that contains inside a fresh chip

161
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,250
 logic fl 2000 can be used to transmit some radio signals like

162
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,820
 fm of digital transmission of digital television what it weighs and if they need to do

163
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,920
 something else but buy a hacker efe line law that allows you to tune in

164
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,579
 a larger spectrum of frequencies and also use and receive signals

165
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,329
 before going on saying the antennas and the links I wanted to show you a little

166
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:52,219
 of the connectors that are used in rf these are some and it is only shown

167
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,329
 In one of its versions, that is, for each of the connectors there is the

168
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:59,839
 version is the male and female version is the one can easily print the

169
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
 saints and play a memo t is the time of they are a lot although after they finish

170
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,750
 using two or three luckily in which reflex are two the most common

171
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,860
 the 59 axis and the flex the difference lies in their construction and in the

172
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,190
 power that can lead to the position of the antenna cable for all cables yes

173
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,960
 please have to take into account this must have an impedance of 58

174
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,890
 so that nothing is broken and notice that it is written on the n the sheath of the

175
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,160
 cable

176
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,600
 good is an important part if there are communications of the antenna if not

177
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,170
 chooses well even the best team towards water plan has who sends the

178
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,019
 electricity from air to air ground forgive the cable or vice versa

179
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:53,069
 then basically energy is captured cannot be manufactured from something that is not

180
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:58,378
 it is a conductor of energy it seems an old one but hey antennas there are for everyone

181
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,380
 the tastes if they are chosen according to the needs of the project

182
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,540
 some cases it is due some cases for example in some project it is due

183
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,260
 distribute the possible signal the radiated power in others is channeled

184
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,540
 in the specific direction and well and that is where you are choosing according to

185
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,680
 those characteristics of the antenna that suits better if you use one or the other

186
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,680
 these are students are not all of the antennas there is one

187
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,939
 selection stack in carnival have four characteristics

188
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,089
 The first is the radiation pattern that

189
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,080
 is the three-dimensional figure that shows how the antenna behaves at the moment of

190
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,450
 vary the transmitted power a pattern is presented in two drawings

191
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,390
 horizontal and the other vertical pattern if we add the two patterns we make the

192
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:57,029
 three-dimensional drawing of how the antenna works now well if he if the pattern

193
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:04,100
 of the horizontal drawing is one or we are facing an omnidirectional antenna

194
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,730
 means that it will transmit everywhere in the same way if I draw a

195
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:15,170
 pattern of 8 is a bidirectional and otherwise it is a directional the

196
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,979
 Another other characteristic is the gain, which is the relationship between the power that

197
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,000
 the transmitting equipment came out and was actually emitting it through the antenna in one direction

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,860
 particular then we have the directivity which is the ability of the

199
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,200
 antenna in directing the energy to a specific direction the polarization that

200
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,220
 is the orientation of the electromagnetic waves leaving the antenna

201
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,160
 Here is an example of directivity between two antennas very

202
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,010
 different from each other one one tries to distribute the signal as much as possible

203
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:58,480
 and the other to direct it in one direction although they take into account that with equal power

204
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,800
 transmission with greater directivity at a greater distance

205
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,470
 and less directivity less at a distance, that is, we cannot transmit for all

206
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:14,230
 sides thinking that we will arrive in the same way as another type before by another

207
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,280
 side of the antenna has a bandwidth that is the range of frequencies in

208
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,579
 the one that therefore operates an antenna by then 144 mg does not serve me for

209
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,079
 receive wifi signals

210
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:35,520
 and good in the simulation you can see in the upper part that is

211
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,158
 opted for a 13v 13tv 13 antenna should

212
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,399
 and in optimal situations it means that

213
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:52,889
 no, I don't have any object in the middle making noise, you can't get any more

214
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:56,459
 8% transmission speed of the equipment

215
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,710
 On the other hand, if you opted for a weak 35 antenna, the link works correctly

216
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,660
 Knowing 100% the transmission speed is all the certainty that when

217
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,630
 same equipment same power different antenna the results are different

218
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:18,489
 and like a pair of 3-d glasses the antenna can filter the waves to

219
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:25,210
 that come out with a certain direction there are two types of polarization that are

220
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,249
 apply to the antennas one of them the linear one that includes vertical horizontal and

221
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:35,710
 oblique on the other hand we have the circular that includes right circular

222
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,090
 circular left elliptical right and elliptical left be careful with

223
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,109
 This is because to maximize the performance of the antennas it is necessary to

224
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:48,869
 choose the same polarity as the transmitting antenna

225
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,049
 another important aspect is the fresh mail the fregen is the ellipse formed between two

226
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:03,049
 antennas that must be clear of obstacles the image can see two

227
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:08,370
 fresnel zones in a second group of the pointer of the

228
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,239
 The first area to be delimited by the green line is the

229
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,390
 area where the signal strength is most affected if an object interferes and

230
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,840
 then the second part which is the one formed between the green line the line

231
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,000
 orange in interference affects but not so much

232
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,930
 as in the first front zone after the second the second part of the

233
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,600
 second zone up or down and the interference becomes

234
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,919
 negligible can compare the two simulations in

235
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,150
 this case also works in the image on the left where if there are objects that

236
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,290
 interfere with the link, the quality does not decrease much, achieving a rate of

237
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:03,159
 45 percent vs. 100 percent transfer on clean link now

238
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,550
 well if you look at the fresnel radius to

239
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,280
 different frequencies can see the difference

240
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:18,590
 and nothing do they remember what when I told them

241
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,110
 like me that in the long-range links it has been needed are teams with

242
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,159
 much frequency is precisely because the higher the frequency

243
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,440
 smaller is the ray of the ellipse allowing to choose tower heights

244
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,970
 lower, that is, for a 10-kilometer link between equipment that works

245
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:44,960
 in 2.4 and 5.8 there is a whole tower section 6 meters apart

246
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,010
 now to look down here for a second notice that for the frequency of 900

247
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:57,980
 messengers that are teams in them on a 10-kilometer link you have a one

248
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:05,149
 in front of a radius of 28 meters almost 29 instead one sees 5.4 only 11 meters

249
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:10,189
 so this is starting from level 0 I need to climb 11 meters to not have

250
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:17,600
 noise and that line that forms in the radius should not have any object that

251
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,010
 break to improve link capacity

252
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,990
 to finish let's say this comment is not directed at terrorists to

253
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,320
 two boys ss electro group but the curvature of the

254
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,490
 land plays a key role in long-distance links

255
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,290
 because basically it raises to the height of all intermediate objects i.e.

256
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:44,990
 if halfway there I have a 30-meter tree and I contemplated it as an object

257
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,950
 30 meters depends on depending on the distance from the towers is the object

258
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,910
 can actually represent on an object about 40 or 50 meters or more than

259
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:01,210
 obstacles then be careful with this navas

260
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,870
 the good in an analyzed video the light decreases to

261
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,379
 As we increase the indication of darkness this means that if there is

262
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,760
 little attenuation will further distinguish the difference between keys and dark

263
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,879
 Now, if you look at the 5% case, you can practically not distinguish what

264
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,320
 is what is on the other side of the glass in the ray probe we have the same

265
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,899
 The effect is called attenuation and depending on the material where they must pass through Madrid

266
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,200
 that radio signals must pass is the reduction of the transmitted power

267
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,600
 the termination is measured in decibels and these are some cases for example in

268
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,040
 materials such as glass dry wood take into account dry theorizing the

269
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,840
 Attenuation is low, on the other hand, in important structures of

270
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,669
 brick or plasterboard in addition to attenuation is medium and even the

271
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,960
 The monkey is the one who is good, the quality, the people themselves also have

272
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,410
 Average attenuation too much when in a group of people

273
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,009
 after for example a forest of leafy fingering the rain and others

274
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:16,219
 for example I do not know a fence I say makes the signal power included

275
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:21,200
 considerably almost starting losing the links and

276
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,480
 and there is the one to forget that metallic structures are elements

277
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,600
 structural of a house like beams slabs sheet metal roofs texas ie

278
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,469
 anything based on cement sand and electrowelded mesh or with iron in its

279
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,600
 interior become an impenetrable chaco for signs of

280
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,428
 wireless there is no chance that it will happen so none of this is they are in your house two

281
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:50,990
 floors in the wifi signal does not reach the top exactly the slab so we do not

282
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,940
 allow to get to absolutely nothing above that is why it is always recommended

283
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:01,710
 segment the teams and put more than one other characteristic of the links

284
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,330
 basically the radio signals are in the specifications of the techniques of

285
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,340
 teams always indicate if a team is los or en elos and what it wants

286
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,840
 say with this if the team by the frequency at which it works needs

287
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,669
 line of sight to be able to function and by this I mean that not only

288
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,679
 teams look, that is, all the binoculars and I say even the team but

289
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,240
 that also that the fresh men zone must be respected

290
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,590
 otherwise a team in them does not require line of sight but neither

291
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,360
 works miracles does not do magic normally one team in the other works in

292
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,760
 frequencies lower than the equipments or diffraction in the characteristic

293
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,220
 of the waves and the dispersion of the same for this reason can be ensured in the

294
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,590
 in situations where other teams can't but won't work miracles if you already

295
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,289
 I have a super barrier of vegetation do not want the signal to pass

296
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:05,799
 quietly out there

297
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:14,610
 well doppler effect doppler effect occurs when a signal is transmitted in

298
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:20,010
 movement is transmitted or received that signal in movement and that is to say if if the

299
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,980
 attendance of 30 is my only and the receiver gets smaller

300
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,610
 means that the signal is compressed by accelerating its frequency instead if the

301
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,540
 distance is enlarged the signal is expanded by decreasing the frequency this effect

302
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,240
 is present when we listen to music also in the car what happens is that the

303
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,230
 frequency shift is so small that it ends up being imperceptible and

304
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,179
 imperceptible so but things change when we want to download the images

305
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:58,100
 in the satellite images sent by the space station and the one that is seen

306
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,879
 down there in the photo yes well if you do not know in it travels at a speed

307
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,460
 of 7,600 meters per second something like a return to earth in 93

308
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,120
 minutes then that shift is no longer so

309
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,449
 imperceptible and should be adjusted because they fit because if you look at the

310
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,080
 image in this image you can see how it gives the

311
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,129
 signal runs away

312
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:33,309
 so good that out there is compensated by taking more signal using more width of

313
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:39,010
 band to be able to adjust the line later so that it is not

314
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,170
 a curve and counter-curve but it is a straight line

315
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:50,910
 Well enough theory, let's take it to the blue that is then ask what does it do

316
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:57,120
 more than one good now therefore I will not explain how to hack it but yes

317
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,179
 I'm going to show you that communication can be heard a few meters from

318
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,700
 distance I take out the steel pointer

319
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:13,370
 this signal itself that you will surely not hear

320
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:20,090
 It could be seen that it is perfect, it is clean, it is perfectly distinguished in the

321
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,539
 courses where the signal is energized and it is about validating certain that it is state

322
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:31,789
 not present and when it is present as it is as the line of

323
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:35,049
 transfer of information

324
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:40,669
 and then here in 6 and a half meters away

325
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:45,670
 so imagine the islands nfc means

326
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,410
 have short-range communications manager that imply that the need to

327
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,710
 that the tag is next to the reader at a maximum distance of 10 centimeters

328
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,290
 what happens is that what they don't tell you is that once they give me the induction

329
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,190
 electromagnetic necessary for the crystal are those radio signals

330
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:09,750
 They travel a greater distance than the one I mentioned recently 10 centimeters

331
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,279
 so it's good to know for when you want

332
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:18,119
 and analyze anything it is not necessary to put the antenna on the side and more

333
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,259
 they can safely throw it about four meters away and if there is no

334
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:27,649
 too much noise there in the area of ​​your house

335
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,820
 they will be able to listen to the tuning over software flights as soon as the

336
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,189
 software for all tastes in linux windows android what they need and

337
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:43,019
 dividing exterior of two categories general purpose of research in the

338
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,879
 first I get a signal with playing the frequency format modulation and the width

339
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:53,129
 signal band if we go to investigation we can now we can

340
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:57,149
 decode the signal and if the hardware allows it

341
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:01,738
 together with the ship with which to transmit it to part of these

342
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:06,779
 There are other more specialized tools and this list is not

343
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,820
 find on the web the url that is down there

344
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,509
 and one thing they should do is first if they have the common devices is

345
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:21,649
 download the sadiq, which is the software that allows you to change the drivers that

346
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:26,768
 exist automatically by specials for sdr

347
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:35,080
 As for the configuration we are going to see some things like this

348
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,100
 first what will they have to do when they open a software

349
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,820
 and how the sampling is configured and how the delivered signal is represented

350
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:55,840
 the level is simple rate which is the number of samples per second the

351
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,399
 accuracy of the measurement signal how good to be able to get a little more than

352
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:07,510
 precision signal to the lord received after in the whole line part

353
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:12,760
 the mixer link on the pga are the amplifiers the

354
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,710
 first the lma is the one that is closest to the

355
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:23,649
 to the antenna is the one that has the task of raising that signal that comes, which is very

356
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:30,010
 very very low to as much as possible without adding noise in the mixer is a

357
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,799
 radio frequency signal mixer and finally chosen towards him is the

358
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,080
 last amplifier that delivers that signal

359
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:47,940
 Now, how is this signal received in the signal that I just commented?

360
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,379
 when you analyze the information that passes through a cable for example using

361
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:58,408
 one if he copied them we have a 2d measurement of montane that is, it is the magnitude of the

362
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:04,080
 signal per unit of time but if we see the signal received by the antennas in a

363
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,250
 given moment is a more complex signal so not only is the magnitude

364
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:17,110
 of the signal, let's say its power but also the phase in which it is

365
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:23,100
 the signal the received signal is called cicu

366
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:30,760
 and by amplitude of the signal or by the phase and in each in each job it was delivered

367
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,930
 complex numbers composed of two values ​​in which the y is the real number

368
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,510
 and the cube is the imaginary one, this is very broad, if you want, you can

369
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,430
 go much deeper with this

370
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,600
 as for the software this is a special sdr

371
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:55,620
 on the main screen what we will see in the center is the analyzer

372
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,689
 spectrum which is the instantaneous signal in real time

373
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:10,530
 then down waterford which is the a jean guitton waterfall which is the

374
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:17,399
 historical spectrum then we have the mbx signal which is the multiplexed signal

375
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,730
 commercial cpm intermediate frequency

376
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,540
 that is obtained from mixing the signal tuned in the antenna with a

377
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:33,690
 frequency generated by a local asylee and that graph shows

378
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:40,750
 the differences between the two and then the audio analyzer

379
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:48,430
 how good it shows in the left part the bass sounds in the part of the

380
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:55,930
 center the average dreams like the human nail and in the in the part of the

381
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:02,200
 right the sharp dressings and well we have on the bar after

382
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,870
 above some indicators to be able to change

383
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:11,030
 the frequencies increase the volume configure the device and here we can

384
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:17,810
 enable some more tools and then on the left we have the menu

385
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,679
 configuration here well in this version precisely

386
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,320
 developing there are a lot of plugins that add a lot of value for being

387
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,780
 encoders and others and on the right side to the configuration of what

388
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:39,010
 would be the views you are with the range the offset and others that what it allows is

389
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,120
 start to see this signal higher or lower to be able to

390
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:50,409
 better discriminate if it is a true signal webs are noise

391
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:58,820
 well in this this image here we see how it is formed by a

392
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:05,049
 fm signal in this part enables a pointer

393
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:10,299
 in this part are the two channels is the mono transmission for that reason

394
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:15,520
 is to be called in the mx because it is multiplexed, that is, in a signal it is

395
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,319
 they can encode a lot of signals in this case well this is the section where

396
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:25,480
 mono audio section the pilot signal is the one I told you at the time that

397
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,600
 came out had to give me on then assigned the stereo

398
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:39,370
 the exterior sign from the right to the left and this serial carachito is the

399
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:44,469
 rbs and there information is transmitted from the station, things of

400
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:50,799
 interest and other direct or need do not give them much importance because here in

401
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,199
 Argentina is not there, that is a project half owner microsoft so no

402
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,399
 don't give it too much importance

403
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,830
 we had talked well that in the configuration we have this

404
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:10,500
 part that is where we have to configure yes or yes what is the modulation

405
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,530
 in which the technique that allows coding

406
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,260
 the data in the radio signal any can be chosen any but it will

407
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,190
 depend on the characteristics of what we want us to want

408
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,670
 capture therefore we have to know if two and what are the

409
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,870
 technical specifications of what we are going to capture to choose the mode

410
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:41,490
 correct for example if we are facing a modulated frequency for example of a

411
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,379
 band a frequency a commercial fm radio we will have to select in

412
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:52,710
 this case wv m is cool is cool fm and if we go to it

413
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,980
 which would be for example in making an office radio transmission or what

414
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,830
 be a n m later if we want to listen to radio dna

415
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:07,460
 or short wave transmissions and more we will choose gm and others then

416
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,190
 Now later I am going to show you an example of what the

417
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,170
 features and others how to configure that after all the filters part

418
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,550
 normally they are not changed

419
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:25,609
 those little eyes applied to the signal in the bandwidth part that good that

420
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:33,249
 for a given frequency in this case for example 104.1 is the quantity

421
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,190
 the children of let's say lower and higher of the signal that is going to

422
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:44,430
 process the sketch that allows without designing to silence the signal so as not to

423
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:50,899
 listen to them there is a typical background day we are listening to something

424
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:59,740
 cw sweet and this is to serve lets say when decoded morse

425
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:08,450
 and well nothing the publication of always needs a base frequency called

426
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:14,629
 carrier or carrier that the sum of the two will give the result of the

427
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,280
 modulated signal and then in the final part let's say the

428
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,260
 noise reduction which is important with these settings as well as improving

429
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,440
 the quality of the received signal by eliminating background noise, improving

430
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,090
 the signal-to-noise ratio that is important to keep as far away

431
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,560
 possible superb noise signal possible

432
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,810
 When three come with of and others are the limits for these pressure of

433
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,350
 cibeles then you can configure the size of the sample window to

434
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,029
 be able to receive the noise

435
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:59,650
 good for example but let's go to the case of nfc in how it started

436
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:06,700
 first in main I will look look at the two specification sheets you have no

437
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,439
 I can do another thing that recommends this, let's say because it is what

438
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,180
 main here it says everything is said from how it is

439
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:23,200
 made the diagram the block of the circuit as is the modulation and others

440
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,220
 Well, this is all, it is the hour that it is important that the first person for now

441
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,459
 I hope a joy to venerate him that they face, let's say at the moment when

442
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,840
 I start a radio signal, for example, they do not remember what I said to him.

443
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,980
 of the modulations good in nfc modulations are more complicated no

444
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:44,890
 This standard is maintained, let's say between the reader and him and the tag, then they go

445
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,359
 changing chaotic medium sometimes because of electoral tag some are used for

446
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:57,580
 example to dsk with such speed with such encoding if that signal returns already

447
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:05,270
 100% return to sk with having such speed with

448
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,950
 such coding so therefore it is important that they know that because if

449
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,359
 well you are going to hear that signal and have tried to decode it, you need

450
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,460
 know how the signal is made

451
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:23,130
 we saw the forge we saw the modulation now we need to know how it is encoded

452
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,630
 that signal how an analog signal is transformed into ones and zeros in this in

453
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:35,490
 nfc case the encoding is used and the modified means that the 011 which

454
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:42,720
 good that we would start it is also if it is if it is zero the zero means that it passes

455
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:49,890
 the 10 and 11 of coded as 10 kilos nothing else there is the example but but

456
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:56,038
 that has to be programmed and finally to be able to decode it

457
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,509
 you need a script from this new radio or from other particular systems that

458
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:06,680
 think that they are not have a script and that's it, let's say oh what

459
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,930
 you have to assemble the filters you have to do the coding and then to

460
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:20,720
 Sometimes it seems simple, it has its logic, but you have to start doing.

461
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,770
 investigate it so flawless not over time

462
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:35,000
 yes very good the truth well with the spectacular time so look I have

463
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,569
 a couple of questions

464
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:44,410
 I want to clarify that tomorrow we are going to do a draw for one

465
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:50,710
 sdr so they can be noted in the links that were sent to them and one of the

466
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,450
 questions is there any sdr that you recommend to buy as for

467
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:02,100
 start inside the new state I have I have this

468
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,720
 in the image

469
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,430
 in the east golf and the truth I bought was

470
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,830
 cheap and it gave me good results, I tell you with this cable at six meters and

471
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:24,210
 I mean the signals especially so the truth is that it is good and allows me if

472
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:31,050
 for example in incorporating hf signal to be able to decode or listen

473
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:37,710
 signs of 125 kilos that are used by personal cards so in

474
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:43,560
 that and on the other hand I have a sdr line that is also good because it is full

475
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,990
 duplex has enough bandwidth and is good but you are already talking a

476
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:54,479
 equipment a little expensive more expensive recommended to recommend omar before recommend to assemble

477
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,859
 own antennas for each frequency or buy which are the best

478
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:05,420
 and if you do not have experience to buy it because building an antenna is like

479
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,130
 They all have to be very millimeter, you can't close it there because you are

480
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:17,260
 changing the frequency it is tuned to is antenna then to

481
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,480
 avoid any calculation problem for now if you are going to start if you buy

482
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,090
 the antenna then then start investigating and how they are assembled and make the

483
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:35,240
 own yours let's say but nothing out there buying a low antenna

484
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,450
 the level of frustration because for now, that of the antenna

485
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,770
 downloads and is a fundamental element in the transmission and I take the opportunity to say

486
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:48,560
 that sometimes in the ekoparty there is an antenna workshop too

487
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,299
 yes i have to ask how far it is

488
00:42:52,299 --> 00:43:00,220
 legal listening to radio communications decoding pacers is legal

489
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,098
 not if you are going to decode from decrypting signals getting into a legal problem

490
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:11,840
 all that is I do not know how to hear an fm signal from a headquarters or from one

491
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,910
 the fm receiver without problem but once how to decode the

492
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,480
 decrypt signals because I know what a league series are doing

493
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,630
 link here another question is how difficult is it

494
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,470
 take the amateur radio certification and what does it do to you?

495
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:35,919
 lets do it I have no idea because I'm not a radio amateur that's why

496
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,040
 beginning

497
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:47,150
 In all this is the usual research but on the other side

498
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:55,308
 There is a question in the chat I did I will be the same

499
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:03,869
 what wave with what circulates with the 5g signal if it affects the health of the idea

500
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:07,230
 not the truth that I have no idea I do not think there are too many studies that

501
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,730
 show if it is good or bad like all the signs in which when the

502
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:17,460
 minimum minimum exercise in the chat than in the radio club córdoba

503
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,799
 you can find out so that you have the link that I passed through fa

504
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:26,270
 e well there are some says that it does not affect the

505
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:32,970
 cheers so mariano I really appreciate that

506
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:38,509
 excellent talk good

507
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,970
 well my old man worked in telecommunications too

508
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:54,370
 then I was 10 years old I had to go up to the antenna I was skinny

509
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,220
 I do not have any questions

510
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,150
 and if there is an organization that organizes and controls radio frequency and

511
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:16,140
 rules for transmission if there is a peer each country in the access

512
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:23,769
 can i talk about sdr ctf if they are active radio page

513
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:30,939
 dotcom experimentation there are a couple of exercises and others to do are not

514
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:35,379
 need that duty is to simply listen to the audio and start

515
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:41,670
 to learn how these modulations and in addition to all these things that

516
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:50,770
 s ctv there is no more so its interesting how difficult it is to treat someone who

517
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,160
 this

518
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:59,290
 It is plan of encrypted signals as they were not made that so difficult

519
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:05,440
 mopping someone who is scanning for signs and breathing looking for their

520
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,090
 eyes and says spying and actually if he receives it and not

521
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:17,369
 transmits nothing is very difficult to know where the location is if transmitted

522
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:21,900
 It is easier because it poses six antennas and I lost directional months and then

523
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,450
 you can go sweeping or triangulating where what is the origin

524
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:32,220
 of those frequencies but if you are listening I simply do not know I do not know

525
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,859
 if there are safe ways to power

526
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:47,599
 we have some way of knowing if they have me a cloner near

527
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:55,170
 frequencies of cards for example as mine in that case what I

528
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:00,160
 I would recommend is that the anti cases use the cards

529
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,089
 so exactly what to put together a kind of

530
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:11,199
 Farah's box and that does not pass any type of frequencies is the only way

531
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:17,970
 Well, I don't have any more, I don't have any more questions.

532
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:27,270
 dbs of transmitting the garbage from today if here is like everything that transmits more

533
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:33,330
 Loud has the priority because basically those amps and so on

534
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:39,090
 with they last they go checking the frequency and the power of the

535
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:43,500
 reception and they are leveling off that signal now well if I transmit with low

536
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,420
 signal and someone comes with many signals like audio, let's say I give you a

537
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,770
 little speaker and another comes with the super buffet and all the music all

538
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,609
 which assumes the same can go unnoticed in radio signals happens

539
00:47:56,609 --> 00:48:01,109
 exactly the same who has the greatest power is the one who stays

540
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:07,380
 with that band and here we have what software was the

541
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,830
 simulation of the in radio frequency cr

542
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:18,020
 with that is the one to remove the wi antennas that the network has but there are several you put

543
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:24,680
 the micro tic simulation also have yours account has several in channel or

544
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,540
 pin has also directly the implan air that you can put the sets and

545
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,950
 other good it is not certain science that with that yes

546
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,790
 you put all the conditions and everything is fine they are based on satellite images

547
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:44,340
 It may be that there is something in the middle between the two antennas that

548
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,450
 satellite image do not take it into account but in this case if you want to do something

549
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:55,080
 510 kilometers or more if you have to do a kind of visual check if

550
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,640
 there is nothing that is making noise

551
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,140
 here I have the gray that can be done one afternoon tomorrow honey

552
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,580
 with radio frequency

553
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,640
 if there are several more who know how to do

554
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:18,569
 well we finished with the questions marian

555
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:25,290
 Thank you very much good since already giving the pass

556
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:30,720
 ah of course they will be talking they will present the next talk so let them

557
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:41,140
 I thank you all see you tomorrow many times so zero

558
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,849
