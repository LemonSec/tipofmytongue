1
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
etc

2
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
is

3
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
night

4
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
activity

5
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,560
let's talk about habits it's quite

6
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,039
amazing that we humans

7
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
tend to either consciously or

8
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
unconsciously pick up these kind of

9
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,639
habits

10
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
that in the end just starts to run our

11
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
lives

12
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,600
it it's kind of how we all do it

13
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,960
and it's and it's normal but

14
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,840
a lot of these habits might just be

15
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,960
limited limiting ourselves from doing

16
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,359
the things that we

17
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,239
really really like to do so these are my

18
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
top 10 or not even top 10 but these are

19
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,600
my 10 tips

20
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,680
on successful habits for bounty hunters

21
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,440
so one great thing to do is that if you

22
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
when you wake up in the morning

23
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,280
that's something we all do so it's it's

24
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
an easy thing to add up

25
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,119
instead of thinking that oh man this is

26
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
a crappy day

27
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,639
it's a good way to start the days we've

28
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
been just grateful

29
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,280
to be alive even though it's a pandemic

30
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
going on and you know everything is just

31
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,799
not being

32
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
the way you want it to be it's a very

33
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
easy thing to set an

34
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
intention for the day by just waking up

35
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,919
and saying man

36
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
today feels great it's going to be a

37
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,919
great day no matter what

38
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,280
and one thing that's really important as

39
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,639
well is that

40
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,960
let's say that you want to accomplish

41
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,520
something it's it's a good thing to

42
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,638
define

43
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,840
goals in bhagavantas um

44
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,479
defining a clear goal or defined goal

45
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,758
versus a

46
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,120
vague one would be uh let's i would like

47
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,360
to find a bug today

48
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
that would be a vague one but a more

49
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
defined approach

50
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,280
would be to just simply say i would love

51
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,560
to find

52
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,440
a ssrf bug full ssrf

53
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,680
in a url parameter that will give me the

54
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,639
aws method data back

55
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,759
that's a very defined goal on when you

56
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,600
what you want to achieve

57
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,039
because the key here is to be extremely

58
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,120
specific if you're

59
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,199
tricking your mind into accomplishing

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,759
things it's kind of great to be

61
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,800
very certain about what you want but the

62
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
vagueness of saying

63
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
i would like to find a bug isn't really

64
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,840
going to help you

65
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
on this track and when you're done with

66
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,758
that just get outside

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
i know i know it's a pandemic going on

68
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,360
but mask up

69
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,080
put on a pair of shoes and just go

70
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,280
outside

71
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,960
first thing in morning just get out walk

72
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,400
around for 20 minutes that's

73
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,719
20 minutes of your time where you focus

74
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,758
and put that intention into that thing

75
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,400
that you want to

76
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
accomplish let's get back to the ssr bug

77
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,318
so

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,520
if i'm gonna hunt for a specific kind of

79
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,759
bug that day and i'm

80
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
very very interested in finding that i'm

81
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,680
just gonna

82
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,000
think in and just prepare myself for the

83
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,360
feeling that i have when i find it

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
that excitement that just it fires it

85
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,160
hits my collaborator or my out-of-band

86
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,758
server

87
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,479
and i know it's a it's a full hit

88
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,039
it it's just not a dns hit it's a full

89
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,280
hit it's requesting i can see the header

90
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,560
i can see all the stuff in my request

91
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,758
and i'm like yes

92
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,240
that's it and if i can do that

93
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,479
if i can put that feeling into my body

94
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,160
while i'm doing my 20 minutes walk

95
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,400
that's kind of like forcing

96
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,280
manifestation into itself

97
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,280
because i'm i'm very clear what i want

98
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,758
and i'm getting that physical experience

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,080
on how it feels to achieve that

100
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
so when you get back in again now it's

101
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,960
time to

102
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
let's say let's say you drink coffee i'm

103
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,039
a vivid coffee drinker

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,039
instead of just trying to think of all

105
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,639
the other things that you need to do

106
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,599
prepare your cup of coffee in the most

107
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
present manner that is possible that

108
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,639
means

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,720
if you're grinding your beans or if

110
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,759
you're using an aeropress or a french

111
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
press or something

112
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
that you're spending a total focus on

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
just doing that

114
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,280
the task in hand let's say you're

115
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,680
drinking tea you're boiling the water

116
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,359
you

117
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,879
water you put on the kettle you're

118
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,759
putting your favorite

119
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,560
earl grey kind of i don't know tea style

120
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,560
in there

121
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,000
and you're letting it simmer like let it

122
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,599
sit for a while

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
or if you like if you're into green

124
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,200
juices maybe that's your thing

125
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,399
or if you just want to have bourbon for

126
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
breakfast hey i

127
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,080
i guess choosing a good brand would be a

128
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,919
good idea for you

129
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,919
anyway the whole idea is to be very

130
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,679
mindful of that experience

131
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,199
it takes a very very short time but it's

132
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,079
very good practice

133
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,480
to really focus on just doing one thing

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,640
so

135
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,519
what i would do next is then i that i

136
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,519
used so

137
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
breathe in pull my shoulders up and i

138
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
will

139
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
breathe out and i will relax my

140
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,440
shoulders

141
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,120
to follow the breath out and when that

142
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,120
breath is done

143
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,560
instead of just directly inhaling in

144
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
again

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,079
i'll just i would i would hang on the

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,040
breath so i'll breathe out

147
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,279
that short second maybe two or three

148
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,680
seconds before i inhale again

149
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,000
that's total silence for me that's one

150
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,239
of the rare time my brain just

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,399
relaxes try it out for yourself breathe

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
in

153
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,750
breathe out

154
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,750
[Music]

155
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,560
you breathe in again and just try to

156
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,599
find that focus of silence between the

157
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,599
breaths

158
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,120
hey i just gave you a quick meditation

159
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
enjoy that one

160
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
and you just do that for three minutes

161
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
it's all it takes it's about

162
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
clearing the mind getting out of your

163
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,680
head now when your beverage is done

164
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
find a place where you can sit down for

165
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
a second and take a piece of paper on

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
paper i will prefer

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,640
that you had some kind of calendar

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,080
journal this is the hard part

169
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,880
and this is something that i struggle

170
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,440
with but it's the physical contact

171
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
between

172
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,519
pen paper and your mind because i love

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,800
to write things down on

174
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,920
um in my phone right

175
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,880
but then as soon as i do that it kind of

176
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,959
just disappears

177
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
it's like if i had this certain item

178
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,959
that i like as soon as i put it in the

179
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
drawer

180
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,479
i'm going to forget about it so i need

181
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,160
to have these things lying around so i

182
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,560
can actually see what's going on and

183
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,600
what

184
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,000

189
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,839

201
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
or

202
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,920
if you're doing work for somebody or if

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,720
you're hunting for a bug maybe just

204
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,640
crafting that one liner or crafting

205
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
that extra word list is something that

206
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,240
you put on that list

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,279
and but it's not not more than six

208
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,160
things six

209
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,320
items it's all that can be on the this

210
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,839
list and that's your focus for the day

211
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
and then you just go on with the day and

212
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,120
when your day is over you're back home

213
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,560
again or if you're

214
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,720
you're you're leaving that work from

215
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,160
home state where okay i'm done working

216
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,800
um now it's home time and you prepare

217
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,199
your meal or your dinner or you have a

218
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
you're just relaxing a bit then it's

219
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
time to take that list out again

220
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,479
and you'll look it through it's your six

221
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,320
items right

222
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,440
and you will see okay so i accomplished

223
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,959
that i managed to do that but this

224
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,120
these three things i didn't do

225
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,560
celebrate that success you need three

226
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
things that's amazing

227
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,079
because you don't need to do all of them

228
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,040
because now it's time to

229
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
put three other things on the list it's

230
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
not that it should be any more than six

231
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
six is the important number here so you

232
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
add three more

233
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,959
and you put those on the list too so now

234
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
you maybe have like i need to do laundry

235
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,319
and i need to write that word list and i

236
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,440
need to write that newsletter and that

237
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,079
kind of other stuff

238
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,680
you put those on your list because the

239
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,160
next day when you make wake up in the

240
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,279
morning

241
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,519
you have your tasks set for you and you

242
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
have

243
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,079
already prepared yourself in the process

244
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,319
of preparing for the next day

245
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,599
it's a great way for you to prepare your

246
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,079
mind and just

247
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,279
emptying it and being very focused on

248
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,040
the task at hand

249
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,639
so if it is let's say you were you want

250
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,360
to learn a specific kind of bug

251
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,880
class or you want to practice a specific

252
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,399
kind of hack the box

253
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,920
that's going to be on the list if you

254
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,160
complete that that's all good

255
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,279
if you didn't hey there's it's room for

256
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
another day right

257
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
you can do it then and when you're doing

258
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,279
that when you have that list

259
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,638
a really good thing would be for you to

260
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,320
your know about it and

261
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
yeah this is once again one of those

262
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,600
hard things that i tend to use

263
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,760
procrastinate and not do

264
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
but it gives me so much value when i do

265
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
it so you

266
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,480
write down the things that you

267
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,600
accomplished that day and just you see

268
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
it's like

269
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,120
offloading your mind so you don't need

270
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
to keep everything in your head all the

271
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
time

272
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
and then you will write down three

273
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,720
things that you were very grateful for

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,040
that you achieved it's that simple then

275
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,399
you're rewarding yourself with

276
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,599
oh i'm a good boy i did this amazing

277
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
task that's great

278
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,120
but i'm also being very kind about to

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
towards myself

280
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
for either not completing or maybe

281
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,560
completing tasks

282
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,839
it's a way to a little bit of self-love

283
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,199
for you to

284
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,320
just be nice to yourself and by just

285
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
writing things down

286
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
on paper you're going to offload your

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,480
mind a bit and it's going to relax you

288
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,680
so i would definitely suggest you to do

289
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,440
that and that's it

290
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,719
you're done now it's time for you to

291
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
just relax

292
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
play some video games maybe hang out

293
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,920
with the family or

294
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,519
you know play with legos i don't know

295
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,880
what you do anything that

296
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,560
will reward you for doing the work

297
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,079
you put in the work you're doing all the

298
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
stuff now it's time for you

299
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,920
time because tomorrow is another great

300
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,639
day and you're gonna

301
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,519
blaze through it perfectly and that's

302
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,639
actually it

303
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,440
that's all if you do these if you do

304
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,440
these things

305
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,000
all of them for 21 days you're

306
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
breaking and creating a new habit you're

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
creating a new thing in life

308
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
because i know you brush your teeth

309
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
every day right and

310
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,440
that's something that we're used to and

311
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
as an extra bonus here i'm going to

312
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,240
challenge you

313
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,199
next time you get into the bathroom to

314
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,760
brush your teeth do it on one leg

315
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,519
try to see which one works best for you

316
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,560
start with one

317
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,480
breathe in stand on one leg and just

318
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,000
lift your body upwards like try to

319
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
imagine that you have a little bit

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,680
like somebody's putting your hair up so

321
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,040
you stand there you're longing yourself

322
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,599
while you're brushing your teeth

323
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,000
and try to stay really really focused on

324
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,040
the process of balancing

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,959
once again you're adding a little bit of

326
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,319
practice and meditation into your life

327
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,239
because you're focusing

328
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,639
on doing something else while you're

329
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,720
doing a mundane task like

330
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,320
yeah like brushing your teeth right do

331
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
that for a few days switch over to the

332
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
other leg

333
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,479
and feel the difference it's pretty

334
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:27,839
amazing

335
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:27,839
okay until next time stay curious

336
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
you
