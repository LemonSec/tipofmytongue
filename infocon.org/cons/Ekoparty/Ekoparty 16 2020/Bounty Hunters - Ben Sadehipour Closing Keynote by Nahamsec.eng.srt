00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,759
bug bounty space and i want to drop

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,198
everybody for all the

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,679
ceremony

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
i wanted to share my journey of how i

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,238
have

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
learned to get started in bug bounties

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,919
and all the hurdles i have to overcome

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,520
in order to become comfortable and

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
successful at what i do

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,960
so hi my name is ben sadigapoor most

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,840
people know me as

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
nahamseg on twitter and all other social

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
media platforms

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,480
at the age of 15 i moved to the united

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
states

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
with my mother where she pretty much

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,760
moved me here

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
stayed with me for a few months and

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,839
eventually went back

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,760
home and i had to learn how to do things

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
on my own and kind of be on my

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,358
own as an adult for the next three or

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,518
five years of my

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
teenagers when you move to new country

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
it's a little bit difficult because

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
a it's a country that i have no friends

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,000
in i don't know how to speak the

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
language

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
so i had to learn how to speak english

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,439
make friends

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
and go through the entire teenagers and

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,720
high school years

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
by knowing that in the back of my head

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,119
you know i have an accent i don't speak

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,360
the language

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,400
and things that i have to overcome i use

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,720
that not knowing english i use that as a

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,400
as ammo and weapon for me to become

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,400
better and learn english faster because

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
my entire thing as a teenager was i want

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,280
to get good at computers

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
so when you pick up an international

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
language when the whole world talks in

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,079
and speaks

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
in it becomes easier to understand other

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,798
things because you have the whole

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,158
internet in front of you

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
you can google search for anything you

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,119
want to learn and the answer is going to

56
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,199
be in english

57
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,560
9 out of 10 times so given that i had a

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
lot of times with no friends

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,600
in high school and i was still trying to

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
figure out how to get through it

61
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,960
i use that free time either playing

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
video games because we all need

63
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
somewhere to

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,280
find some piece and have some fun but

65
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,640
also i used it as

66
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
a getaway or somewhere that i could

67
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
dedicate my time and kind of escape

68
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,360
everything that was happening in my life

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,319
with something that i was passionate

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
about

71
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,799
so high school was a little bit

72
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
different for me than most people but

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
eventually i got to college

74
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
where i could do the things that i

75
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,200
wanted to i could pick what classes i go

76
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
to i could pick what time i want to go

77
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,920
to school

78
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,680
and kind of get into being in charge of

79
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,958
my own life and with going to college

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
what comes with that is

81
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,959
you start to get into partying you start

82
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
making friends you start going out

83
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
you're going to get these new

84
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
distractions and you learn about a new

85
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
life that you never knew about

86
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,120
so i had a few years in between where i

87
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
completely

88
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
forgot about computers i got in the

89
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
habit of you know going out and drinking

90
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
and partying with friends

91
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,319
because that was a cool thing to do at

92
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
the age of 19 2021. so again you know

93
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
being in college

94
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
being a lost cause i really didn't know

95
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,000
what i wanted to do i kind of knew that

96
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
i wanted to study computers

97
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,599
but unfortunately the school that i was

98
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
going to didn't really have a strong

99
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,959
computer science background or security

100
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,319
background where

101
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,400
i could learn hacking i could learn

102
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,799
about security and enjoy the things that

103
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,480
i did

104
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,080
as a kid i've always wanted to get into

105
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,840
kayaking but

106
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
when you come from a background of a

107
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,640
conservative family

108
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
traditional family they don't look at

109
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
hacking as a as a

110
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,920
real way of making money and they're

111
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,800
living in 2012

112
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,839
2013 kind of hit rock bottom i had a lot

113
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
of things go wrong

114
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
a lot of it was because i was partying i

115
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
was put on probation

116
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,399
i lost a few family members lost some

117
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
friendships so

118
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,640
this was a very important part of my

119
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,679
life where i had to figure out

120
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,359
either a i let these problems make me

121
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
or i make them into something where i

122
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
could get in charge of my life again

123
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
and kind of put all of that negative

124
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,159
energy into something that i want to do

125
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,720
so back in 2012 2013 through

126
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,319
school i met a friend where they were

127
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,599
part of a government-funded program

128
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,119
where they would recruit

129
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,798
students to either work for the

130
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
government like a state

131
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
a state local state or they were hiring

132
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,359
people to go work for

133
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,958
federal reserve banks also the three

134
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,239
letter agencies that are in the area

135
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
one of the people that was involved in

136
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,519
the program pulled me aside and said hey

137
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,959
i've seen you you know rant about

138
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
hacking and how you want to learn about

139
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
hacking

140
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,959
have you heard of bug bounties this is

141
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,599
where about where yahoo was doing bug

142
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,319
bounties

143
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,839
off their off the platform on their own

144
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,358
and right after they stopped doing

145
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,798
gift cards and they were actually giving

146
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,798
out casualty hackers to find

147
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,840
vulnerabilities in their product

148
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,758
being someone that used yahoo messenger

149
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,599
and all of yahoo products religiously

150
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,440
that was very very exciting because a i

151
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
was really really comfortable with their

152
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
products

153
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,840
and b i would get to hack a company that

154
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
i use as a kid

155
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
and get paid from that so when i found

156
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,520
my first valid vulnerabilities

157
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,039
they emailed me saying hey we would like

158
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,039
to acknowledge you but in order to

159
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
acknowledged for this vulnerability

160
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,800
we need you to go and sign up on this

161
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
website and that website turned out to

162
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
be hacker one

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
so going on hacker one there was the

164
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,440
internet bug bounty for pearl

165
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,440
python and all these different

166
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,360
frameworks and languages but there was

167
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,240
also yahoo who was the only the first

168
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,639
customer that

169
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,639
i believe hacker one had at the time so

170
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,840
from discovering hacker one

171
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,520
i realized that there are other

172
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,679
platforms out there like butt crowd and

173
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,120
synagogue that also do similar things

174
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
and they were all just getting started

175
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,400
in the same space after discovering

176
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,680
hacker one and realizing that these

177
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
companies are

178
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,880
paying for you know hackers to find

179
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,280
vulnerabilities

180
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,080
i came across a blog post written by

181
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
abraham

182
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,000
i think most people know him as zee goo

183
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,159
on twitter should definitely look him up

184
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
he just published a blog post on finding

185
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,639
an rce

186
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,919
on an asian asset of yahoo where it was

187
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,240
a shop where you could

188
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,680
directly inject some php in there and

189
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,440
take control of that box

190
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,520
and execute whatever commands he could

191
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,520
you know reading abraham's blog post

192
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,039
i really really wanted to find a

193
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,159
vulnerability just like him when i get

194
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,320
an rc on yahoo it was no longer about

195
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
the want it was the need that i had to

196
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,520
learn to become better in order to be

197
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
able to find the same vulnerability

198
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,159
throughout that

199
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
journey i tried anything i could i found

200
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
a bunch of exercise i

201
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
found a bunch of other vulnerabilities

202
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,039
but one morning i woke up to yahoo

203
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,719
sending me three different emails

204
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
for three different sql injections that

205
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,400
got me paid nine thousand dollars

206
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
and that's been the most amount of money

207
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,560
that i've ever seen in the past

208
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,639
10 years of my life ever handed to me

209
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,000
for something related to computers

210
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,280
so given that i had 9 000 like any other

211
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
20 something years old

212
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,119
i go straight to a car dealership buy

213
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
the car that i've always looked at

214
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,160
through you know driving by or online

215
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,919
i purchased it came home went into my

216
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,120
room and i told myself

217
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,240
this is it this is how i can make money

218
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,919
if i can wake up

219
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
one day and be nine thousand dollars

220
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,639
richer there's gotta be a way to make

221
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,880
more money

222
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,479
maybe not today but in three years i

223
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,039
could probably do a lot more than just a

224
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,880
vehicle

225
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,318
so how did i get here well there's a

226
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,400
couple of things we can do and i think a

227
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,400
lot of these are still very valuable

228
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
the number one thing is i was on twitter

229
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,159
i was very very active on twitter

230
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,280
whether it was asking questions on

231
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,800
twitter

232
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,559
contacting other hackers for help on

233
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
twitter or just simply following all the

234
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,960
top hackers

235
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,280
and reading all their blog posts and

236
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,680
understanding how the things they did

237
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,679
and also setting up the goal to find the

238
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
same vulnerability as them

239
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,440
just so i can learn how they did it and

240
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,840
be able to say okay i learned this one

241
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,759
thing

242
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,159
let's move on to the next thing so as an

243
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,400
example like i said i want to get rce

244
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
the date image magic dropped their rc

245
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
evolved uh

246
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,720
four or five years ago i wanted to

247
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,000
replicate it i knew i can get it and

248
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,039
within a few days

249
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,800
i was able to find an rc on yahoo where

250
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,360
i was able to exploit a magic image

251
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,319
magic

252
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
trick and get full shell back to my box

253
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,280
that wasn't enough

254
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,280
there's so much more to learn there are

255
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,479
so many other things to learn

256
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,479
and doing all these online vulnerable

257
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,000
apps like dbwa

258
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,840
and anything that was a lab wasn't

259
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,759
enough because in theory those show you

260
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,039
how to understand their vulnerability

261
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,120
but it doesn't mean that you're going to

262
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,199
get better at finding those bugs

263
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
so i spent a lot of my time on vdps i

264
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
think one of the ones that i hacked on

265
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,080
was localized you can go on my hacker

266
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,599
one profile you definitely see me

267
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
sending him some really really crappy

268
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,680
bugs

269
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,758
and i've already disclosed them just to

270
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
show i started somewhere with nothing

271
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,800
and i just use it as a learning

272
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
experience to get better and better

273
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,280
if you're not familiar with vdp's vdp

274
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,039
stands for rule disclosure program

275
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,559
where you submit a vulnerability to a

276
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,800
program or a company

277
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,479
for free and instead they acknowledge

278
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
you and fix that vulnerability

279
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
i'm not saying that's the only way to

280
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,440
learn but at the time

281
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,679
the thing that worked for me was going

282
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,160
after vdp's because it was free real

283
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
estate no other hacker was hacking on it

284
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,440
all the paid hackers all the hackers

285
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,359
that were after money were mostly going

286
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,039
after the big programs like yahoo

287
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,880
i wanted to learn versus they wanted to

288
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
make money so vdps were great i was

289
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,000
learning a ton but

290
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
being in college you always have to

291
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,958
always have to think

292
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
two steps ahead what am i going to do

293
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,760
after i graduate what career am i going

294
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,360
to choose

295
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,200
or what jobs or companies i'm going to

296
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,959
look at so i started applying to a ton

297
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,720
of jobs i applied for

298
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,319
a lot of big tech companies i also have

299
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
bug bounty programs

300
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,519
and every single one of those companies

301
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
ended up rejecting me

302
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,120
i didn't either have the qualifications

303
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
didn't understand website enough

304
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
or i just didn't know how to break into

305
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,239
that sector or whatever you want to call

306
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
it

307
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,600
so i decided to get some books

308
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,719
understand the

309
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,640
now that i understand the attacker

310
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
mentality it was time to understand the

311
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,240
engineering mentality how do they fix

312
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,560
these bugs how do i explain to other

313
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,200
people how to fix a bug that i found

314
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
because

315
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,959
that also becomes a part of doing bug

316
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
hunting so at some point i ended up

317
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,680
coming across a really cool

318
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,839
vulnerability on hulu

319
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,760
on one of their assets i sent them a

320
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,200
report they got back to me

321
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,279
and a year later they opened up a

322
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,360
position for an application security

323
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,120
engineer where i reference to my

324
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,880
vulnerability in my email

325
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
and put it on my resume ended up

326
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,320
applying for the job

327
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
and i was offered a position to work

328
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
with their team because of that

329
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,399
experience that i had with them with

330
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,800
their bug bounty program but eventually

331
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,959
after working at hulu for almost a year

332
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
i realized that engineering wasn't my

333
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,040
thing i didn't like doing engineering

334
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,319
work

335
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,319
i didn't like the defensive side of

336
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,120
things i wanted more and

337
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,920
if you look back at my twitter back in

338
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,519
2015 i was a big critic of hacker wine

339
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120
to a point that i would ask i'm like hey

340
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
change the stuff you have to move things

341
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,920
forward we have to change these things

342
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
and make hackers better or make it

343
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
better for hackers

344
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
so i reached out to gilbert outman

345
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
co-founder of hacker one

346
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,160
and i asked him for a serious meeting

347
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
where i could go into the office i would

348
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
travel to two hours to meet with you

349
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,319
guys

350
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,760
i want to meet in person and i want to

351
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,880
give you real feedback

352
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
and tell you guys some of the things

353
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,040
that i think as an outsider you guys

354
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
could fix

355
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,719
after i went in there i criticized him

356
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,079
and i felt really really bad i felt like

357
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
i just went in there

358
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,560
and just told him everything that was on

359
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,920
my mind without offering a solution

360
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,599
and if you know me and you've seen any

361
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,479
of my content and other things that i've

362
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
done in the world

363
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,959
that is not me so a few days later i

364
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,120
reach back out to yoga and i'm like hey

365
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,719
i'm so sorry for criticizing you guys

366
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
that's not what i was there for

367
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
is there any way i could apply for any

368
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,319
position at hakko one

369
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,599
and help you guys make those changes by

370
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
being a part of the team

371
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
that ends up doing these things so i've

372
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,839
told you my life journey i've talked

373
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,199
about how

374
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,200
you know i moved to another country

375
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
without knowing the language

376
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,279
tried to get into computers i got into

377
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,200
computer security

378
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,120
and eventually when i got a job doing

379
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,560
hacking as a profession

380
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,839
something i didn't mention earlier my

381
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,359
family ended up telling me like hey

382
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,800
hacking isn't a real career you're never

383
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
going to make it anywhere

384
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
you need to stop and go back to

385
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,279
engineering but there's a point to that

386
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,640
so if there's three things you're going

387
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
to take away from this talk i want you

388
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,079
to think about consistency

389
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
networking and community and i'll

390
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,880
explain what i mean get involved get in

391
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
the community

392
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,040
make friends learn from other people

393
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,160
reach out to other folks

394
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
try to understand the things that you

395
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,959
don't understand i'm not saying go and

396
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,560
be pushy

397
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,920
but there's a ton of other people that

398
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,040
have the same goals and the same

399
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,719
interest as you do

400
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,199
so become a part of that community be

401
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
consistent you can't hack one day

402
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,120
put it away for a month and go back to

403
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
it life happens i understand believe me

404
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,399
i've been there

405
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,000
but you have to stay consistent make a

406
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,160
schedule tell yourselves

407
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,519
every week between this time and this

408
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
time on these days

409
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,200
i'm going to dedicate to learning

410
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
hacking whatever that is that you want

411
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
to do

412
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,839
and stay on schedule stick to it and

413
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,319
last but not least

414
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
networking as i mentioned i've submitted

415
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
a ton of books a bunch of different

416
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
companies

417
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,880
and the reason why i got a job something

418
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
i personally believe in is because

419
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,560
i knew somebody at the company who had

420
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,479
previously worked with me professionally

421
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,239
to be able to use the things that i send

422
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
them and believe that i actually have

423
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
these credentials the things that i put

424
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,800
on my resume were real and not things

425
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,360
that i just put on to get past

426
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,719
hr and that person internally was

427
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,240
actually the person that fought to make

428
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,680
sure i got this position

429
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,959
so when you know people at a company

430
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,560
because you have interacted with them

431
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,439
with bug bounties long discussion

432
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,279
programs

433
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
that's definitely a plus put that to

434
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,160
your advantage and i want to close out

435
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,319
this talk with

436
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,439
we don't know what we don't know we

437
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
don't know where this english is going

438
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,720
to go we don't know what we're going to

439
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,399
be in life in three to five years

440
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
but the one thing that i can tell you is

441
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
if you dedicate yourself and you give it

442
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,959
all you have

443
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,320
you're going to look back at this moment

444
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,479
three to five years

445
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
it's all going to be worth it well i

446
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
hope that this talk helps you get

447
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
involved in bug bounties and gives you

448
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,200
the motivation to want to get involved

449
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,839
more with the community and i want to

450
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,839
say thank you so much from the bottom

451
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
you
