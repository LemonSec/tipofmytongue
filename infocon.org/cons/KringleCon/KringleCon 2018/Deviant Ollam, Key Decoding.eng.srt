1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
all right thank you Kringle Khan it is a

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,010
pleasure to be up here is not the

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,410
easiest flight getting up to the North

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,360
Pole but frankly you know I had a lot of

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,580
time to get some good connections and

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,350
Delta Sky Club food and I'm feeling

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,240
pretty okay I'm feeling pretty okay but

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,090
Thank You Santa I see you in the wings I

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,849
did leave room for cookies so without

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,890
further ado I want to make sure everyone

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,019
has a fun time with this it's gonna be

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,019
something that you don't usually think

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,430
about it at sort of CTF events and at

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,960
hacker events where you're focused on

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,690
the keyboard a lot for those who don't

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,640
know me my name is deviant and I am a

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,160
physical security specialist

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,559
I do covert entry work for companies and

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,209
clients who want to get someone into a

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,660
building and through securities like

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,989
doors and locks now what I'm gonna

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,078
present today is a talk about decoding

23
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,449
keys now why would that be useful well I

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,859
mean if you're San over there well you

25
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,379
don't need a key to get in a house right

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,149
you can just zip your way down the

27
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,069
chimney with a twinkle of your nose but

28
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,750
the rest of us want to get through a

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,539
locked door to get inside up in a

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,390
building or get inside of a container

31
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,159
well you need a key now many people

32
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,600
think that if you don't have the key

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,040
lock picking is the only thing you can

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,960
do that's not true let's think about how

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,580
locks actually work on the inside if you

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,679
haven't done any lock picking with me in

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,539
the past or any my friends by all means

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,850
we'll teach you but again this is not a

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,240
lock picking talk this is a key decoding

40
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,189
talk normally inside of a lock you have

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,829
a series of pins those pins are called

42
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,899
tumblers and here we see there's red and

43
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,298
blue pins right well the red pins are

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,100
called the key pins they interact with

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,770
the blade of the key that you would use

46
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,320
and both above those we have those blue

47
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,048
pins those are driver pins when there's

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,908
no key in the lock like now those driver

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,280
pins are blocking and binding they

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,990
prevent the lock from turning if you

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,399
have the right key well that's how you

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,570
get the pin stacks into alignment

53
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,490
letting everything line up now if you

54
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,320
don't have a key yes you could pick the

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,899
lock but wouldn't it be easier just to

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,290
make a key of your own that's what this

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,590
talk is about if you can get near the

58
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,390
actual working Keef or a lock I'm not

59
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,189
talking about stealing the keys that

60
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,500
winds you up on the naughty list I'm

61
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:26,040
just talking about recording the detail

62
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,989
of the key because every key has these

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,750
cuts right there called bidding cuts

64
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:33,329
well those bidding cuts have discrete

65
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,939
values it's not an infinite range of

66
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:39,090
possible depths what we have here are

67
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:42,689
different potential manufacturers

68
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,389
specified cut physicians and every cut

69
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:48,349
on any key is going to be in one of

70
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:50,750
those discreet specific spots

71
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:53,548
manufacturers have charts that exist

72
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,169
locksmiths have ax or s-- back access to

73
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,409
resources that are charts and bidding

74
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:00,269
bidding bidding resources like this well

75
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,000
if you understand that it's a limited

76
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,099
set of data for those cuts to be in

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,859
different positions it's actually

78
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,069
possible to decode a key very quickly

79
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:14,250
and then go produce your own later on a

80
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,349
key machine and that's what we can do if

81
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,959
you can get your hands on a key even

82
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,548
briefly let's say you just have the

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
best-case scenario you have permission

84
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,019
to use a key for a moment but you're

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,579
expected to return it all right you've

86
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,769
got the key in your hands you're gonna

87
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,019
go off to the supply room get something

88
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,629
out of there that somebody is requesting

89
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:35,940
well let's say you have calipers in your

90
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,828
pocket this is the cheapest caliper you

91
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,579
can find on Amazon makes a great

92
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,650
stocking stuffer for you or a friend a

93
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,769
simple set of calipers will allow you to

94
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,799
very rapidly measure the thickness and

95
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:52,680
size of the key blade at each of those

96
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,019
bidding positions and remember if you

97
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,090
know the brand of lock in this case I

98
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,680
can look at this key and I can tell just

99
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,439
by the head of this key that's a

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,989
sergeant brand lock well I know the

101
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,790
brand sergeant has a bidding chart here

102
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,220
it is right here it's all laid out in

103
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,470
thousandths of an inch

104
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,319
well here's our bidding values our cut

105
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,930
depth values let's compare those to the

106
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,789
values we might see with a caliber if we

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,430
have a key here the first key and the

108
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,380
jaw the calipers the first cut is 0.3 oh

109
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,599
eight five does that look like any

110
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,870
possible entry on our bidding chart up

111
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,030
there

112
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,180
sure does that looks like

113
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,400
value of a to cut depth number two on

114
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,290
the sergeant chart all right well let's

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,419
move on to the next position in the

116
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,530
second position we have a thickness from

117
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:42,240
our count bumpers of 0.28 75 well I'm

118
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,830
gonna say that's darn close to two eight

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
eight on the thousandth of an inch scale

120
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,789
so we know that's a three value

121
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,010
we're already chugging along we're

122
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,340
getting the manufacturers bidding code

123
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,889
off this key just by measuring it here's

124
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,260
another three in the next position how

125
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,540
about this position 307 five well again

126
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,700
it's another two now things aren't

127
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,740
always going to be dead-dead perfect

128
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,409
right here we have point two four eight

129
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,990
five well that looks pretty good to me

130
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,970
on okay point two before eight that

131
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,580
looks great too but even if it was off

132
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,370
by a hundredth of an inch or so it's

133
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,620
still going to be valid in the lock to

134
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,690
eight eight five okay and another three

135
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,240
can and there you have it there you have

136
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,910
two three three two five three those are

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,760
cut depths that you could then take to a

138
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,790
locksmith or you could punch in to a

139
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,650
code cutting key machine you know most

140
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,890
people think of copying a key either at

141
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,390
a locksmith or at Home Depot as having

142
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,640
the original key walking in with the

143
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,960
original asking somebody said okay can I

144
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,030
have one of those blanks okay here you

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,250
go and then they churn it out you don't

146
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,099
need the original at a key machine in

147
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,750
many instances if someone has a key

148
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,270
origination machine a code cutting

149
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,900
machine which many locksmiths do you can

150
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,280
just have this code so you know you've

151
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,049
returned the key you were loaned you

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,270
returned it 60 seconds or a minute later

153
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,370
all of a sudden you don't need the

154
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,799
physical key later on now this is

155
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,380
measuring with calipers that's not the

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,960
only thing you can use locksmiths very

157
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,690
frequently in the field will decode keys

158
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,239
using a specific car at a metal card

159
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,740
called a key gauge and if you can't

160
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,440
figure out how this would work it's not

161
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,990
too hard to visualize you slide a

162
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,719
keyblade right through the slot and move

163
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,000
it laterally until it stops somewhere in

164
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,830
this little stair step pattern in this

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
case we have a bidding cut on this

166
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,479
Schlage key that's a 2 2 value the next

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,400
one behind it we can kind of see there

168
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,320
in the shadows it would be a much deeper

169
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,448
value that would be further along down

170
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,550
the key gauge slot

171
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,650
so this is a really rapid and precise

172
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,560
way to operate you know key measurement

173
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,840
tactics what's the trade-off well with a

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,970
key gauge you need to be interacting

175
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,789
with a key that's actually specified on

176
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,040
the gauge it's a limited set of brands

177
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,990
with those calipers though you can

178
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,570
absolutely do it to any brand whatsoever

179
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,389
no matter how obscure in the end though

180
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,460
if you can get those bidding values

181
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:10,830
those cut depth values you can

182
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,130
absolutely produce a key later without

183
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,690
having the key right there in the store

184
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,729
but let's say you can't go hands-on with

185
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,830
the key let's say you need an

186
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:22,289
alternative technique right let's say

187
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,630
the key isn't really being handed to you

188
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,040
it's just in your vicinity maybe it's on

189
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,750
someone's desk and they're kind of

190
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,210
distracted and using a phone

191
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,650
maybe the person doesn't even know that

192
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,729
you're looking at the key because

193
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,679
they're just out at a bar or a

194
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:36,270
restaurant they could just plonk their

195
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,220
keys down and they're not really paying

196
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,979
attention to you you're just a stranger

197
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,820
who sat down next to them if you can

198
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:48,990
take a photograph of a key absolutely

199
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,719
you can decode that key remember every

200
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,820
bidding possible depth value every cut

201
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,830
value on the key should be a standard

202
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,900
interval standard distance from one

203
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,500
another standard distance down from the

204
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,080
top of an uncut blank you can use an

205
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,150
image editor and lay over top of the

206
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,940
image you took you can actually lay

207
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,400
these lines these guidelines overtop and

208
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,849
decode it just by visually looking at

209
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,440
the depths relative to one another

210
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,539
now in a perfect world you would have

211
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,330
some graph paper behind the key really

212
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,250
nice lighting a sharp crisp photo like

213
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,530
this is something you can import into an

214
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,360
image editor like Photoshop or GIMP it

215
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,539
will make adjustment and scale much

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,729
easier for this purpose I keep graph

217
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,830
paper in my wallet a little graph paper

218
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,570
card you can slide under a key I've

219
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,709
taken photos literally in someone's

220
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,560
office where it where they've turned

221
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:42,329
around for all of ten seconds I said hey

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,699
you know I'm here to pick up the

223
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,560
resources from last year's find the

224
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,089
final reports they sold me have the you

225
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,979
have the box somewhere in here right

226
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,170
somebody unlocks a thing puts the keys

227
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,370
down rummages through a closet and while

228
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,990
they're just you know they got their

229
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,760
back turned to me for ten seconds out

230
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,910
the graph paper snap goes my photo and

231
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,740
there there you go if you want to ever

232
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,100
try this with or without graph paper

233
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,500
I've created overlay guidelines for most

234
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,540
common brands of lock I've uploaded all

235
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,640
of these to my github repository where I

236
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,490
keep all my decoding Rapada coding

237
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,140
resources everyone's free to use them

238
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,540
let's take an actual real-world example

239
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,209
and nothing's so beautiful and crisp as

240
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,279
a dead on graph paper photograph let's

241
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,630
take a look at this key this was in a

242
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,390
building where I was invited to give a

243
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,430
talk I'm getting my laptop hooked up and

244
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,500
they had to open up the network closet

245
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,270
to turn on the projection equipment and

246
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,709
so forth and as they did one of the

247
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,000
person you know one of the staff there

248
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,099
just kind of left the key on the desk

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
for a minute making sure my HDMI signal

250
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,750
was working well I took out my phone

251
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,970
snapped a little photo now this is not

252
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,279
great at all right this is at a weird

253
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:51,149
oblique angle if the lighting is not

254
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,520
crisp there's a shadow but we can still

255
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,230
import this image into an image editor

256
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,880
and use if you have any kind of

257
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,100
photoshop skill you can straighten this

258
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,829
out you can get it a little squared off

259
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,020
and true and using my guidelines we can

260
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:07,469
decode this the guidelines i've created

261
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,630
have a series of black edges which you

262
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,670
line up with the edges of the blade of

263
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,060
the key the uncut part of the key and

264
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,099
then all of these intermediary lines

265
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,290
represent even and odd cut depths the

266
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,660
blue lines are evens the gray lines are

267
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,790
odds so knowing that well why would

268
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,189
there be a blue line up here well that's

269
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,990
because the Schlage lock the Schlage

270
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:32,700
brand starts with a zero so knowing that

271
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,500
we've got a possible zero up here right

272
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,810
well it's certainly not a zero let's see

273
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,720
what cut this first position is three

274
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:42,300
four ah that looks pretty lined up it's

275
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,640
a five all right very good depth there

276
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,380
how about this next position it's

277
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,360
clearly a blue line looks like it looks

278
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,320
like an even number well it's not a zero

279
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,660
what is it it's a two over here we've

280
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,760
got a very deep cut I'll let you know

281
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,100
right now the Schlage goes all the way

282
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,110
down to a depth of nine that's this last

283
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,490
gray line well it's not a nine what is

284
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,980
it what's the next odd number it's a

285
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,860
seven and the one next to that it's one

286
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,940
value less it's a six here we have a

287
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,050
seven again looks

288
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,180
like to me what do you think of this

289
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:18,150
last one zero one two there you go that

290
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,500
photo that terrible terrible photo that

291
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,620
I just kind of whipped my phone out and

292
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,840
barely grabbed that's enough to decode

293
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,390
and fully get all the bidding you need

294
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,360
to make a produce a working key for this

295
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,370
room now if you take photos in the field

296
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,950
like this just one more tip from me to

297
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,220
you if you want to make your life just

298
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,740
marginally easier take a second to try

299
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,480
to separate the key from any other keys

300
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,430
that might be there that will help you

301
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,650
out if you can give it a little bit of a

302
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,239
black background that's another thing

303
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,030
you know just get some high contrast

304
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,980
here I'm just using a hat there we are

305
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,880
the brim of my hat is black this key is

306
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,190
separated it out

307
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,780
nice nice stamp on this key what does

308
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,490
that tell us well it's not just any key

309
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,410
it's probably the master key for this

310
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:07,230
entire building and we have gridlines we

311
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,150
have guidelines in this case it's the

312
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,520
sergeant brand and you can decode this

313
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,010
one just the same so yeah all of my

314
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,810
resources for visually decoding keys and

315
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,400
numerically decoding them if you're just

316
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,430
using calipers they're all up on my

317
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:24,090
github page anybody can do this it is

318
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,250
not difficult at all and I really think

319
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,960
that this might just be be very useful

320
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,000
if you ever wind up having a situation

321
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,950
where you need to get into a building or

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,660
out of a building who knows maybe this

323
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,160
will show up in future contests and

324
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,300
events that you might be participating

325
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,640
again

326
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,310
so I really appreciate being here I

327
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,560
enjoy the chance to to be part of this

328
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:46,349
can anyone think they can decode this

329
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,359
before I go notice this is an odd one

330
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,000
right this edge line all of my guides

331
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,839
will list the values in the Sargeant

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,540
brand of lock no cut at all is a 1 value

333
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,460
ah interesting interesting do we have

334
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,680
any ones well no this isn't a cut out

335
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,100
here this is just the uncut edge of the

336
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,469
blade the first cut I would call that a

337
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,540
three down here we have another gray

338
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,240
line it's also odd I'd call that what do

339
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,089
you think guys say it's a five here we

340
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,880
have a three again ah quite the

341
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:21,210
conundrum here was this a badly cut key

342
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,510
is my photograph off what would you do

343
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,699
in the real world

344
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,459
let's skip that position for a second

345
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:29,680
let's see how we look out at the edge

346
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:31,119
this one although a little bit sloppy I

347
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,290
would probably call that a blue line

348
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,060
here I'd call that a six and towards the

349
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,910
tip we have one more blue we have one

350
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,859
more even cut that's a four so we had

351
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:47,410
three five three question mark six four

352
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,420
if you were trying to produce a key in

353
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,969
the real world well if you're not sure

354
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,189
if the this is a four or five go with

355
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,389
the lesser value go ahead and you know

356
00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,070
cut three five three four six four and

357
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,230
if that doesn't work in the lock go

358
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,089
ahead and just hand file it down maybe

359
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,560
even hand file it halfway between if the

360
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,660
lock is that worn out and this key is

361
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,719
working try to hit the mid value if that

362
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,310
doesn't work try the five so in the real

363
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,410
world it's a pretty forgiving process

364
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,268
it's a very accurate process you'll

365
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,910
you'll really be amazed at how much you

366
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,399
can do even with terrible cell phone

367
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,889
kind of speedy on-the-fly covert photos

368
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,829
so whether you decode with a caliper or

369
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,360
a picture producing keys even when

370
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:31,329
you've only been near them for a second

371
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,130
is easy than you might think I hope you

372
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,750
enjoy this material I hope you enjoy the

373
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,689
talk and I hope you enjoy the rest of

374
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,220
cringle con Santa elves mrs. Claus and

375
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,050
everyone else it's really been a

376
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,639
pleasure to be here I hope you'll let me

377
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,139
stick around a few days after the

378
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,670
holidays when we can all actually put

379
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:48,250
our feet up and relax you're not working

380
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,019
so hard but everyone else thank you very

381
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,699
much have a very good time

382
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,699
have very very happy holidays
