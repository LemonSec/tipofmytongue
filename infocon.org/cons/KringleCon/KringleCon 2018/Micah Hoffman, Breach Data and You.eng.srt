1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
hi everybody thanks for inviting me over

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,048
here to Kringle Khan I'm very excited to

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,690
be there this year it's my first year

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,360
and I'm going to be presenting

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,838
information about how attackers use

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,390
breach data to find and compromise your

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,039
accounts on the Internet now the first

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,949
part about this is we're going to talk

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,750
about where we find and breach data what

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,140
it is and then I'll show you how they

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,480
actually activate and use that to do bad

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,360
things but before we do that introduce

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,760
myself I am Michael Hoffman I have been

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,879
teaching for sans for about four years

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,820
now and I primarily teach my own class

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,760
now it's set for 87 the open source

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,070
intelligence class six days of open

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,079
source intelligence gathering in an

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,620
analysis it's actually a quite a fun

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,110
class now I also work for spotlight

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,709
InfoSec as their primary consultants

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,690
doing oceans consulting in the past I've

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,760
done pen testing I've done Incident

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,429
Response and a whole bunch of other

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,259
cyber e type of work as well if you're

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,210
interested catch up with me on twitter

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,290
at the username web reacher now one of

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,548
the first things we need to talk about

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,640
is what is a data breach when a website

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,860
gets compromised or a system gets

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,590
compromised by an attacker with that

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,840
attacker will frequently do is go in and

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,509
take information like usernames

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,790
passwords email addresses and maybe even

35
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,970
more sensitive information like they did

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,970
in the recent Marriott Starwood guest

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,250
system breach there they took everything

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,369
from passport numbers to credit card

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,049
information and more now they take this

40
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,180
information and then many times they'll

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,850
post it on the internet for other people

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,460
to download and sometimes people will

43
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,679
take that information and then do things

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,829
like replay that username and password

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,500
across multiple accounts or multiple

46
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,500
websites to see if you use that same

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,220
username and that same password on other

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,500
sites now we all know that the best

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,650
practice is to use a password manager

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,980
along with using a unique username and

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,920
pass

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,090
for each site but sometimes maybe

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,829
there's accounts out there that you

54
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,599
forgot or maybe you're working with a

55
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,300
customer that doesn't want to do that in

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,540
those cases what we can do is we can get

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,280
smart we can get smart and find out what

58
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,220
information is out there on the internet

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,530
about ourselves or our customers the

60
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,830
best place to do that is a site that was

61
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,860
put together by Troy hunt in Australia

62
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,500
it's called have I been poned have I

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,799
been phoned when a breach happens they

64
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,840
grab the list of user names and email

65
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,360
addresses and passwords that were

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,370
released onto the internet put it into

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,470
this database and allow you to search to

68
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,750
see if there's a user name in there for

69
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,950
instance if I wanted to check if a user

70
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:05,069
named John at example.com I was found in

71
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,298
any breaches I can run a quick check

72
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,429
here and sure enough

73
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:13,349
have I been phone says yes it was found

74
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,030
in 41 breach sites and 27 pastes now if

75
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,959
we scroll down we can find out exactly

76
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,239
what breaches those NAT user John at

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,700
example.com was found in we see the

78
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,319
Adobe bridge and the public combo lists

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,929
Apollo and then the website shows us

80
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,518
information about that breach a little

81
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,590
informational blurb here about what

82
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,840
happened and the different types of data

83
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,340
that was compromised in that breach for

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,190
instance sometimes just emails and

85
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,769
passwords are released but others as you

86
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,380
see here employer geographic location

87
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,380
and more can also be accompanying that

88
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,180
breach so if you were going to do this

89
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,920
about yourself you come up here to the

90
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,200
pet in the field here entering your

91
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,450
information search for that and then you

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,399
know what breaches were out there and if

93
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,440
it says something like the Adobe breach

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,920
whatever username and password you used

95
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,480
for the Adobe login or Doby website you

96
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,089
want to make sure you didn't use that on

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,340
other sites now one of the best things

98
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,269
about how have I been poned is the

99
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,190

100
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,858

102
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,349
robot it'll send you an email and you

103
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,690
confirm that this is your account then

104
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:30,270
every time in the future

105
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,030
have I been poned finds a noob breech

106
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,680
with your data in it it will email you

107
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,690
and say hey just well let you know this

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,120
new breach came out and your data was in

109
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,940
there so that you can hopefully change

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,490
your passwords and take action before an

111
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,630
attacker does now if you're one of those

112
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,510
people that works in a security

113
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,530
operation center or is in charge of the

114
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,870
mail security for some company or domain

115
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,669
you can also use the domain search the

116
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,840
domain search will allow you to look for

117
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:04,080
and get emails for a domains worth of

118
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,299
email so if I run web reach or comm and

119
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,609
I want to see when anybody at web reach

120
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,040
or comms email gets in - have I been

121
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,170
poned I can go ahead and search for that

122
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,050
that information and then have have I

123
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,390
been poned email me or my Security

124
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,040
Operations Center whenever they see that

125
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,810
new email at my domain so those are the

126
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,390
positive things those are the the good

127
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,040
guys protecting our data helping get us

128
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,890
the actionable information that we can

129
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:36,090
use before a bad guy gets in there and

130
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,250
actually starts using it there are

131
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,770
websites out there that can show you

132
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,530
this same type of thing and maybe even

133
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,280
get you more details one of them is

134
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,710
called spy cloud comm now with spike law

135
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,369
comm I've gone ahead and run a search

136
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,380
for the user John at example.com and I

137
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,750
found that he was Fenton that his

138
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,960
details or that e email addresses

139
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,720
t-tests were found in 426 different

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,140
records and it was last exposed one day

141
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,840
ago for the example.com domain for all

142
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,870
users in example.com we have some larger

143
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,460
metrics over here as well so this site

144
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,820
will allow you to see that but it also

145
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,729
allow you to see other information for

146
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,500
instance it might show you the passwords

147
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,800
that you used and other things like that

148
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,690
if you click on this see full earful old

149
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,970
details for free it'll send you an email

150
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,350
to whatever email address you entered

151
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:36,350
into the field so if I type in Jane at

152
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,350
example.com

153
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,689
let's see what happened here we have

154
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:44,869
one personal records were exposed and

155
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,759
the information is here so again this

156
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:49,729
tries to keep a little personal the

157
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,009
information that you are that you might

158
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,359
have out there on the web but there are

159
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:59,029
other places out there where you can

160
00:06:53,359 --> 00:07:01,688
purchase some information and the

161
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:04,429
information that you can buy is more

162
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:07,729
information that is exactly what those

163
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:10,638
attackers will get for instance if there

164
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:13,459
was a breach of Dropbox we could search

165
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,349
for Barack at whitehouse.gov female

166
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,899
address and find that it was in the

167
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:22,248
Dropbox dump or the Adobe dump or the

168
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:24,259
Evan e.com dump and then we click on

169
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,599
that record over here on the right hand

170
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,819
side it will show us the name the email

171
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,709
address and the actual clear text

172
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,809
password that's what's in the yellow box

173
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,969
over there on the right I've blurted out

174
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:36,709
to protect the innocent people that were

175
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,329
that might be using Barak at

176
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:40,549
whitehouse.gov on

177
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:45,079
evany comm in case they haven't change

178
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:47,299
their password so this site D hash comm

179
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,039
will show you the actual password that

180
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:51,919
was in the dump that the attackers might

181
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,449
have but the neat thing about open

182
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,919
source intelligence and about this

183
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,829
website in particular is that we could

184
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,589
actually do do searches on passwords

185
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:04,249
let's think about this now you've got

186
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:06,379
that really really complicated password

187
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,759
that's uppercase lowercase numbers and

188
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,739
letters and took you a long time to

189
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,929
figure it out and to remember it but

190
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,448
you'll remember it and maybe you use

191
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:16,399
that across multiple websites because

192
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,309
well it's a very strong password right

193
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,319
nobody's gonna be able to crack that

194
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:24,409
what happens sometimes is that on a

195
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,559
website that password will get changed

196
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:30,049
into something called a hash a hash is a

197
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:32,300
unique value cryptographically changing

198
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:36,889
that string of whatever your strong

199
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:39,948
password is into a hash that hash will

200
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:42,829
then be stored in the database now what

201
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:46,160
you can do in d hashed is the same type

202
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:47,959
of Cuong or question to it hey instead

203
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,969
of looking for barack at White House

204
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,670
actually what we do is we do search for

205
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,420
email Barak at whitehouse.gov and then

206
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,000
when we click on

207
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,410
a record like in Dropbox here on the

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,149
right hand side instead it's just seeing

209
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,550
the word password we now see hashed

210
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,470
password and inside of that yellow box

211
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,240
on the right hand side of the screen you

212
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,930
would normally see the actual password

213
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,910
hash I've again blurted it out the neat

214
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,910
thing that we can do is take that hash

215
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,949
of that really complicated kind of

216
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,949
unique password that you have and then

217
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:22,160
search for that when we search for that

218
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:25,250
inde hashed we find other accounts that

219
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,829
have that same password now let's think

220
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,019
about that if you use a really strong

221
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:32,180
secure password and it's something that

222
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,010
very few other people use but you use

223
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,529
that password across multiple accounts

224
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,839
then over here when we search for that

225
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:41,480
hashed password here or even a really

226
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,079
strong password we can maybe find other

227
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,279
accounts of yours that are not related

228
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,199
that use that same password and that

229
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,730
might show us other accounts that are

230
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:52,819
out there that are yours for instance

231
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,800
Baraka whitehouse.gov in Dropbox might

232
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,579
be the actual same person that set up

233
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:02,089
the mr.president dot the hero at gmail

234
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:04,910
comm gmail account so you can see that

235
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:08,300
that one's also in Dropbox in fact all

236
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,100
four of these are on Dropbox so somebody

237
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,459
might have used the exact same password

238
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:16,820
in four different accounts on Dropbox

239
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:21,500
and we found them by pivoting onto this

240
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:23,870
password hash so the lesson learned here

241
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,320
is one find out what information is out

242
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,199
there

243
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,029
two if you use the same password on

244
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,800
multiple accounts people could be using

245
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,189
this techniques like against you and

246
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,420
three you should monitor your

247
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,610
information that's out there and make

248
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,390
sure that you're alerted when new stuff

249
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,190
comes through I hope you've enjoyed my

250
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,620
brief conversation here about how

251
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,990
attackers are using Osen to target you

252
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,079
and your organization's if you want come

253
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,410

255
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,750
here are some URLs to those sites that I

256
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,319
went to including an extra one there to

257
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,640
set up alerts on the pastebin site

258
