1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:08,280
BRR it's cold in here

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,370
Wow thank Santa for the invitation I

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,059
wasn't expecting the Coast Guard escort

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,619
for my sail up here to the North Pole

5
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:21,359
boy it's beautiful and whoa wait

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,710
it's Kringle khan time well thank you

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,380
for the invitation

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,039
welcome to pcap for fun and profit I

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,269
hope to spread a few minutes of joy into

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,300
your life but talking about packet

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,190
capture analysis and crafting techniques

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:38,550
that you can use on your next pen test

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,468
on your next investigation or just what

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,059
you're sitting at home enjoying Kringle

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,100
Khan so starting off with packet capture

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,589
so some of the common tools as I'm sure

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,960
you're aware of our pcap tools these are

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,329
tools that are built on the library for

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,879
packet capture a venerable library

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,170
that's been around since the dawn of the

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,349
epic and these are tools like TCP dump

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,510
for example Wireshark and tea shark bro

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,039
along with some other tools like daemon

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,900
logger which is a great software tap

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,560
we'll talk about that in a few and

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,450
kismet for capturing all your Wireless

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,580
goodness there is quite a bit of

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,119
wireless here on the North Pole I might

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,820
add there also a non peak app related

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,900
sniffers uh like you can capture packets

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,079
directly on windows with an SH trace

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,189
there's Solaris noop for example and

33
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,809
there's also a number of other tools

34
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,779
that can be useful for packet capture

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,700
for the pen testers especially d sniff

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,350
adder cap your senior and we'll talk

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,979
about each one of these kind of with

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,169
pros and cons so it would TCP dump TCP

39
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,720
dump it is is a wonderful tool it's been

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,360
around again since the beginning of time

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,210
and as I mentioned in the beginning that

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,250
these tools are our peak app related

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,729
tools they're all using the same library

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,329
and thusly they save the packets in the

45
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,450
same format in a pcap format this is a

46
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,128
huge advantage because if I capture the

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,920
packets for example on a compromised

48
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,470
machine using TCP dump saves them as

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,269
pcap bring them back across to me I

50
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,720
can open them up in Wireshark or I can

51
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,420
open them up in other analysis tools for

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,210
example that understand the pcap format

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,859
so I can open them up in Breaux or I can

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,630
open them up and snort I can open up

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,050
I'll open them up in a variety of

56
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,299
different tools so a TCP dump is a

57
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,590
wonderful tool it's a relatively small

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,720
package so it's useful if yeah and the

59
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,180
other reason why it's really useful is

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,090
that it's often installed as a standard

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,850
package in many distributions of Linux

62
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:52,440
and many flavors of UNIX and BSD

63
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,709
Wireshark and tea shark another set of

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,930
tools there are two components of the

65
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,310
Wireshark package Wireshark the

66
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,070
traditional tool is a graphic user

67
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,760
interface tool works on Windows works on

68
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,350
Linux and other distributions a

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,780
fantastic tool a great tool for packet

70
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,230
capture although not my favorite choice

71
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,020
for capturing packets on a compromised

72
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,540
machine on a client's network for

73
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,760
example for many reasons the number one

74
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,150
reason though for me is that it requires

75
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,209
lots of libraries and additional code to

76
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,769
be installed on that box so if I don't

77
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,800
have to install anything on the machine

78
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,150
all the better tea shark which is also

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,510
part of the Wireshark package is a

80
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,300
text-based console based version of

81
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,829
Wireshark this can be very useful in

82
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,480
that it brings a lot of the power that

83
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,150
Wireshark brings to the table from

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:51,149
analysis to a packet capture and packet

85
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,769
logging as well as using regular

86
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,560
expressions and other things to search

87
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,330
for thing data in packets but it also

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,280
brings you to the command line interface

89
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,580
so you can actually pipe it to other

90
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,709
tools as well as use some additional

91
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,810
features that are in T shark which are

92
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,299
really helpful like being able to

93
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,090
actually format what columns get

94
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,489
displayed in the tshirt output so for

95
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,590
example if you're sniffing and you want

96
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,548
to pull out radius authentication tokens

97
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,060
from packets

98
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,159
well Wireshark understands radius about

99
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,280
packets and can dissect them and it has

100
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,330
keywords to be able to single out and

101
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,698
display for

102
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,969
example of the authentication tokens

103
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:37,580
going across the wire so I really useful

104
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:41,909
things there bro has a new name the the

105
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:45,210
but it's it's a wonderful interface it's

106
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:47,669
a wonderful tool to be able to go

107
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,698
through capture packets index log

108
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:52,680
packets it's really useful for example

109
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,479
when you're on a pen test or when you're

110
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,930
on an instant response if you want to

111
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,199
look for specific lookups specific DNS

112
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:04,169
requests for example maybe you've set up

113
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:08,069
your phishing campaign to use a specific

114
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:09,840
domain and you want to see those

115
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,699
requests going across the wire you

116
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,580
happen to have an interface that you're

117
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,770
sniffing and piping it to bro for

118
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,409
example you could use a bros

119
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,389
notification system to let you know when

120
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:24,750
that happens really really cool really

121
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:27,539
useful a daemon logger was a written by

122
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:32,000
Marty rush the author of snort it is a

123
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:36,599
software tap a very very well written

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,150
small package very very good code highly

125
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:41,099
recommend this as a great way to sniff

126
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,948
packets off the wire save them to disk

127
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:47,250
and kismet a venerable open-source

128
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,460
project for sniffing and analyzing

129
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,659
wireless packets very very cool stuff

130
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:57,060
net SH the Windows nutshell it allows

131
00:05:54,659 --> 00:06:00,449
you to do traffic traces it does not

132
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,000
save them to pcap format but the net sh

133
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:07,199
trace format can be converted to pcap

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,779
with additional tools or code snoop is

135
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,759
on Solaris and then act active capture

136
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,279
sniffers that I'm sure most of you are

137
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,370
very well aware of D sniff and editor

138
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,740
camp these are tools that in addition to

139
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,409
capturing packets and manipulating them

140
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,180
they can also manipulate the

141
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:27,089
infrastructure that they're connected to

142
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,779
they can ARP cache poison switches they

143
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:32,969
can cause denial service on km tables

144
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:36,300
and much of other things to enable you

145
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:39,029
to capture traffic and/or sessions your

146
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,490
sinem is a little bit more obscure it's

147
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:43,440
been out for quite a while too great

148
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,200
mainly because I think a little more

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,230
obscure because it's a layer tool to

150
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,360
tool there's a line to capture and

151
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,960
manipulate packets at layer two so you

152
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,670
can capture the packets but you can also

153
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,620
go through and edit the packets and then

154
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:02,250
resend them riesling them on the wires

155
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,950
pretty cool stuff there for packet

156
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,990
analysis kind of the the go-to for the

157
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,659
industry I would say is is Wireshark and

158
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,210
it's free open-source in it supports in

159
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,970
a huge suite of protocols over 500

160
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,489
protocol dissectors included with the

161
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,710
free version of Wireshark and there are

162
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,090
other dissectors that are available to

163
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,960
specific industries whether you work in

164
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:27,140
ICS and other industries that have

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,030
specific protocols that are proprietary

166
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,560
there are some protocol dissectors for

167
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:36,150
those as well it supports and converts

168
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,940
speaks all sorts of packet capture

169
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:42,330
formats so for example if you have

170
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,219
something that was you know captured

171
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,830
with a an intrusion prevention system

172
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,720
and saved to their own proprietary

173
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,510
capture format chances are Wireshark can

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,260
read it and convert it back to pcap and

175
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,479
vice versa

176
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,520
pretty cool stuff there it also has a

177
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,190
lot of visualization tools built into it

178
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,400
you can visualize sessions in

179
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,650
conversations you can pull out a lot of

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,900
attachments and other objects and files

181
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,080
that get transferred it's pretty cool

182
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,000
stuff there although a couple bullets

183
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,150
down network miner does I think a better

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,910
job at the extraction or identification

185
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,549
and extraction of objects so if I was

186
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,190
going for a more of an investigation

187
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,260
role a network miner might be a better

188
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,360
tool than Wireshark to go pull some of

189
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,588
that stuff out very very cool stuff

190
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,500
there bro now the new name but again

191
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:41,339
great network collection in my mining

192
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,260
tool and I say you say that the

193
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:47,100
interface is well made for for the right

194
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:50,520
brain the idea here is that it really is

195
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,310
a mining tool right for the left brain I

196
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,449
should say it's a great tool to go

197
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,140
through in

198
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:00,900
amount of data and just start extracting

199
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,580
data looking for patterns looking for

200
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,819
indicators of compromise and other

201
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,850
things within a you know the network for

202
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,820
example so for visualization tools we

203
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,650
have multi go and Splunk have plugins

204
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,380
that allow you to bring in packets and

205
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:20,010
visualize them plotting tools everything

206
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,460
from new plots for example to the our

207
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,230
utilities to to many others where you

208
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,600
can bring in and visualize either

209
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,840
components with packets or traffic to

210
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,400
visualizing you know the entire network

211
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,260
traffic trace and then packet crafting

212
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,420
we have a two basic categories here

213
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,450
packets slinging and packet crafting so

214
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,610
back at slinging for me is more tools

215
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,820
that will craft packets on your behalf

216
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,890
and send them out so nmap is a classic

217
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,170
example of this we all know it as a

218
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,090
network exploration tool and a network

219
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,180
mapper for example but you can actually

220
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,730
specify the the flags for TCP packets

221
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,640
you can specify you know the specific

222
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,410
size for UDP packets and/or payloads so

223
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,130
it does craft packets on your behalf it

224
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:11,240
also sniffs packet it's on the return

225
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:13,740
net cat and socket and all the other

226
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,200
derivatives of netcat for example a

227
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,080
great tool for sending packets

228
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,970
redirecting packets proxying packets and

229
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:26,730
and so forth Nessus also will craft

230
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,790
packets on your behalf frag router is a

231
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,580
proxy tool that will fragment all your

232
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,120
packets to evade intrusion detection and

233
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,920
Prevention systems F tester is a suite

234
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,290
of it's a pearl tool but it will read

235
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,870
for example firewall rules or snort

236
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:50,219
rules and it'll create packets designed

237
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:53,640
to test those specific rules then for

238
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,470
packet crafting itself escaping escapee

239
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,830
is kind of the king of a packet crafting

240
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,700
in many ways escapee can used on pen

241
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,470
tests and uh and also on the

242
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,800
investigation side in so many different

243
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,730
ways for example you know we recently

244
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,240
adding Guardians

245
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:16,740
doing a red team we compromised an

246
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,980
embedded MIPS system and you know we

247
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,830
didn't have the ability to install and

248
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,990
map and other tools but it did have

249
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:29,310
Python installed and we we could

250
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,500
actually get escapee Doron and so we use

251
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,800
that to craft packets and map the

252
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,960
network from that embedded system you

253
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,540
know which was definitely very cool same

254
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,330
thing happened recently on a pen test

255
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,890
where we were hacking a kubernetes

256
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,700
cluster that did not have direct access

257
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:50,699
to the Internet so once we were there we

258
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,630
did have access to Python though so so

259
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,010
away we went

260
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,430
so the ability to be able to craft

261
00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:00,810
packets craft packets on the fly capture

262
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:02,099
packets analyze them and even repurpose

263
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,189
them and send them back out on the wire

264
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,839
whisk ap is very very useful one other

265
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,970
great reason from a pen test perspective

266
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:15,330
to learn how to use escapee is ipv6

267
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,839
escapee has great ipv6 support and not

268
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,130
many of your security tools do and a lot

269
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,490
of organizations once you're on the

270
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,920
inside ipv6 is wide open so another

271
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,190
great reason to explore some packet

272
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,469
crafting fun then we have HP a very

273
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,589
simple tool and you're seeing I already

274
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:39,240
mentioned briefly a layer to capture and

275
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:41,220
edit and crafting tool a great tool I

276
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,890
believe was written by Duffy but also uh

277
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,100
back in the day your seniors named after

278
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,980
the latin name for the bubonic plague so

279
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,860
I guess it has good intentions but but

280
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,230
it's a great tool a kind of a clunky

281
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,380
curses interface but really really

282
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,490
powerful and highly recommended it's

283
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,750
powerful because not only it does it do

284
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,720
what it doesn't layer two very very well

285
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,990
but it also it's relatively easy to

286
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,330
install on end target systems so all

287
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:18,000
those things make it a good tool for

288
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:20,160
that so this brings us to the fin so

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,060
thank you for joining us here at Google

290
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,030
comm thanks to Santa for the

291
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,270
amazing invite and that Coast Guard

292
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,740
escort you know a little heads-up on the

293
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,900
temperature would have been nice but I

294
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,390
guess I should have known but being from

295
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,920
Brazil that's what happens well happy

296
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,710
holiday to you and yours I hope you

297
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,729
enjoy your time here at Kringle cone and

298
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:45,360
we'll catch you later at some other time

299
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,360
Mike yeah
