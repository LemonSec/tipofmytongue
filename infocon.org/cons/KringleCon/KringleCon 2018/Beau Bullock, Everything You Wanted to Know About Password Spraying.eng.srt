1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
welcome everyone to Kringle Con I'm

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,259
super happy to be here at Santa's castle

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,030
this is probably the coldest place I've

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,940
ever been and for Florida and it's uh

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,268
you know even worse I mean we I had to

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,770
travel insane distance to get here and

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,330
the entire trip was just like

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,698
treacherous like I had to like get on a

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,560
biking ship at one point and it's just

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,630
it's madness but anyway I'm happy to be

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,430
here it took forever to get here but

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,500
this is amazing I can't believe we're

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,948
having a hacker conference at the North

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,170
Pole so welcome everyone I am your

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,480
speaker in this room my name is Bobo

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,040
look and today I'm gonna talk to you

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,199
about everything you've ever wanted to

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,339
know about password spraying but we're

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,010
afraid to ask

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,340
so we'll get into what exactly password

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,050
spring isn't just a moment but first off

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,879
let's talk a little bit about like what

23
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,459
our credentials anyway like what I mean

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,980
if you're coming into this if you're

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,020
coming into this conference you probably

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,339
had to have credentials to even get in

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,960
here you probably had to have some sort

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,189
of password to even get into this place

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,460
so credentials are vital they control

30
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:11,429
access to your account whenever you go

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,439
to website you typically have to sign in

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,290
and use a username and password and

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,298
attackers will want that password and

34
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,159
when we talk about hacking an

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,229
organization or hacking a company or

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,900
hacking Christmas for that matter

37
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,150
we can look at the ability to gain

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,930
access to credentials as being the first

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:34,079
kind of step into completely taking over

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,790
that organization or company or whatever

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,729
whatever we're trying to get access to

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,750
now a lot of people will think okay well

43
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,420
I'm just this employee of this company

44
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,530
maybe I'm like you know nobody I'm you

45
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,119
know I'm in accounting who would want my

46
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,810
credential what does it matter

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,290
well you know whenever we are attacking

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,479
a company that utilizes Active Directory

49
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,820
which is very often I would I would put

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,908
it in like the 95 percent of companies

51
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,070
that I assess from Black Hills

52
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,840
Information Security from from companies

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,539
that we perform penetrations again for

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,569
penetration tests against use Active

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,950
Directory which is a Microsoft service

56
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:18,329
which basically is a directory of

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:21,988
of usernames and computers and it helps

58
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,760
to kind of combine everything that you

59
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,620
want to control with an organization

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,780
from a computer standpoint it allows you

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,450
to push out policies to specific users

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,209
that kind of thing well having an act

63
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,488
having access to a single credential of

64
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,069
an Active Directory account typically

65
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,310
gives you a lot more than just access to

66
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,500
that users computer system or to their

67
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,950
specific account Active Directory is is

68
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,360
vast so you know a lot of times we'll

69
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,010
get access to a credential and we can

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,830
access things like file shares on the

71
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,569
network things that a normal user can

72
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,160
access that you know their their

73
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,290
credential gives them access to in the

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,660
network if for example they use

75
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,069
something like like office 365 a lot of

76
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,989
a lot of companies we assess these days

77
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:07,819
are moving to the cloud and using things

78
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:10,200
like office 365 we're now sharepoint and

79
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,929
various documents an Outlook all that

80
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,369
stuff is in the cloud and if I have

81
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,890
access to a credential I can now not

82
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,320
only access that users let's say their

83
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,358
email but I can also access SharePoint

84
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,489
where and a lot of times SharePoint is

85
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,500
where companies store a vast amount of

86
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,890
information regarding their company

87
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,200
things like maybe VPN details internal

88
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,630
documents that kind of thing I was

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,048
actually just on an assessment last week

90
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,799
where an internal git repository which

91
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,140
is a typically like a source code

92
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,239
repository of information and internal

93
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,768
to this network anyone met a credential

94
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,209
on the domain anyone who had an Active

95
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,440
Directory credential can access it and

96
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,019
there was a lot of very sensitive

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,200
information in that including access

98
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,690
keys to their Amazon AWS account

99
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,149
passwords to a number of different

100
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,130
services and so on so the point trying

101
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,560
to get to here is that having a single

102
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,690
credential will allow access to a number

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
of other things and be the next step in

104
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,430
the attack

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,650
so typically within a Microsoft Active

106
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,919
Directory network your default password

107
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,239
policy is is a minimum of 8 characters

108
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,380
and doesn't include your username so

109
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,599
you're not allowed to set it to your

110
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,840
username and the majority of the time

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
it's set to what they call password

112
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,810
complexity which is three of the four

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,429
categories uppercase

114
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,090
sledders lowercase letters numbers or

115
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,650
non numeric symbols and by default these

116
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,138
accounts typically lock out after about

117
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,510
five attempts within a 30 minute window

118
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,620
so a 30-minute observation window so

119
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,800
what's the password that fits that

120
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,470
policy well fall 2018 and we'll what

121
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,470
kind of get into more more more details

122
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:53,130
about why that's very key here in a

123
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,290
minute so what are some common password

124
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,320
attacks when we when we look at hacking

125
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,340
an account brute-forcing obviously is

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,650
one of the first things that comes to

127
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,299
mind for most most hackers out there and

128
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,099
what that is is essentially trying

129
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,350
thousands of passwords against one

130
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,419
account so this is kind of problematic

131
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,830
when we look at that lockout policy that

132
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,690
we mentioned previously because if we

133
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,200
try 2,000 of passwords against one

134
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,810
account

135
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,830
you're gonna lock them out really quick

136
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,330
another common password attack is

137
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:24,330
password reuse so if you for example

138
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,919
were part of a breach or part of a if

139
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,909
you had your account on a site or

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,349
service that was breached your password

141
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,289
your clear text password might be out

142
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,410
there for the world get their services

143
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,789
such as have I been poned that allow you

144
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,990
to kind of search for your email address

145
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,729
and see if you have been part of a

146
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,580
breach but a lot of times those those

147
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:47,969
breach credentials are just publicly

148
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,370
available on on various websites and you

149
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,930
know for an attacker they can go grab

150
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,890
those in the Charter we use them and if

151
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,080
you're using the same password for

152
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,289
example like your LinkedIn account as

153
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,460
you are on your corporate Active

154
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,560
Directory account we might be able to

155
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,138
just reuse that password credential

156
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,539
phishing is another huge topic all of

157
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,830
its own this involves social engineering

158
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,210
a target into in putting their creds

159
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,010
into a portal that an attacker controls

160
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,979
so I would basically send you a link to

161
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,080
let's say I wanted to fish your Gmail

162
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,539
credential am i it set up a portal that

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,070
looks almost identical to Gmail and then

164
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,840
send you a link telling you that you

165
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,729
need to log in to this this is a very

166
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,989
basic example but a lot of people get

167
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,490
tricked into and putting their

168
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,470
credential and credentials into these

169
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,400
types of sites and then password

170
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,530
spraying and that's what this talk is

171
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,888
all about so we're gonna get more into

172
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,619
the details of that now so take this

173
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,450
picture for example of a ton of locks

174
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,700
just you know locked against a wall

175
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,409
offense so

176
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,820
you know locks are not the perfect

177
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,410
example but this can kind of paint a

178
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,480
picture here so imagine this is an

179
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,340
Active Directory environment where each

180
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,770
one of these locks kind of symbolizes an

181
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,659
account for a user that would log into

182
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,370
their network now you know log

183
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,520
manufacturers a lot of times actually

184
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,650
have common keys or key to like locks

185
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,900
that you know if you have one key you

186
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,630
might you would open multiple locks so

187
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,250
for example here let's say that these

188
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,780
users are the people that put these

189
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,840
locks here could actually choose their

190
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,840
own keys such as the case with passwords

191
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,940
now if I chose a key that was relatively

192
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,250
easy or something common I might be able

193
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,660
to unlock a lot of these locks so this

194
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,630
is kind of similar to what password

195
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,910
spring is so with the lock out policies

196
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,020
preventing us from brute-forcing we have

197
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,030
to think of another way to kind of get

198
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,830
around that restriction and somehow get

199
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,140
access to an account now what if we

200
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,419
tried authenticating using only one

201
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,190
password but against all of those

202
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,710
accounts so let's say we grabbed one key

203
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,660
and we tried one key against all of

204
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,669
those locks we might actually get lucky

205
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,590
and find that one of those locks just

206
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,560
magically opens because it's a common

207
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,200
key so what's gonna happen is we're

208
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,060
gonna generate thousands of fail logins

209
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,070
but they're all single failed logins for

210
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,780
each user so that doesn't actually meet

211
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,030
the lockout threshold for a specific

212
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,280
user so for example if a lockout

213
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,710
threshold is set to 5 attempts in 30

214
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,770
minutes and we only try one attempt per

215
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,419
user we can you know try thousands of

216
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,070
failed logins because we're trying to

217
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,900
log into everyone else's account we're

218
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,000
not trying to log into that one specific

219
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,450
account using multiple passwords which

220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,250
are having one password and we might get

221
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,870
lucky with something common like season

222
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,930
year or company one two three or

223
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,510
password year so season year is is

224
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,790
perfect in most cases and it's honestly

225
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,770
the most common thing that we find in

226
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,039
most organizations because it lines up

227
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:38,760
to the default policy for resetting your

228
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,829
password which is 90 days so you know we

229
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,569
find that people are like oh I need to

230
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,500
reset my password let's just try winter

231
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,500
2018

232
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,600
or fall 2018 you know and and then

233
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,730
repeat after 90 days change it to season

234
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,140
year a lot of people do that and then

235
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,060
when we get access to an account we now

236
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,170
have the ability to do those other

237
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,540
things that I mention early like

238
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,670
access to SharePoint and stuff so what

239
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,399
are some ways we can do this so internal

240
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,469
to a domain if you have access to a

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,209
system with an Active Directory account

242
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,800
you can use one of the tools that I

243
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,869
wrote called domain password spray which

244
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,579
is a PowerShell script that essentially

245
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,040
just performs password spraying against

246
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:16,920
all the users within a domain another

247
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,490
way to perform password spraying is with

248
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,949
Metasploit SMB login module and so both

249
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:27,089
of these will essentially create failed

250
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:28,829
logins on the target system and i i've

251
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,540
had a number of customers lately who

252
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:32,638
have started to really detect this type

253
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,779
of activity so we started kind of

254
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,709
thinking like what are some ways you can

255
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:40,560
kind of evade using this specific

256
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:44,430
internal domain spray well what if we

257
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,779
hit Outlook Web Access so this is a very

258
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,660
common service as well and a lot of

259
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:51,990
organizations so Microsoft Exchange and

260
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,189
an Outlook Web Access are very common

261
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,199
across a lot of the organizations we

262
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,029
assess one of the tools that I wrote

263
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,859
called mail sniper has the ability to

264
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,689
perform password spraying ants oo and

265
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,760
the failed logins look a little bit

266
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,800
differently than they do against SMB I

267
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,199
was just on another assessment recently

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,209
where I used this this tool and it did

269
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:12,719
not get detected whereas the previous

270
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:15,268
tool that I showed you did so when we

271
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,880
when we look at trying to evade logging

272
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,440
this might be another option but we've

273
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,640
also had a lot of customers who have

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,769
seen this specific tool when they

275
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,420
started alerting on it as well so what

276
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,970
else can we try against well how about

277
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,839
RDP so remote desktop protocol which is

278
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,640
on by default on most Windows systems so

279
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,260
I tested out using this tool called X

280
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,829
free RDP which is actually a Linux tool

281
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,060
against a Windows server and I was just

282
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:41,010
kinda going through the process of

283
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,050
trying to figure out if this would maybe

284
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,060
evade some logging and to my surprise

285
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,349
the the failed login event didn't

286
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,890
actually include the source IP address

287
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:52,920
the host name was there but the IP

288
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,019
wasn't which was very odd so why was

289
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,930
there no idea in the log well it turns

290
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,610
out that RDP within LA which is called

291
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,349
Network clear authentication doesn't

292
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,079
actually log the source IP to a security

293
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,449
log in LA actually pre authenticates the

294
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,920
user so like whenever you you already P

295
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:12,219
to a system you might be

296
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,199
my comment commonly recognized the the

297
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,269
prompt that kind of comes up that looks

298
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,240
like a traditional like windows prompt

299
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:22,410
prior to actually getting to the GUI of

300
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,519
Windows that is actually in LA at work

301
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,649
so there's actually supposed to be

302
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,320
another log that in a lei supposed to

303
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,260
write to and this in this event right so

304
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,760
in the event that I fail login using RDP

305
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,420
that has in LA there should be this

306
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,120
event 1:40 filled filled filled log an

307
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,170
event that actually gets logged too

308
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,750
whenever somebody fails but what is

309
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,449
really really misleading about this is

310
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,720
that it only fires when the username is

311
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:55,240
invalid so if I'm using valid user names

312
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,079
with invalid passwords there is no event

313
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,699
ID 140 log and I've got a quick demo

314
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:04,149
with this to kind of show you how this

315
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:06,219
looks so to show you here I've got an

316
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:10,510
attacker system with an IP address of

317
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,070
192 168 88.2 4 5 and I'm going to

318
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,089
demonstrate using this tool called our

319
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,680
desktop against a Windows Server 2012

320
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,110
where we're gonna attempt to log into

321
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,290
this deviator account and we can see

322
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,810
that we've failed to login now if we go

323
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:29,500
to look at the actual failed event log

324
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,969
now we will see the username so we

325
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,699
should CD Vader as the account name

326
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,370
there and then we also see that we have

327
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:37,870
the you know under an unnamed unknown

328
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,940
username or bad password and then also

329
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,800
the workstation name and the source

330
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,410
network address so that's our attacker

331
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,510
IP so total attribution there we know

332
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,880
exactly who performed a failed login

333
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,439
using that tool and the reason that

334
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,910
happened is because our desktop does not

335
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,680
use NLA to authenticate so to kind of

336
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,930
show you a perfect concept here I

337
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,910
created a list of host names so we see

338
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,920
like printer one share one sheriff I

339
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,390
don't look here so these are the list of

340
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,760
host names we'll be sending to this

341
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:11,139
system and then we also have a list of

342
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,149
usernames here and I have a proof of

343
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:14,680
concept Python script which I'll show

344
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,449
you a link to that a little bit that

345
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,920
basically takes that host list and the

346
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,870
user list and then performs a password

347
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,910
spraying it's our DP and we can see that

348
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,700
the crud was probably valid so this

349
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,069
means that the actual

350
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,070
users credential fn-2187 was actually

351
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,420
spring 2017 that credential is valid by

352
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,560
the user because they're not anise

353
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,300
trader of this system or they're not in

354
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,790
the RDP group they're not actually able

355
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,140
to RDP to the system but now let's go

356
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,290
look at the audit failures for these

357
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,730
users so again we'll see the username so

358
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,640
we'll see that a field event happened

359
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:47,630
but if we go look at the workstation him

360
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:49,030
share five and no source IP that's not

361
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,430
good for trying to track down who

362
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:54,230
performed this failed login so imagine

363
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,550
now you know you're you're an

364
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,050
administrator on this network and you're

365
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,400
just seeing these failed logins come

366
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,290
from hosts that are already on your

367
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,959
network you know I could give it a list

368
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,280
of your own host names you know I could

369
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I can make it look like people are just

370
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,120
failing to log in from everywhere and

371
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:12,320
with no source IP it gets really

372
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,560
difficult so again like with with in LA

373
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,450
it should log to this other log but you

374
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,449
know we mentioned before that if we're

375
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:26,390
using valid user names then it doesn't

376
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:29,990
actually show up here so let me get out

377
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:35,990
of this and back over to the

378
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:38,690
presentation so that's pretty much the

379
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,270
the the rundown for password spraying

380
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,930
and you know I really hope you guys have

381
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,980
a great time here at Kringle con and you

382
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,959
know if you want to follow me up on

383
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,370
through Adaptec and here's the link a

384
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,920
few links to the different tools that i

385
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:54,440
described so mail sniper domain password

386
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,790
spray and the RDP Spray proof of concept

387
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,090
thanks so much for coming to my talk

388
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,089
guys
