1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
hi everybody my name is Rachel Toback

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,629
and I'm gonna be talking about how I

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,220
would hack you today thank you so much

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,049
to Santa Claus for inviting me to the

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,070
North Pole I'm very excited to be here

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,320
at Kringle con so let's get started when

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,359
you think of a hacker trying to

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,220
infiltrate the system are you thinking

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,230
of something like this maybe a person

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,090
hacking under the cover of darkness

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,130
maybe they even have a hoodie on or

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,400
something like that or do you think of

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,590
something like this a person smiling

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,280
maybe calling to confirm the receipt of

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,710
an email talking to you over the phone

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,410
it turns out that the majority of cyber

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,260
attacks now start with some sort of

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,718
human element and this is actually how I

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,460
got my start as well I got my start in

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,950
the social engineering capture-the-flag

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,199
at DEFCON where I was actually a winner

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,469
for the last three years and what we do

23
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,300
is we hack companies live over the phone

24
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,460
and those companies do not know we're

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,099
calling but we're not malicious

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,170
we don't actually gain access to their

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,030
systems we simulate how we would get

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,939
access by getting them to go to fake

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,130
malicious URLs and this is an example of

30
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,199
what a social engineer might do to try

31
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,949
and get access to your machine's systems

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,590
or data so we're all aware that these

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,299
types of scams exist why is it that we

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,970
still fall for them if we know that

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,340
they're out there the reason that we

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,009
still fall for these two two scams is

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,990
because social engineers are exploiting

38
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,600
principles of persuasion that you can't

39
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,149
switch off their natural parts of who

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,329
you are and it's just a part of your

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,650
personality or your human behavior so if

42
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,509
you want to know more about how these

43
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,130
principles of persuasion work you can

44
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,770
read about them in robert cialdini's

45
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,570
book influence once we'll walk through

46
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,399
them here the first one is reciprocity

47
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,829
we feel a sense of indebtedness to

48
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,560
people who tell information about

49
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,380
themselves so if you tell me information

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,570
about yourself it's really likely that I

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,240
will share key pieces about what I do or

52
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,229
who I am an example of this is if I were

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,419
to come right up to you and say

54
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,840
something along lines of what operating

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,959
system do you use you would probably not

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,610
want to answer that question

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,680
because I haven't shared anything about

58
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,380
myself yet and it's very awkward to ask

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,300
a question like that to a person but if

60
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,280
I come up to you and I'm at my computer

61
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,710
and I'm really stressed out and I'm like

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,600
I have this talk coming up for krinkle

63
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,550
Khan and I cannot figure out how to

64
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,410
share my screen I think it's because I'm

65
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,910
on an old operating system I don't know

66
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,450
what my problem is I know nothing about

67
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,390
Macs

68
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,880
does anyone here have a Mac now somebody

69
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,190
is willing probably to say I am a Mac

70
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,320
right because we can all see that but

71
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,209
then five minutes down the line when

72
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,100
you're helping me with my computer it's

73
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,260
more likely at that point you might

74
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,420
start talking about what version you're

75
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,880
using of your operating system and that

76
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,040
those little pieces of information I can

77
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,420
use to piece together to be able to gain

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,200
access to your machine later down the

79
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:05,140
line the next one is commitment and

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,869
consistency we have to make thousands of

81
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,220
choices every single day and we don't

82
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,630
want to make one choice and then the

83
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,150
next and then the next that would be

84
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,519
extremely inefficient so what we do

85
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,010
instead is we make a choice and then we

86
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,380
apply that logic to any other choices

87
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,060
that would make sense a social engineer

88
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,340
knows that if you start giving them

89
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,720
information it's really likely that

90
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,600
you're going to continue getting that

91
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,340
information so for instance I don't come

92
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,290
right out and ask you what version of

93
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,660
your antivirus software you use even

94
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,070
though that's what I'm going for

95
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,620
instead I might start with a softball

96
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,170
question how your commute was today do

97
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,209
you have any pets if I hear maybe I play

98
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,420
sound of a barking dog in the background

99
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,829
of my call while I'm calling you if I

100
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,238
hear that you have a barking dog in the

101
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,940
background of yours and we start that

102
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,459
type of conversation now 25 minutes down

103
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,370
the line you don't want to stop and say

104
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:00,010
I'm sorry who are you again because

105
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,750
people don't like to feel irrational so

106
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,730
you commit and are consistent to your

107
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,750
previous choices because you don't want

108
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,609
to live in a world where you've been

109
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,920
giving this malicious person information

110
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,959
for the past 30 minutes on the phone in

111
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,859
person or for the past the past five

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,168
emails the next one we have here is

113
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,090
social proof people tend to trust people

114
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:22,299
that are in large groups their

115
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,799
co-workers or friends or bosses a social

116
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,800
engineer knows that if they can

117
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,490
name-drop people that you trust then

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,440
you're more like

119
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,080
to comply as well because you don't want

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,729
to be left out of the crowd so an

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,258
example of this is if I'm gonna call you

122
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,060
I'm gonna probably look up who your

123
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:40,060
friends are on Instagram Twitter

124
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,380
Facebook and if I have those names I'll

125
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,360
just work them seamlessly into the

126
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,759
conversation so I might say something

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,470
along the lines of oh hey Jay said I'm

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,880
so happy that we got to talk today ed

129
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,979
has told me so much about you

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,530
and if I have those little pieces of

131
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,180
information the right names it's really

132
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,929
likely the year to give me the right

133
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,479
information the next one we have here is

134
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,430
liking we tend to trust people that we

135
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,370
like and we like people who are similar

136
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,169
to us so as you can see in this people

137
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,690
are mimicking their hand motions back

138
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,490
and forth in this type of mimicking of

139
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,270
hand motions is something that humans

140
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,280
just naturally find trustworthy so a lot

141
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,568
of times we either mimic hand motions

142
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:26,020
voice tone phrases the way we speak our

143
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:27,909
intonation those little key factors help

144
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,068
us understand that we're similar to each

145
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:32,020
other and we can trust each other so

146
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,020
what I do before I call and actually

147
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,180
fish my targets I look up videos of how

148
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,330
they sound I try and find what their

149
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,460
voice sounds like their phrases how high

150
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,740
their voice is how low their voices and

151
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,508
I try and imitate that on the call I

152
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,580
don't want to do it too obviously

153
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:53,639
because then they'll be kind of on to me

154
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,639
but I try and just work it in seamlessly

155
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:58,330
the next one we have here is Authority

156
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,770
we trust people who sound like they know

157
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,370
what they're doing and this is really

158
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,948
simple

159
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,870
in general when I am going on to a

160
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,219
fishing call I choose a pretty high

161
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,349
status pretext

162
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,819
that's who I'm pretending to be so I'm

163
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:11,620
not going to usually call and pretend to

164
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:14,139
be an intern who's confused and scared

165
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,180
but rather I'm gonna call as someone's

166
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,460
boss's boss's boss someone they've heard

167
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,469
of but not talked to personally now keep

168
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,710
in mind I have done successful calls

169
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:25,719
from low status pretext but if you want

170
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,818
to go in with a pretty sure fire bet

171
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:31,180
pretext Authority is usually the right

172
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:34,240
way to go the next one we have here is

173
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,250
scarcity so this one's kind of sneaky we

174
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,860
tend to trust things that are put in

175
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,430
front of us under a sense of urgency

176
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,870
simply because we don't have time to

177
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,610
think about whether or not we should

178
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,250
answer those questions give that

179
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,840
information or something like that so if

180
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,460
I were to come right up to you and say

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,750
hey can you go to this link for me and

182
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,120
we're just sitting there at work

183
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,680
you'd be like mm I don't know that

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,690
doesn't sound like the right thing to do

185
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,650
I have been told before that that's not

186
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,560
the right thing to do

187
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,260
but if instead I say something along the

188
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,030
lines of hey I'm so sorry I'm actually

189
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:14,170
on the runway right now and sorry it's

190
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:14,169
really loud you can hear me www

191
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,050
malicious URL mom now in that scenario

192
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,270
it's way more likely that you're just

193
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,490
gonna type in that malicious URL because

194
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,039
you want to help me you want to be kind

195
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,770
and I've created a real sense of urgency

196
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,020
so you don't have any time to actually

197
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,390
think and wait and say that doesn't

198
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,590
sound right

199
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,450
so now that we've gone over these child

200
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,909
Leaney principles of persuasion watch

201
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,950
this video of a hacker breaking into

202
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,630
somebody's account in two minutes and

203
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,159
then think about which Chelsea any

204
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:51,830
principles of persuasion you're seeing

205
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,600
there and we'll talk about them a few of

206
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,359
the world's best hackers to try to hack

207
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,460
me and show me where my vulnerabilities

208
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,290
are and now I'm gonna meet them in Las

209
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:10,159
Vegas for DEFCON the biggest hacker

210
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:11,810
convention of the year you want to do a

211
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,700
sample the shingle what's phishing

212
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,010
phishing is boy solicitation and

213
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,200
basically what you do is use the phone

214
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,080
to extract information or data points

215
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,110
that can be used in a later attack let's

216
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,450
do it who are you gonna call maybe I'll

217
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,770
call your cell phone provider see if I

218
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,770
can get them to give your

219
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:49,380
hi I'm actually I'm so sorry can you

220
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:52,350
hear me okay my baby I'm sorry we just

221
00:08:49,380 --> 00:09:38,250
had a baby and he's like today so I'm so

222
00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:48,870
sorry I just uses my girlfriend's name

223
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:50,700
and a social she even gets the support

224
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,220
person to change my password thank you

225
00:09:50,700 --> 00:10:09,300
so much today so she just basically

226
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:15,050
blocked here out of my own and all it

227
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,050
took was a crying baby and a phone call

228
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,200
so that happened pretty fast let's walk

229
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,670
through what we saw there the first

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,520
thing that we saw in that call was

231
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,829
social proof she had the person's name

232
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,050
right so she was able to impersonate the

233
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,330
girlfriend and go through the call like

234
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,979
that the other thing that she did that

235
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,500
you might not have realized is that she

236
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,390
was spoofing the phone number to make it

237
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,040
present like she was calling from that

238
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,980
actual person's phone number we can do

239
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,810
this it takes about 10 to 15 seconds to

240
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,440
set up and it's pretty easy to do online

241
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,780
but that's a different talk the next one

242
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,940
we saw there was liking she was really

243
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,980
kind

244
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,269
not demanding and she had the baby

245
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,410
crying in the background which made her

246
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,880
feel like a bull

247
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,500
she also named dropped a lot of

248
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,200
information about herself and her

249
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,089
partner it made her seem relatable

250
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,390
information about being alone and things

251
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:10,459
like that the other thing that you saw

252
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,040
there was Authority and this was really

253
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:14,750
sneaky if you remember she said see I'm

254
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,130
not gonna be able to get a secure pin

255
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,430
because I'm gonna phone with you right

256
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,700
now

257
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,109
that's actually not true right but she

258
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,060
convinced somebody who works at a

259
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,480
cellphone provider that that is how it

260
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,790
works

261
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,959
she actually convinced them of that just

262
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,069
because she had that authority in her

263
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,469
tongue the next one we saw there was

264
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,720
urgency and this one was really sneaky

265
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,450
as well she actually created an outside

266
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,630
force that was acting upon her so she

267
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,240
had this bad guy right her husband and I

268
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,130
guess you could say who was telling her

269
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,600
that she had to apply and get this

270
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,950
information done by today and she had

271
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,320
these two crying babies

272
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,839
we then feel bad for her because she has

273
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,810
this entire outside force acting upon

274
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,270
her under a sense of urgency so she is

275
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,290
made to act quickly we think it's not

276
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,819
possible for her to be the bad guy

277
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,310
because she's got this other force

278
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,260
acting upon her so we try and help the

279
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:10,339
baby crying is also a fantastic sense of

280
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,230
urgency in and of itself so before we

281
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,660
actually get on these calls and we

282
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,760
actually do these pre texts and talk to

283
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,890
people social engineers are using social

284
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,200
media to prep we also use things like

285
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,810
multi go to understand about our targets

286
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,970
and make sure that we have clear pretext

287
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,219
but in general what I need to hack a

288
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,370
company in about ten minutes or less I

289
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,620
use Instagram LinkedIn Facebook things

290
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,630
like that

291
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,399
in fact 60% of the information that I

292
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,290
need to hack you is actually found on

293
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,980
Instagram alone and this is because of

294
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,040
two things first geolocation tagging and

295
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,839
second workstation photos so a lot of

296
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,880
pictures that we take at work we take

297
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,680
because it's our anniversary or we have

298
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,089
a birthday cake from our co-workers and

299
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,069
we want to show off how much we love our

300
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,899
work in our job but what's in the

301
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,130
background of that photo in the

302
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,350
background of that photo is a

303
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,420
workstation that's open and I can see

304
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,160
all of the software and possibly guess

305
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,930
which versions of that software you're

306
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,140
running just by looking at the out

307
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,270
logos or icons I can also see the schema

308
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,890
that you use on your folders for naming

309
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,720
and different conventions that you use

310
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,480
on your computer and having those little

311
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,330
bits of information help me reliably

312
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,220
pose as an insider because you know IT

313
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,050
support has access to your machine so I

314
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,540
could reliably pose as somebody an IT

315
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,760
support for example I would never be

316
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,010
able to see these photos or understand

317
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,660
what your computer has on it if you

318
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,939
didn't take a picture of it and tag it

319
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,110
to your work it would probably be hidden

320
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,779
and I wouldn't find that you worked

321
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,089
there unless you tagged at that specific

322
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,589
location on Instagram so what I go

323
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,240
through is I look through all the

324
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,880
addresses on Instagram by using the

325
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,920
places area on Instagram and then find

326
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,170
all of the addresses and find all of the

327
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,939
photos from there that's one example of

328
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,099
how we use social media there's many

329
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,170
other examples and we spend about 150

330
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,800
hours at least I do before I get on a

331
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,240
call to make sure it's seamless so let's

332
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,649
walk through a social engineering chain

333
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,550
so you can see everything that we talked

334
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,930
about step by step by step so the first

335
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,550
thing I'm looking to do is attack your

336
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,349
company let's say I've been commissioned

337
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,560
to do a phishing attack on your company

338
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,260
to see how far I can get so I am looking

339
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,790
to find information about let's say I'm

340
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,170
looking for the endgame of your

341
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,910
antivirus I would like to know the

342
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,219
version of that but I need to do a lot

343
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,230
of steps beforehand so I go on Instagram

344
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,450
and I find a geotag to Instagram

345
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,240
computer photo and right there in the

346
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,070
tray I see it the Symantec icon down

347
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,450
there in that bottom tray and I'm really

348
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,860
excited about it because it looks a

349
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,680
little bit outdated which is fantastic

350
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,560
for me so let's walk through what I do I

351
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,229
need to call as IT support to confirm

352
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,270
that you actually have Symantec and that

353
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,220
specific version I'm thinking it's 4.2

354
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,020
with a lot of known vulnerabilities

355
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,640
which is gonna be great because then I

356
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,850
can tailor my malware to avoid detection

357
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,370
on your machine so I need to call and

358
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,140
reliably pose as IT support if I'm

359
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,850
calling a large company I'll pick

360
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,620
somebody who's an IT support who's

361
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,899
female because I can reliably pose as

362
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,329
that person but if it's a smaller

363
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,130
company I might need to pose as a vendor

364
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,779
because you probably know everybody in

365
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,089
IT support so that's kind of how I'd

366
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:15,410
select who I'm pretending to be so I'm

367
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,730
gonna call and say something along the

368
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,939
lines of

369
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,110
this is Ali we just had Daniel call me

370
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,160
and say that there are a couple of

371
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,079
different machines that were acting

372
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,019
weird on the network and we think it

373
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,310
might be because you have an outdated

374
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,779
semantics do you have the antivirus

375
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,910
software on your computer you sit at

376
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,529
little yellow shields okay if you could

377
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,569
just right-click on that for me and see

378
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,550
if it's version 4.2 if it is you're good

379
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,339
to go if it's not then we'll want to

380
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,540
update to 4.2 for you okay you see that

381
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,360
all right great

382
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,760
Thanks so that's how fast it happens

383
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,709
once I know that you have that specific

384
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,899
version of that antivirus with known

385
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:52,849
vulnerabilities on your computer I will

386
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,000
tailor my malware to avoid detection on

387
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,680
your machine and send the exploit so

388
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,089
that sounds really scary a lot of people

389
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,430
think well how could I possibly defend

390
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,500
against that there are many ways you can

391
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,029
keep yourself safe so how to defend

392
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,339
against social engineering the first

393
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:09,380
thing that I always say is be politely

394
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,459
paranoid you don't have to be rude to

395
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,990
people you don't have to hang up on

396
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:15,229
every single person that calls you

397
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,300
though I usually do but if somebody

398
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,459
calls you and they pretend to be someone

399
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,810
that you're just not sure about you just

400
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:22,939
want to make sure you use what I like to

401
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,550
call real-world two-factor

402
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,560
authentication so if somebody calls you

403
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,569
email them back if you already have an

404
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,010
email for them and if they call you they

405
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,599
might be spoofing a phone number so you

406
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,760
can just say hey I'm stepping into a

407
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,170
meeting can I give you a call back they

408
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,160
know they're probably burned at that

409
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,959
point because you're gonna give a

410
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,910
callback to that number and it's not

411
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,680
going to go to the criminal it's going

412
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,149
to go to the actual person's number and

413
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,769
they're not gonna have any idea about

414
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,199
what they quote-unquote called you about

415
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,880
the other thing to think about is it's

416
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,979
really important to talk to client

417
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,380
facing staff about this because when I

418
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,569
go and try and attack a company the

419
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,189
first people I go after are not what

420
00:16:56,569 --> 00:17:00,079
people always think a lot of people

421
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,209
think my first attack vector is gonna be

422
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,119
to go through customer support but in

423
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:07,819
general I go through finance hiring

424
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,379
managers recruiters a lot of times its

425
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,119
kind of the softer targets the folks

426
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,339
that don't expect an attack to come

427
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,750
customer support is really well trained

428
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,730
and so they're likely to shove you down

429
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,770
so it's important to talk to everybody

430
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,990
who's client facing anyone who would

431
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,270
reliably pick up a phone process an

432
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,370
invoice talk to anybody from the outside

433
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,619
world for example an office manager

434
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,350
collects packages and really understands

435
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,479
the ins and outs of your company I will

436
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,760
we go after that person first before

437
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,280
customer support so those folks need to

438
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,559
be trained to the last thing is

439
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,210
two-factor authentication the technical

440
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,370
kind is really essential to keep

441
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,830
yourself safe it's important to train

442
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,168
your humans but human beings are

443
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,510
fallible in our point with training is

444
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,130
never to get to zero click-through rate

445
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,390
because it's just impossible right

446
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,950
you're good people are gonna make

447
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,010
mistakes and so we need to have those

448
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,910
technical backups to make sure that we

449
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,090
can keep folks safe

450
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,409
so having two-factor enables you to make

451
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,360
sure that a hacker can knock it into

452
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,220
your account if they do have access to

453
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,809
it through other means another thing

454
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,880
that you can install is a password

455
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:12,590
manager for everybody at your company

456
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,140
your friends or your parents or whoever

457
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,658
else that you know and love that way if

458
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,429
they go to a fake URL something that's

459
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,200
going to be malicious the password

460
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:23,780
manager won't recognize that as

461
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,340
authentic and won't input your password

462
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,200
that's another really good way to

463
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,699
protect yourself against hackers like

464
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,460
myself and actual real-life criminals so

465
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,870
many people say that humans are actually

466
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,510
your weakest link but I completely

467
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,580
disagree I think when humans understand

468
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,530
what happens they can actually be your

469
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,399
first line of defense to protect you

470
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:48,260
your family your friends your co-workers

471
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
again social engineering and so that's

472
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,710
pretty much it

473
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,740
thank you have a great time at the North

474
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,740
Pole
