1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
hello and welcome to Kringle Con I want

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,720
to show just a tremendous amount of

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,750
respect and gratitude to Santa Claus for

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,000
having me out here it was fantastic to

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,070
get me up to the balmy North Pole from

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,809
the from the hinterlands of South Dakota

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,789
so it's great to get away and have a

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,288
slight vacation and I want to spend a

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,390
little bit of time and talk about cloud

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,949
security assessments and why cloud

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,109
security assessments and the way we look

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,910
at the cloud is fundamentally important

13
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,710
and transformative to the way that we're

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,330
going to be handling network penetration

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,790
testing especially over the next five to

16
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,890
ten years so we're gonna draw dive right

17
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,360
in now this particular this particular

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,090
section this particular presentation

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,530
goes really well with Bo's presentation

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,420
about password spraying everything you

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,120
wanted to know but was afraid to ask and

22
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,170
I want to continue that as well so we're

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,769
gonna dive in we're gonna talk about

24
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,949
creds credentials are absolutely key for

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,899
any kind of online cloud based attack

26
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,430
that you're going to be doing the reason

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,829
why is it pretty much drives everything

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,289
and once you gain access to one service

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,059
with credentials usually you then gain

30
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,710
access to a large number of additional

31
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,420
services so a good example of that would

32
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,548
be if you're looking at Microsoft Azure

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,860
once you're able to authenticate and

34
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,479
you're in one port once you're in your

35
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,520
aji and you can move over to all the

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,009
other services and the same is also true

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,020
whenever you look at Google you look at

38
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,270
Gmail you look at Google Apps domains a

39
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,259
lot of third-party software from github

40
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,960
all the way over to Twitter - - let's

41
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,970
just say Trello anything all tie into

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,130
that Google authentication so once

43
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,650
you've authenticated successfully into

44
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,939
Google then you can then move laterally

45
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,829
to a large number of additional

46
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,419
applications as well so we have a

47
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,039
tremendous amount of luck at Black Hills

48
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,380
information security and actually doing

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,490
this level of password spring and we

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,189
want to spread throughout a special

51
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,229
thanks to Microsoft and Google and why

52
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,059
does this matter so much well this is an

53
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,090
attack that's been in the OWASP top 10

54
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,280
for pretty much since the inception if

55
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,049
we can differentiate whenever we send in

56
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,540
a request to an authentication portal

57
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,820
between valid credentials and invalid

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,590
credentials it makes it exceedingly easy

59
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,360
for us to automate this as you can see

60
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,539
in the lower right hand corner to

61
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,550
quickly identify what are valid accounts

62
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,349
and which ones are invalid accounts and

63
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,390
yes even if you have two-factor

64
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,220
authentication

65
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,679
many web portals many cloud-based

66
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,330
services you'll see a timing difference

67
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,430
between a valid set of credentials in an

68
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,170
invalid set of credentials or sometimes

69
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,670
it'll come straight back and tell you

70
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,309
hey you've successfully authenticated

71
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,160
with the user ID and password now it's

72
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,350
time for your two FA and we can use that

73
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,900
to harvest those user IDs and we can

74
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,850
harvest those passwords also there's

75
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,310
additional problems that exist in cloud

76
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,840
infrastructure oh this is a problem that

77
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,080
was discovered by medic falchion Bobo

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,660
like where you could actually submit a

79
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,120
basic email not a necessarily email you

80
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,430
could send in requests to someone's

81
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,600
calendar and you could send in hundreds

82
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,940
of them and they would show up on

83
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,340
people's calendar and they would

84
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,590
basically pop in without the user ever

85
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,840
clicking a link or accepting it and it

86
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,520
would just flood their inbox further you

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,530
could even send an additional requests

88
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,500
that you could accept those calendar

89
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,600
invites as well so we use this often in

90
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,000
spearfishing assessments so we'll send

91
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,160
in an account under invite basically

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,260
saying hey super important meeting at

93
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,000
the North Pole crinkled con you've gotta

94
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,470
be there and it'll show up on your

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,970
calendar 10 minutes before it starts you

96
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,400
get this pop-up and it says hey you've

97
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,690
got this really super important meeting

98
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,970
that you've got to be at the North

99
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,920
portal but before you go to this meeting

100
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,050
you're gonna needs to review these

101
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,450
documents and then once they click the

102
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,970
link then we can start trying to harvest

103
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,799
those credentials now the tool behind

104
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,209
this is called cred sniper now there's a

105
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,860
number of tools that actually do this

106
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,450
but we're partial to it because it's

107
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,000
written by our very own po bollock and

108
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,429
Mike found and what this does is proxy

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,980
that authentication between the user

110
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,510
who's trying to access a resource or

111
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,670
thinks that they're accessing a resource

112
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,040
that is at Google and then Google itself

113
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,170
it's kind of a man-in-the-middle

114
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,390
framework for authentication so whenever

115
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,970
the user clicks that link it actually

116
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,559
harvests their images from Picasa their

117
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,300
picture whatever their profile picture

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,750
is from their corporation or their

119
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,220
personal profile whatever pops it up and

120
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,959
it looks just like Google's

121
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,600
authentication it asks you for your

122
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,880
email it also asks you for your password

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,830
and then it asks you for your two-factor

124
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,419
authentication now while you're putting

125
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,859
in all of that information the

126
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,419
two-factor authentication

127
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,500
while you're putting in the information

128
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,109
with the user ID

129
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,840
and password the male sniper tool in the

130
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,390
background is actually going to Google

131
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,119
and authenticating so it's forwarding

132
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:41,630
all of that information onto Google and

133
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,610
then logging in once it logs into Google

134
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,740
it automatically has the capability to

135
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,260
generate an app password that doesn't

136
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,000
require two-factor authentication

137
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,520
automatically puts in a filter that will

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,190
filter out any security warning warnings

139
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,049
from Google and it pretty much gives you

140
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,969
full access to their files in the

141
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,980
backend so if we're crying trying to

142
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,390
simplify what this is because this

143
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,640
particular picture looks kind of

144
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,349
complicated you have lots of lines and

145
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,820
it's a flow chart and I hate flow charts

146
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,740
and then you got wires and the network

147
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,409
operations center closet and that just

148
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,960
looks scary let's boil it down sets up a

149
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,020
fishing server captures two-factor has

150
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,180
the ability to bypass you to FA as well

151
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,159
suppresses all Google security messages

152
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,570
creates an app password and that allows

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,940
you to pillage and everything is

154
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:30,349
connected in your world to Google pretty

155
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:33,440
much absolutely everything so this is an

156
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,870
easy tool and it should serve as kind of

157
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,320
a framework for your cloud security

158
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,880
pentesting adventures look at how

159
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,710
authentic ation actually works how does

160
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,600
the API work when you're looking at

161
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,219
almost any authentication portal it has

162
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,350
the ability to authenticate once through

163
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,380
like a single sign-on and then you can

164
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,000
reuse that authentication again and

165
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,270
again and again and a wide variety of

166
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,400
different services that are provided so

167
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,560
go out and get cred sniper we absolutely

168
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,330
love it we provided the links here and a

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,580
much longer presentation by beau and

170
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,919
Mike covering this also a very special

171
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,409
heads up please please please be careful

172
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,299
Google does not like this now we're just

173
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,950
using Google as an example you can also

174
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,720
do oh and a number of other portals

175
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,669
using these exact same types of

176
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,979
techniques but by and large you're

177
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:21,740
violating Terms of Service now is it

178
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:24,580
illegal that's debatable if you have

179
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,500
full authentication and authorization

180
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,630
for in the form of a contract do a pen

181
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,270
test against a company and you're hired

182
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,100
to replicate what it attacker will will

183
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,979
do against that company this falls in

184
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,330
the category of what evil people would

185
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,460
do to try to break into those

186
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,300
organizations now do you want to anger

187
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,390
Google

188
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,940
really no if they ban you your family

189
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,070
your pets and block your IP addresses

190
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,770
and send Deadpool after you that could

191
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,560
all be a very bad thing so please be

192
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,030
careful so what have we learned when

193
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,460
we're talking about trying to be careful

194
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,369
well we've learned that if you try to go

195
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,229
up directly against Dino shark or if you

196
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,270
try to go up against Sharktopus in

197
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,700
almost all of these movies there's a

198
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,169
scene where the hero or hero wannabe or

199
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,300
a villain tries to stand up to these

200
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,580
horrible horrible monsters and then gets

201
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,560
eaten and what we've discovered all the

202
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,590
way back to the Godzilla movies and

203
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,120
Mothra and mecha godzilla is the best

204
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,679
thing you can do with monsters is to

205
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,870
actually turn them against each other

206
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,660
and that's what we recommend here so

207
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,990
this is cred King what cred King allows

208
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,330
you to do is password spray using Amazon

209
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,190
lamda now why would you actually want to

210
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,169
do this well let's use an example let's

211
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,940
say that Amazon is Dino shark and you're

212
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,220
trying to break in to Google which is

213
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,320
Sharktopus well you can't attack shark

214
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,230
to post directly why don't you use Dino

215
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,450
shark ie Amazon to actually pass word

216
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,970
spray against Google or Sharktopus and

217
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,219
that's exactly what the cred King toll

218
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,650
will allow you to do you do that spray

219
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,360
you spray against Google and it appears

220
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,700
to be coming from Amazon lambda and the

221
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,830
reason why this works is because by and

222
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,360
large these very very large corporations

223
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,969
I don't want to say that they trust each

224
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,620
other because there's I'm sure seething

225
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,360
levels of hatred between these companies

226
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,090
but they know if they all of a sudden

227
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,370
start blocking and blacklist sting IP

228
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,130
addresses from Amazon lambda that

229
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,380
they're gonna start degrading the

230
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,090
capabilities for their customers to do

231
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,040
their work because these large cloud

232
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,380
service providers are integrated with

233
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,210
each other so by turning them against

234
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,880
each other we now have the ability to do

235
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,739
spring pretty much at will without

236
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,080
really worrying too much about getting

237
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,060
eaten by sharks APIs or the Dino shark

238
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,970
and I honestly believe that not getting

239
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:41,150
eaten by shark to post dine in a shark

240
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:43,310
or honestly polar bears do be careful if

241
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,959
you go outside just there's there's

242
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:48,709
polar bears out there so be careful

243
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,870
that's just a bad day also the point the

244
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,330
point is many people in computer

245
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,080
security who really don't understand

246
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,450
network penetration testing

247
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,800
and people that fundamentally do not

248
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,500
understand what it takes to actually

249
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,300
break into an organization they believe

250
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,070
that everything in computer security is

251
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,040
all about zero days what are the

252
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:11,070
exploits that can be leveraged to attack

253
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,180
a remote service you know if you talk

254
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,560
about the government well we need to

255
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,140
know we need to zero in a to get into

256
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,849
this guy's iPhone not necessarily

257
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,800
because if you're looking at devices

258
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,510
like iPhones this also fits into the

259
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,449
cloud security model as well if you look

260
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,420
at I phones and Android devices these

261
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,090
devices pretty much sync absolutely

262
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,920
everything up in the cloud all of their

263
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,410
contacts all of their emails all of

264
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,349
their files their pictures everything

265
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,880
gets synced up to the cloud so if you're

266
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,830
trying to break into that device it's

267
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,140
kind of unnecessary and it kind of

268
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,310
defeats the principle of what you're

269
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,410
trying to do when you're doing a pen

270
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,449
test or doing an attack against an

271
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,910
organization you're not necessarily

272
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,640
after getting root or shell you're after

273
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,370
the data that you can get after you get

274
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,230
root or shell and always keep that in

275
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,120
mind because if you ever have somebody

276
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,710
anybody in the community that thinks

277
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,900
that all of penetration testing is

278
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,480
nothing but exploits they truly had a

279
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,150
very deep deep level do not know what

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,690
they're talking about however if we flip

281
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,819
that over

282
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,380
if somebody's password is for furries

283
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,420
forever even if they have two-factor

284
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,570
authentication we can still get access

285
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,890
to the exact same data so when you're

286
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,620
pen testing when you're doing cyber

287
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,810
offensive operation never ever lose

288
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,360
sight of what the end objective is

289
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,060
number one and number two never ever

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,910
lose sight of the easiest way to try to

291
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,339
gain access to those data to that data

292
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,020
set as well so what then

293
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,210
a number of additional tools that are

294
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,310
fantastic if you want to bypass Oh a

295
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,570
two-factor authentication enter mail

296
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,550
sniper once again the tool was created

297
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,410
by bull Bullock and what this tool

298
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,729
allows you to do is it allows you to

299
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,219
bypass that two-factor authentication

300
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,350
what is which is great but the thing

301
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,110
that's the most important here for me is

302
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,480
it gives you the test or the ability to

303
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,880
actually search through the email of

304
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,180
that user or that particular

305
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,980
organization why is that an important

306
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,900
point well this is an incredibly

307
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,940
important point because it articulates

308
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,470
that when you're attacking cloud-based

309
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,770
infrastructure sometimes gaining access

310
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,200
to just a single account is enough to

311
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,460
crack that door open and then gain

312
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,990
access to a whole bunch of additional

313
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,420
data let me explain

314
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,090
so many organizations you'll have very

315
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,099
important people and what they'll do is

316
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,680
they'll delegate access to their inbox

317
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,840
to somebody else and whenever they

318
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,449
delegate that access to the lower-level

319
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,860
person in the organization to actually

320
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,940
check their email validate their email

321
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,220
tell them what email is actually

322
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,260
important then they mess up and they'll

323
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,170
say that we're gonna open up my I'm

324
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,150
going to open up my inbox to everybody

325
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,150
mail sniper has the capability of

326
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,459
finding those inboxes where people have

327
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,140
over delegated the responsibility of

328
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,810
their inbox to not just a particular

329
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,790
person but to the entire organization

330
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,180
and then you can search through those

331
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:02,880
emails as well it is absolutely

332
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,380
phenomenal and the reason why this is

333
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,760
important I think for everybody that's

334
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,170
listening to this is all of us are doing

335
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,300
cyber offensive operations we're

336
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,790
spending a lot of time gaining access to

337
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,260
the endpoint we're writing malware we're

338
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,150
gaining access we're pivoting we're

339
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,600
using bloodhound we're using PowerShell

340
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:21,360
Empire but here's the trick a lot of

341
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,860
those tools as of right now are being

342
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,750
detected by many advanced security

343
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,210
products be it endpoint security

344
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,090
products like like CrowdStrike or

345
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,590
silence or carbon black or they're being

346
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,870
detected through user behavioral and

347
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,300
entity analytics like Microsoft advanced

348
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,680
threat analytics or whatever rapid7 is

349
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,060
calling their product before they change

350
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,829
the name a number of times but the point

351
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,290
is there's a lot of technologies that

352
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,420
are detecting the exact same pathways

353
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,819
that we're using again and again and

354
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,979
again what's beautiful about male sniper

355
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,350
is it allows you to kind of sidestep

356
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,000
that ability to be detected by a number

357
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,850
of those different products by looking

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,680
through email an email has not really

359
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,770
looked at as important by many of these

360
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,839
security products as files on servers or

361
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,520
domain authentication but it is

362
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,710
incredibly valuable you think about it

363
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,780
almost anything that has any value to

364
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,820
your organization is going to be sent in

365
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,530
an email and mail sniper gives you the

366
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,930
ability to actually go through and

367
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,550
search through that email and this ties

368
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,370
in once again with the idea of cloud

369
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,529
based attacks once you gain access what

370
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,779
other API is what other avenues can

371
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,639
you use to try to gain access to that

372
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,560
sensitive data that would exist in an

373
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,540
organization once again all of those

374
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,029
super elite people that talk about zero

375
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,219
days they truly do not understand how to

376
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,139
break into organizations they just don't

377
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,519
they've got a cool trick they break into

378
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,749
systems they write zero days and trust

379
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,480
me that's neat

380
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:45,269
but honestly this is the stuff that's

381
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,620
going to create the highest risk profile

382
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:50,069
for an organization because their

383
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,930
sensitive data is in fact in the emails

384
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:54,059
so as you're aware some additional

385
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,649
things that you can do we've been doing

386
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,290
a lot of research on the Azure platform

387
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:01,290
and with the Shoreham you can harvest

388
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,939
from the Internet users groups group

389
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,879
membership service principal names

390
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:07,769
applications and you can also add guests

391
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,839
to user accounts which is weird

392
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:12,480
all of this with a standard user account

393
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,160
so this is just the result of one week

394
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,129
of research by a couple of people at the

395
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,410
h is Mike and Bo and they were able to

396
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:22,589
pull down just an amazing attack surface

397
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,300
for as you're one week so this means for

398
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,249
everybody that's like listening to this

399
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,189
right now here at the North Pole at

400
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:30,569
Santa's cast so if you're trying to make

401
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:31,920
a name for yourself in computer security

402
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,110
if you're trying to get out there you're

403
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,479
trying to make an impact to computer

404
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,220
security you can go down that exact same

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,100
path as everyone else endpoint security

406
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,660
bypass you can try to learn how to write

407
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,430
zero days and impress the other wizards

408
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,740
who generally are not people that are

409
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,569
impressible under normal circumstances

410
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,949
or you can look at these huge green

411
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:52,620
fields of all these different cloud

412
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:53,849
based API is and there's amazing things

413
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,500
that can be learned and it's not

414
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,790
necessarily about hacking or getting

415
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:02,040
shell but understand and what interfaces

416
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,449
are created for administrators and how

417
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,519
those administrator and of those

418
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,729
administrative interfaces can be used

419
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,579
further what can you access as a

420
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,470
standard user and then you start to see

421
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,750
how this ties together standard user

422
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,720
account password spray or Spearfish

423
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,339
gained access to an API on the cloud

424
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,439
with a standard user and then how can

425
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,990
you leverage that to gain additional

426
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:26,579
access to the rest of the environment

427
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,620
final section the browser is the new end

428
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,388
point without logout ends we have the

429
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,230
ability to get creds login to office 365

430
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,759
at an add in sync everywhere and what's

431
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,449
cool about this is with these add-ins

432
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,949
and with these

433
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:40,589
buggins you can do things like add a

434
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:42,508
beef hook harvest creds all kinds of fun

435
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,939
things that you can do and if you want

436
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,499
kind of a conceptual framework on why we

437
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:48,660
should be looking at this look at

438
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:51,509
something like grammarly grandma leech X

439
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,819
all of your spelling constantly checks

440
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:55,559
your overall grammar of sentence it is

441
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:58,439
literally a key logger in your browser

442
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,389
and it doesn't take anyone with a little

443
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:03,480
bit of background of experience for any

444
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:05,669
development to really work all that hard

445
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,569
to create a plug-in that would do

446
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:09,209
something similar

447
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:12,149
also LastPass LastPass monitors

448
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:14,758
absolutely every page and every form

449
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,879
that you go into to provide you with the

450
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,919
password or suggest for you a password

451
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,959
for that particular page so let's start

452
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,850
looking at the browser a lot more so all

453
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,258
of this matters when you're looking at

454
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,230
these attacks they are no longer

455
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,669
straight forward attacks they require a

456
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,009
bit of setup they require an

457
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:34,379
architecture and this is important

458
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:36,230
because this field looking at the cloud

459
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,509
is not going away

460
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,429
Josh Wright has this fantastic quote

461
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,410
that he had a number of years ago where

462
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:46,049
he was discussing that most vendors do

463
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,789
not want a patch of vulnerability until

464
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:50,069
a Metasploit exploit has been released

465
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:52,230
and then and only then will they patch

466
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:53,429
it these particular vulnerabilities and

467
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,289
tacks that we're talking about they

468
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,419
aren't exactly Metasploit able style

469
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,919
attacks so they're probably not going to

470
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:00,509
be patched if they're not going to be

471
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,399
patched it means that we're gonna be

472
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:04,289
able to attack them for a good long time

473
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,699
so I want to say thank you very much

474
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,250
let's start taking apart the cloud

475
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,049
silence is all about failing and taking

476
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,898
notes so don't be afraid to fail don't

477
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:15,240
be afraid to learn as much as you

478
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:17,458
possibly can about all these crazy api's

479
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,349
just get out there thank you so much and

480
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,589
I hope you have a great time here at the

481
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,589
North Pole
