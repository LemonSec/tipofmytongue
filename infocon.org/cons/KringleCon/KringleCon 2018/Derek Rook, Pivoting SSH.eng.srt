00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
hello Kringle kaan and welcome to my

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,219
talk pivoting with SSH my name is Derek

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,630
rook and like to thank everybody for

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,340
coming all the way up to the North Pole

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,290
and a special thank you to Santa Claus

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,020
for bringing all the hackers together to

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,560
you know make sure that Christmas moving

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,500
forward is a safe and relatively

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,570
frictionless event unlike some previous

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,570
years so we've got a lot to cover so

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,250
let's just jump right into it first of

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,260
all you may be asking yourself why why

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,350
are we talking about SSH and a hacking

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,030
conference why why this is remote

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,149
administration work and and that's true

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,559
maybe you want to use SSH pivoting or

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,230
port forwarding for some remote

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,030
administration but also if you're on an

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,519
engagement and you I need to access some

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,039
protected networks you're able to get a

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,809
foothold on on one system that's inside

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,120
a protected Network you can use this

23
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,440
technique to pivot to the rest of the

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,099
network and start attacking some of

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,570
those protected hosts

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,960
additionally some administrators like to

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,610
put services on localhost only bindings

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,100
so they only listen to you know the

29
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,659
local host address and we can use SSH

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,729
pivoting to attack those services as

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,049
well and as we move through the

32
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,590
techniques I have some demos to show

33
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,210
exactly what I'm talking about here our

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,909
first technique is going to be called

35
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,470
local port forwarding and we tell SSH

36
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,229
that we're going to do that with a -

37
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,850
capital L and we'll walk through the

38
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,979
rest of the syntax here just to give you

39
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,250
a brief overview and then we'll also

40
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:35,250
give you I have some demos in just a

41
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,159
second so after the after we tell SSH

42
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,409
that we're doing local port forwarding

43
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,600
we then put the the port on our local

44
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,979
machine that we're going to forward so

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,939
this will be the one that we connect to

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:51,539
on our local machine then we tell SSH

47
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,669
what target host what host has the port

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,040
we want to get to that we want to attack

49
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,750
and when we're doing local port

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,500
forwarding something interesting to know

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,840
here is that when when you this host is

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,850
in relation to your pivot host so if you

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,759
use local host here this is actually the

54
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,310
host er it's it's targeting local host

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,649
on the machine your SS aging to

56
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,090
so then we have our target port that's

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,010
the one we actually want to attack or

58
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,350
connect to and then our pivot host this

59
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,459
is the host will actually be SSA Qing

60
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,079
too and as I mentioned I have some demos

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:30,450
here so we'll jump right into the first

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:33,209
one and here I have two windows to bash

63
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,280
windows that are on my local machine and

64
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,590
then I have to bash Windows that are on

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,470
a remote machine and as you can see on

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,260
the remote machine I have a HTTP server

67
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,109
that's bound to the localhost so it's

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,959
not running to where I can hit it from

69
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,540
outside and I ran an LS o F to kind of

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,950
prove that yes Python 3 is listening

71
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:00,510
only on localhost so if we run an nmap

72
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,299
on this host we actually see that port

73
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,090
80s filtered which is what we'd expect

74
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:10,370
but we can SSH and forward a local port

75
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,540
and we'll forward 8080 to and remember

76
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,489
when we're talking about local port

77
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,750
forwarding if we put localhost here

78
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:23,130
we're actually referring to the

79
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:26,549
destination server I put my phrasing for

80
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,250
my key and now rest this H 10 so what's

81
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,320
what's happening is we still can't hit

82
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,209
it directly right we're still we still

83
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,200
don't have access to port 80 from the

84
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:42,720
outside however if we curl localhost

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,730
remember we're forwarding a local port

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,630
here we're forwarding port 8080 on a

87
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,828
local port 280 on the remote host and

88
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,269
actually hit enter and here's our

89
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,120
welcome to kringle con it's time to

90
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,769
party message with you know true party

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,070
fashion it's blinking and everything if

92
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,290
we open this up in a web browser so

93
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,420
that's local port forwarding let's jump

94
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,810
right back into the presentation here

95
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,518
and we'll talk about remote port

96
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,040
forwarding and some people call this

97
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,350
reverse port forwarding it acts kind of

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,320
like a river shell but we'll discuss it

99
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,640
a little bit now this gets a bit brain

100
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,830
bendy so stay with me through they

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,479
explain a shouldn't of the syntax and

102
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,109
then we'll jump into another example to

103
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,419
hopefully

104
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,060
get a little more clear so we use a -

105
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,330
capital R to tell SSH that we're remote

106
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,979
port forwarding and this our port this

107
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,060
is how remote port forwarding works

108
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:40,770
we're going to forward a port on the

109
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,250
pivot host on the post that we're

110
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:48,180
actually SSA Qing - we're going to Ford

111
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,330
a port on that machine to a host and

112
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,729
port that our initiating client can

113
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,710
access okay and and maybe you're not

114
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,150
quite seeing why you would want to do

115
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,370
this but I'll show you in just a second

116
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,460
so this is the remote port that we're

117
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,009
going to forward from the pivot host

118
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,318
this is the host that we're targeting

119
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,870
and when we're when we're forwarding

120
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,090
remote ports this is from the

121
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,180
perspective our of our initiating client

122
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,638
so if we put localhost in the target

123
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,039
host that's localhost on our initiating

124
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,139
machine okay not on the pivot host it's

125
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,960
opposite of the way local port

126
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,580
forwarding worked it doesn't have to be

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,830
localhost it can be any host that our

128
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,529
initiating machine has it can can hit

129
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,719
over the network target ports the same

130
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:36,029
thing that's the port that we're trying

131
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:39,960
to get the port forwarding to forward to

132
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,819
so if we do do localhost on our target

133
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,239
host then maybe we're trying to get it

134
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:48,330
to our local port 22 - SSH locally and

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,789
then the pivot host the SSH host again

136
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:55,948
and now that you're thoroughly confused

137
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:58,800
let's bring this home with an example so

138
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,650
let's imagine that before you left for

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,689
Kringle Khan you are we're working on

140
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,188
something at home or you know you've got

141
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:07,979
a server running at home you've got some

142
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:10,319
home automation maybe you have you know

143
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,729
a doorbell camera that you don't have on

144
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,759
the internet but you want to monitor

145
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,318
while you're away but at home you don't

146
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,650
have a static IP address you don't have

147
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:24,330
a VPN set up to VPN directly into home

148
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,339
so what do you do well you can if you

149
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,490
have a remotely accessible server like I

150
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,969
do in the in the quote/unquote cloud you

151
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:36,330
can use remote port forwarding to

152
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:39,029
forward a port on your remote machine

153
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,539
back into your local machine even though

154
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:42,270
it's behind a

155
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,680
firewall because you're doing a you're

156
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,419
actually connecting out to it from

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
behind the firewall so that's why a lot

158
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,590
of people call it like a reverse port

159
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,840
forward or like a reverse shell because

160
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,810
it kind of operates like one so we're

161
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,650
going to forward port 2 2 2 2 on the

162
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:03,120
remote machine to localhost port 22 and

163
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,830
there's a remote machine so this is the

164
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,660
same syntax we saw before we hit enter

165
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,800
authenticate to the server and now it's

166
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,930
running now for as long as this SSH is

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,080
open as long as this connection is is

168
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:23,130
valid over here on our remote server we

169
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,500
can SSH through at local host because

170
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,409
we're forwarding a reporting and IP

171
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,640
addres a fort on the remote host this

172
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,650
localhost to port 2 2 2 2 okay so we're

173
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:45,560
at stitching to ourselves actually I can

174
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:45,560
show this another way if we - - - -

175
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:03,030
whoops we can actually see that we're

176
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,190
listening on port 2 2 2 2 now ok so so

177
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:09,500
this is us SSH itself is listening on

178
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:13,440
port 2 2 2 2 so we can SSH to localhost

179
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,920
root at local host because you know

180
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,560
Callie doesn't know about users and

181
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:26,280
we'll SSH 2 2 2 2 2 and we type in the

182
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,000
super-secret root password and Here I am

183
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,859
on my local machine so anywhere say from

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,860
here at critical con that I can access

185
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,110
my remote server in the cloud I can

186
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,919
actually SSH back into my local network

187
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,140
at home

188
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,569
and do any sort of work that I needed to

189
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,550
do or check you know the the camera

190
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:50,130
doorbell or whatever whatever I needed

191
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,670
to do so that is extremely handy let's

192
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,490
back out of this

193
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,490
we'll jump back into our last

194
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:04,060
second to last type of pivot now this is

195
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,100
extremely helpful helpful this is

196
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,670
actually a proxy jump post know what

197
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,770
this does is imagine a time which I'm

198
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,579
sure none of you have had to do where

199
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,290
you wanted to get to machine five but in

200
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,900
order to get to machine five you had to

201
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,089
ssh into machine one and then ssh into

202
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,380
machine two and then three and then four

203
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,790
and then finally you could get to five

204
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,890
because of they're all on different

205
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,500
networks and they all only have like

206
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,319
access to each other right we can

207
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,040
actually use jump post to simplify that

208
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,410
that process okay so we use a - capital

209
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,920
j to tell ssh that we're going to use a

210
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:45,010
jump post and we specify the

211
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,880
intermediary ssh server that we need to

212
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,350
get to this is just the one that we have

213
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,320
to bounce through you can think of it

214
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,910
similar to a web proxy except this is

215
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,700
you're just jumping through you're just

216
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,900
proxying through an ssh server and then

217
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,130
the eventual hosts that you want to get

218
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:08,680
to as always we've got a demo kind of

219
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:10,090
drive this home now the there's a couple

220
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,859
things I want to point out here so we

221
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,090
have our local boxes here and I know

222
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,150
this is a little hard to read because

223
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,340
I'm trying to keep the the font big

224
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,650
enough for the people in the back but we

225
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,040
have our local machine here we have a

226
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:27,220
jump one box here okay and it doesn't

227
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,370
have any IP table restrictions jump two

228
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,950
however will accept only connections

229
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,340
from SSH connections from jump one and

230
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:38,020
it'll drop any other SSH connections

231
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:41,560
coming into it so only jump one can

232
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,240
access through SSH jump two and then on

233
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,599
jump three we have something similar so

234
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,270
it'll only accept SSH connections from

235
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,970
jump two it'll drop any other SSH

236
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:56,020
connections another interesting thing is

237
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:59,560
that it actually can it's going to

238
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,480
accept any HTTP connections from jump to

239
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,969
but it'll drop any other HTTP

240
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,170
connections from anywhere else so it's

241
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,480
likely that there's any

242
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,120
cheapy server running on this but only

243
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:16,540
jump to can access it so what do we do

244
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:22,110
about that well we can using the proxy

245
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:26,079
jump command in SSH we can actually do a

246
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:29,680
jump one and something neat about proxy

247
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,839
jump is you can specify subsequent jump

248
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,729
servers so you don't necessarily Errol

249
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,860
expand this so that it's all in one line

250
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,540
you don't necessarily need to have

251
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,279
multiple of these jump commands you can

252
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:44,560
just say I want to jump through jump one

253
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:48,430
and jump two into Brook at jump three

254
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,060
and it'll force you to log into each one

255
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:59,290
in a row and jump three always takes a

256
00:11:52,060 --> 00:12:02,800
extra minute here do you as always when

257
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,269
you start praying the demo gods and now

258
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,010
you're into jump three with one simple

259
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:12,670
command right but what about but what

260
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:19,209
about that HTTP server well we can

261
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:21,910
actually we can do something cool and

262
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,760
actually chain these commands so we can

263
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:28,410
use a capital - Aaron - capital J to

264
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:32,140
invoke the proxy jump and then we can

265
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:37,779
actually use a - capital L to port

266
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:39,550
forward our 8080 to jump three on a T so

267
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,500
this is a little more complicated but

268
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,260
we've already done all of this before so

269
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,930
we're using jump 1 as a proxy host to

270
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:50,560
jump into to get to jump to this allows

271
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:54,160
us to get into jump - now that we're SSA

272
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:59,680
Qing into jump - we can forward our port

273
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:03,310
8080 through jump to at jump 3 s port 80

274
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,250
okay and then we have to authenticate

275
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,839
like we did before

276
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:12,579
now our local port forward is setup so

277
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,800
we can come here and if we same thing we

278
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:17,680
did last time when we did the zero or

279
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,059
the local port forwarding stuff if we

280
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,959
curl ourselves on port

281
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:25,919
atat open this up that is getting

282
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,758
locally port forwarded to jump three

283
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,259
it's a little slow because you're

284
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,979
pivoting through you know a couple

285
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:35,619
different SSH connections but now we get

286
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,969
our jump host hosting insanity web page

287
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:40,539
okay can you believe this stuff works

288
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:43,089
this is crazy this is buddhu well we're

289
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:45,819
not quite done yet actually we have one

290
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,459
more tactic here that I'd like to teach

291
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:50,949
you and I saved this one for last

292
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:53,348
because a lot of people consider it the

293
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:56,589
the most useful one it's also the least

294
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:59,049
difficult to kind of comprehend and this

295
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:03,699
is basically setting up a dynamic port

296
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:06,579
forward or setting up port as a as as a

297
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:09,579
socks proxy okay so we use a capital D

298
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:11,498
to let SSH know so that we're gonna do

299
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:13,569
this we're gonna set up our proxy port

300
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:16,839
and then we're gonna set up our pivot

301
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:22,238
host okay and that's just our local port

302
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:24,819
on the initiating client that that is

303
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:26,799
going to be our proxy port so we can use

304
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,759
we can do the previous demonstration a

305
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:34,718
little bit differently

306
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:40,899
so if we SSH jump into through rook it's

307
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:45,609
jump one and then we dynamically port

308
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:51,959
forward all 8080 traffic through rook at

309
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:57,699
jump to okay then we authenticate oops

310
00:14:51,959 --> 00:15:00,218
typos we authenticate everything's

311
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:03,669
groovy we come down here now instead of

312
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:05,589
instead of having to curl localhost like

313
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,019
we did before we actually have our proxy

314
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:10,839
server set up so we can proxy like I

315
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:12,759
said it's a socks proxy so in curl we

316
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,589
use a minus X to denote what our socks

317
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,449
or what our proxy server is going to be

318
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,069
you can also use a you know a web

319
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,329
browser just point your web browser to

320
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:22,729
this port

321
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:26,599
but we can use a socks proxy we're gonna

322
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:30,529
proxy everything through this port setup

323
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,749
which as we saw in our previous command

324
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:36,410
that port is being forwarded through

325
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:42,980
jump to okay and then we're gonna do

326
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:45,679
HTTP jump three and there's that server

327
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,509
again there's that page again so if you

328
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,959
don't you don't believe me we can end

329
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:59,420
map directly we're gonna end map it

330
00:15:50,959 --> 00:16:02,738
right Oh No okay there we go we can end

331
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,969
map jump free directly to on port 80 and

332
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,429
show that it's still filtered so the

333
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,629
only reason we're able to get this page

334
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:13,730
is through that dynamic port forward

335
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:14,869
alright it's time to wrap up I know

336
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,670
there's a lot of other very interesting

337
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:18,699
talks going on at Kringle con that you

338
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,699
want to get to just a couple references

339
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:21,699
here

340
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,110
razmik has written an amazing ssh

341
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,089
telling tutorial with you know graphics

342
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,899
to help you understand the examples he's

343
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:35,089
using and a little more you know

344
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:38,119
in-depth use of the different flags and

345
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:40,129
then i also have started a pen test

346
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:42,110
process wiki it's a little slow moving

347
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:44,629
because i only remember to update every

348
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,079
once in a while but I do have a fully

349
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:51,199
fleshed-out SSH tunneling reference on

350
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,029
that so you can visit my get lab and go

351
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,769
to that wiki and and there's a pretty

352
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:59,389
great SSH pivoting reference I'd like to

353
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:01,639
thank you I'd like to thank again Santa
