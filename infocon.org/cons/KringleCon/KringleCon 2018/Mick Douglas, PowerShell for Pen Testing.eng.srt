1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
hi everyone I'm super happy to be here

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,369
teaching for you here at Kringle con and

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,050
we're gonna be going into some

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,400
powershell techniques that you can use

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:17,760
to help look for sensitive files or

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,070
files that contain interesting contents

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,640
so I got to say when I got this

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,160
invitation from Santa Claus okay it's a

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,320
no and frankly I'm really excited that

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,330
we're having the opportunity to all work

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,730
together and make Christmas and the

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,120
holiday seasons that much more secure

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,860
from the bad guys so as part of that

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,828
attendees of Kringle Con I'm looking at

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,010
you to figure out how to test the

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,980
security of everything whether it's the

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,379
North Pole weather control systems - the

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,328
elves workshop you have to go out and

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,360
make sure that the bad guys can't get a

20
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,910
toehold so what I want to talk with you

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,930
is a little bit about a passion project

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,629
of mine within PowerShell now when I'm

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,150
not here at Kringle con which by the way

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,070
it was oddly difficult to get to I mean

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,890
I know that it's a busy travel time but

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,919
holy cow it was rough one of the things

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,630
that I like to do is teach for sans and

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,810
I teach five oh four and five five five

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,548
I've got a whole bunch of upcoming

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,140
events coming so depending on which

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,650
class you're interested in feel free to

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,420
join in on the fun but one thing that

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,030
I'm here to talk to you about is

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,070
PowerShell I've been playing around with

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,470
our shell for years and years and quite

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,970
frankly I love it but I noticed that a

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,700
lot of people aren't using it to its

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,950
fullest potential and so if you're

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,619
struggling if you're doing a penetration

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,200
test you need to start asking yourself

41
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,840
some questions you know is there a task

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,990
that's being too difficult or maybe it's

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,790
too too time-consuming or what if the

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,490
task is slow a lot of times we're going

45
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,560
to be getting volumes of data and you

46
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,399
need better ways to sift through it or

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,430
it's just flat-out boring or now if

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,950
you've done this task multiple times

49
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,560
it's time friends for you to look into

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,000
power show that's right PowerShell it's

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,620
the gift that keeps on giving because

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,690
it's an API

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,519
that allows you to see all kinds of

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,680
interesting things that are going on

55
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,080
with the systems in the environments

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,420
that you're testing now PowerShell was

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,769
originally developed as a blue team tool

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,738
but there's plenty of use that the bad

59
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:35,099
guys have leveraged out of it and so you

60
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:38,579
should be too and one of the things that

61
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,450
really a lot of people struggle with is

62
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:45,299
showing the actual business impact of

63
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:49,679
what's going on with once the bad guys

64
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:51,840
get into the environment most times I

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,819
see a penetration test the reports are

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,530
actually pretty bad they say oh we were

67
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,048
able to become administrator on this

68
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,769
local system or domain administrator and

69
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:03,659
to that I say so what what you need to

70
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,010
do is start showing business impact and

71
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,929
one of the things that you can do to

72
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,030
show business impact is that you

73
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,700
actually get your hands on interesting

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,280
files files the contain data for

75
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,099
instance maybe the good boys and girls

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,980
list that Santa keeps or the naughty

77
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,988
kids list so I want to share with you a

78
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,319
way that you can quickly find the files

79
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,519
that you need across the enterprise

80
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,888
so one thing that you can look for is

81
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,250
use the windows search index the windows

82
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,859
search engine index is amazing and

83
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,069
that's what we're putting the for the

84
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,260
win here it's something that not enough

85
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,879
defenders think about I have seen some

86
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,948
forensics people playing with it at the

87
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,918
touch but not as much as I would have

88
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,079
liked and I almost never see penetration

89
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,190
testers use it which is why I'm talking

90
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,769
to you today about this the most

91
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,349
interesting thing from a penetration

92
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,959
testing standpoint about the windows

93
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:08,250
search index is that it's enabled by

94
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,949
default this means that most in fact the

95
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,900
ultra majority of systems are going to

96
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,540
have the windows search index up and

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,250
running and this has a really

98
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:23,340
interesting effect because it now we can

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,580
search by file contents not just file

100
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,510
names and the other thing that you need

101
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,390
to understand is

102
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,180
it's lightning fast the search index is

103
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:37,229
a database that contains the content

104
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,990
that we need to search for and that's it

105
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,810
so we no longer have to actually crawl

106
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,980
through the file system a file at a time

107
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,980
which can cause high input output that

108
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,630
high i/o can be detected because a lot

109
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,480
of times people now are looking for

110
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,280
ransomware and unfortunately if you

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,290
don't use this technique when you're

112
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,380
rifling through the file system or maybe

113
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,990
a network share you're going to look a

114
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:08,460
lot like a ransomware or some other odd

115
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:12,090
behavior I've almost never ever had

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,739
anybody catch me using the technique

117
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,590
that I'm about to show you because this

118
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,490
looks like a normal user interacting

119
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,650
with the regular windows search index

120
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,010
which you would normally interact with

121
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,270
from your windows file explorer but

122
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,719
we're going to be doing it all from the

123
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:33,180
command line within powershell the way

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,760
we're going to do this is by using a

125
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,910
lesser-known powershell commandlets

126
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,719
called get indexed item a little bit in

127
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,630
the talk later

128
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,170
I'll give you a link that you can use to

129
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,020
get this but the thing that's so cool

130
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:53,100
about this is this will make the queries

131
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,440
for you and it actually exposes some

132
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,990
functions of the windows search index

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,510
API that you wouldn't even have

134
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,110
available to you if you were using the

135
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:08,030
Windows File Explorer so I can't stress

136
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,380
enough that you need to use this and I

137
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,859
stand by the second bullet point it's

138
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,110
very very easy to use we're now going to

139
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,750
dive into a demo of how to use the gun

140
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,420
in the next item and you'll be shocked

141
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:31,430
at just how similar to other powershell

142
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:34,680
scripts it is okay we're now in a on my

143
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,860
normal teaching system and you'll see

144
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,190
here that i have the get indexed item

145
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:44,040
ps1 in order to load this i have to

146
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:49,020
either allow execution of PowerShell

147
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,840
code and right now my execution policy

148
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,650
is restricted so to bypass that I'm just

149
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:02,219
going to use the classic bypass mode so

150
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:05,700
PowerShell EP bypass and now a new power

151
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,070
shell prompt starts up and if I get my

152
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,710
execution restriction policies now

153
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,620
you'll see that I'm in bypass mode once

154
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:21,570
I'm in bypass now what I can do is

155
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:24,270
import module get indexed item and once

156
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:29,930
you've imported the module correctly you

157
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:33,390
won't see any sort of indicators that it

158
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,570
loaded correctly or not this is a case

159
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:39,120
of where no news is good news and so now

160
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:43,710
to run this command let all you simply

161
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,169
do is get indexed item like so and then

162
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,349
you specify your filter conditions what

163
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:52,349
you're looking for and the filter

164
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,669
notation is well documented in inside

165
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,160
the script so once you download it

166
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,990
you'll learn all the filter syntax but

167
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,840
for the purposes of this I'm going to

168
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,910
show you a few very relatively simple

169
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,239
use cases so that you can get up in the

170
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:11,460
morning with that so if I wanted to see

171
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:14,790
any file that is listed that contains a

172
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,159
specific string I would do something

173
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,710
along these lines now let's say I'm

174
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:26,760
looking for my files where my wife is

175
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:29,130
mentioned so now I have a query and some

176
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,919
of you may say this looks a little like

177
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,719
sequel if that's a deliberate choice on

178
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,150
the developer who created this script

179
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,969
and I find this to be very very simple

180
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,890
to interact with now all I need to do is

181
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:45,330
hit enter and I just pull up all the

182
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:48,810
files where she's inside her name is

183
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:52,020
actually inside the file and what's

184
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,660
crazy is just how fast this is so

185
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,640
this machine I use for teaching sans

186
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,469
events and when I run this command

187
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,449
you'll see that I have many many files

188
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,320
that have something to do with sands and

189
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:08,010
believe it or not the thing that's

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,500
actually slowing things down is the rate

191
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:14,340
at which the power shell prompt can

192
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,210
display the text out if I was writing to

193
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,340
a file

194
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,820
it'd actually be writing we'd probably

195
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:24,180
already be done now so I'm just gonna

196
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,420
hit ctrl C to end this as you can see

197
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:32,969
you may get a whole lot of data out of

198
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:36,140
this so I want to hop back to my slide

199
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,730
deck and explain some things about this

200
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,949
so the first thing that I would

201
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,930
encourage you to use to make this a

202
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:46,460
little more enjoyable and a little more

203
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,979
fruitful for you is to use the - path

204
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:53,700
option to restrict your search so going

205
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,780
back to this query that was problematic

206
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:06,410
because it was so lengthy if I add half

207
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:09,870
and then I put C users Nick D downloads

208
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,959
you'll see that I get a much smaller set

209
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,440
of files because I'm only restricting to

210
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:20,100
one particular path the next bit of

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:24,690
advice I would give you is make use of

212
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,820
the pipeline PowerShell really the whole

213
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,160
power of it is that it works somewhat

214
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,200
like UNIX and frankly I'm a longtime

215
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,920
UNIX admin and this is what has drawn me

216
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,150
to PowerShell is the concept of pipeline

217
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,490
you should look into using things like

218
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,800
select select string and where objects

219
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,770
these commandlets will dramatically

220
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,790
improve the performance and targeting

221
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:51,540
that you can get so for instance let's

222
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:56,490
go back up to this command and let's say

223
00:10:51,540 --> 00:11:00,630
I wanted to restrict my findings to only

224
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:04,020
include things like power point objects

225
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,370
or like PowerPoint documents so what I

226
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,740
would do

227
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:16,260
select name and then pipe it into select

228
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:19,830
string and then what I would do is have

229
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:24,810
my pattern be pptx because that's the

230
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:27,750
extension for a for a PowerPoint deck

231
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,420
and here right away we can see these are

232
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,270
the objects that we have within the

233
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,199
Downloads directory so it's really

234
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:39,650
really easy and unbelievably fast so

235
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,529
what I would encourage you guys to do is

236
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:45,209
go out there start playing for it they

237
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,880
didn't use this now things to look

238
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,700
forward I love to look for user names

239
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,620
and one thing that I would encourage you

240
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:57,750
to do is look for the raw string

241
00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:00,839
username or user names and also look for

242
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,660
the strings of the actual user names

243
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,730
that you're able to enumerate from your

244
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,620
machines that you're on this will allow

245
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,870
you to very quickly and easily find

246
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,610
other user names because often times

247
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,610
they're grouped and it's a very powerful

248
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,950
technique also look for passwords look

249
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,800
for the string password look for the

250
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,480
actual raw string of the password that

251
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,699
you've been able to steal or crack

252
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,670
because when you find one password

253
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,490
you're usually going to find others

254
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,529
please start looking for API keys

255
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,930
developers seem to have not yet gotten a

256
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:36,540
message that if you steal the API key

257
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,560
you can take over the web application so

258
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,779
please find them before the bad guys do

259
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,189
also look for configuration files once

260
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,320
you have a configuration file those

261
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,880
usually point to other systems and the

262
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,959
thing that I love about this technique

263
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,900
using this to enumerate config files I

264
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,270
don't have to send packets downrange

265
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,180
it's a very economical way from a

266
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:02,550
network standpoint to enumerate the

267
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,339
environment which is awesome because

268
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:08,579
that makes it very hard for defenders to

269
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:11,220
type to catch it so use your config

270
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,080
files to enumerate your environments and

271
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,990
finally look for interesting terms for

272
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,850
your client you know because we're here

273
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,260
at Kringle con start looking for the

274
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,090
naughty boys and girls list

275
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,880
start looking for things like who's

276
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:26,550
getting lumps of coal so you'll be able

277
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,920
to find interesting terms for your

278
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,729
client based off of the reconnaissance

279
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,640
that you've been doing so try it out

280
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,670
yourself I've made a tiny URL for you to

281
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,770
go ahead and download and get this very

282
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,770
helpful script what I would encourage

283
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,569
you to do is take it play with it and

284
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,510
see how you like it I'm sure you will

285
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:53,010
though and the version that I've linked

286
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:55,350
to here is from the empire project some

287
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,319
of you may have known it as PowerShell

288
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,300
Empire it is since grown to include some

289
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,620
Python modules so it's now simply called

290
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:07,380
the Empire project this is a version

291
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,150
that came from a tech met article and a

292
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,330
series of blog postings that were made

293
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:14,430
years ago and it's really cool that this

294
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,950
is getting folded into this project

295
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,530
unfortunately I don't know many people

296
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,250
who are using it so please play with

297
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:24,990
this component I'm sure you'll dig it

298
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,670
also I would encourage you to read the

299
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,880
code I know that that sounds rather

300
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,770
elitist but there's many features and

301
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,230
functions that this script has that we

302
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,510
simply don't have time to go over in our

303
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,850
limited time together what I've shown

304
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,460
you is a lot to get you started but

305
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,520
believe me this goes way deeper than

306
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,620
what I have time and then also tests and

307
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,890
non production even though this is

308
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,200
lightning fast I have seen EDR that

309
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,720
could catch this if you're trying to fly

310
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,410
below the radar there's some evasion

311
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,660
techniques that you're gonna need to use

312
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,880
so test it in your non production

313
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,180
environment that replicates prod as

314
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,350
closely as possible then finally test

315
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:15,239
your UNC's I would really consider that

316
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:17,490
we're required the usage of - path when

317
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,260
you're doing network analysis and the

318
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,440
reason why is when you're doing network

319
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,900
shares or doing this sort of discovery

320
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,230
on a network is that you're going to

321
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:31,050
find volumes of data just way too much

322
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,710
so by restricting things down with path

323
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:37,290
you're going to have a much better time

324
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,450
so that kind of ends our time together I

325
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,099
hope that you have a whole lot of luck

326
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,200
securing the north pole we're all

327
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,320
counting on it because quite frankly

328
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:50,460
