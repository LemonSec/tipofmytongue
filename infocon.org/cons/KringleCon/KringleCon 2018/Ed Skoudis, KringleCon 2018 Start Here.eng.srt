last 15 years Santa Claus has given us

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,059
some deep insights into what's happening

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,119
during the holiday season and especially

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,409
at the North Pole every year Santa

41
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,200
communicates with me

42
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,210
I hear him and he tells me things about

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,220
what's going on at the North Pole and

44
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,929
some of his concerns and worries and

45
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,360
things associated with the holiday

46
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,659
season Santa does reach out to me and he

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,799
tells me about the background of what's

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,130
happening at the North Pole and

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,720
especially how various bad guys are

50
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,149
trying to hack into the North Pole

51
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,360
infrastructure I am so thankful that

52
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,420
Santa shares this stuff with us so that

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,850
we can put his stories together and

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,790
present them to you every year as part

55
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,489

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,900

64
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:27,510
conference set at the North Pole but

65
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,430
make no mistake about it this is a

66
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,899
holiday hack challenge and Santa Claus

67
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,060

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,189
want you to answer and you'll see those

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,650

70
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,530
and watch some talks so thank you Santa

of the stories and ideas from the North

74
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,730
Pole now an important concept to

75
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,980
remember is to play holiday hack

76
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,828
challenge 2018 that's this year's

77
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,268
challenge you do not need to have played

78
00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:00,120
any holiday hack challenges in the past

79
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,760
you're starting fresh you can start from

80
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,680
here and move forward you don't have to

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,239
go to the holiday hack challenges of the

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,849
past you do not need to do this at all

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,939
however I'd like to give you a little

84
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:14,638
bit of context of why Kringle Khanna

85
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,340
exists and to understand why Santa Claus

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,859
wanted a hosts Kringle Khan we need to

87
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,930
go back through the last three holiday

88
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,780
hack challenges I'd like to very briefly

89
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,120
give you a summary of each of the three

90
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,859
holiday hack challenges of the past now

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,720
you don't have to have worked on these

92
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:34,169
how to hack challenges to do great in

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,699
holiday hack challenge 2018 but they are

94
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,189
useful knowledge to understand how we

95
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,189
got here the first one of the last three

96
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,189
years was how to hat challenge 2015 we

97
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:46,530
called it Nome in your home in this

98
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:49,138
holiday hack challenge there was a there

99
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,790
was a certain toy that the retail stores

100
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,370
were selling for Christmas it was called

101
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,750
Nome in your home and the idea was it

102
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,579
was this little doll that you could get

103
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,859
and you could plug it into the wall and

104
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,859
it would start playing 8-bit holiday

105
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,109
music and there were two kids Jessica

106
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,609
and Joshua and their dad bought them one

107
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,199
of these little gnome in your homes and

108
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,060
they put it in their house they're

109
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,919
actually over two million houses that

110
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,299
had a gnome in your home back in the

111
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,269
2015 challenge

112
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,190
anyway Jessica and Joshua were analyzing

113
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,810
their little gnome in the home and they

114
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,089
noticed something weird there was a

115
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,219
stream of wireless packets that was

116
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,960
coming off of the device and they

117
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,760
snipped open their gnome in the home and

118
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,609
they pulled out a little electronic

119
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,889
circuit from it

120
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,889
a little bored on it and they extracted

121
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,569
the firmware extracted the firmware from

122
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,060
the gnome in their home and then they

123
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:40,990
did some analysis of it so you were able

124
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,780
to in 2015 to go into their neighborhood

125
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,030
and explore you were able to find

126
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,979
Jessica and Joshua you're able to get a

127
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,900
packet capture as well as the firmware

128
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:51,310
and start analyzing it and as you

129
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,830
analyze this you had to figure out what

130
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,840
the nefarious plot was and it turns out

131
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:00,068
that the company that sold the gnomes

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,020
was called Atmos corporation Etienne AAS

133
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:05,650
and what his corporation was trying to

134
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,508
do was to sell these gnomes far across

135
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,120
the land and then they were taking

136
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,129
pictures and parents were encouraged to

137
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,110
move the gnomes around in their house so

138
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:16,629
that every day they'd get a picture of a

139
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,060
different place then Atmos Corporation

140
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:22,539
was going to take all these pictures and

141
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,800
do crowd-sourced burglary you see the

142
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,139
gnomes would take these pictures and

143
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,629
send them up to five super gnomes these

144
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,889
are five gnomes to rule them all and

145
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,259
these super gnomes are all on different

146
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:34,090
continents anyway you would have to hack

147
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,370
into the super gnomes pull information

148
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,560
from them and try to determine who was

149
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,599
the evil mastermind behind Atmos

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,060
corporation and as you analyzed it you

151
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:48,669
would determine that it was cindy-lou

152
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,650
who aged 62 you see cindy-lou who that

153
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,180
little girl who saw the BRIT the Grinch

154
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,789
stealing her Christmas tree

155
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,949
she was so scarred by that occurrence

156
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:59,318
that she decided that some day she was

157
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,150
gonna grow up and do what the Grinch

158
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,969
tried to do but she was gonna do it

159
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,710
right she was gonna steal all the

160
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:08,199
Christmas presents on Christmas Eve by

161
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,049
crowdsourcing the burglary so you had to

162
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,940
help in 2015 bring cindy-lou who to

163
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,620
justice that was 2015 we move forward a

164
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,139
2016 holiday hack challenge this one we

165
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,180
called Santa's business card we also had

166
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:24,699
Jessica and Joshua in this one as well

167
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,469
and they woke up one Christmas Eve very

168
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,839
late at night and they heard Santa's

169
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:32,110
sled land on their roof they could hear

170
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,819
the footprints of the reindeer they can

171
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,500
also hear Santa sliding down their

172
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,020
chimney and then they kind of creeped

173
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,270
out their their bedroom and they go

174
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,590
downstairs now they don't see Santa but

175
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,570
just before they get there that he

176
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,090
delivering the presents but then

177
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,310
suddenly they hear this sound of a

178
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,989
struggle in a fight and they hear the

179
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,880
sound of somebody cracking a Christmas

180
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,880
tree over Santa's head and then they

181
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,090
drag Santa away and then Jessica and

182
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,890
Joshua go out and look at their living

183
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,570
room and their Christmas tree is broken

184
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,330
there's Christmas tree needles all over

185
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,810
the place and Santa's bag is left there

186
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,550
but Santa's been kidnapped you see now

187
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,650
they look in Santa's bag and when you go

188
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,660
into the 2016 holiday hack challenge you

189
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,460
can go in and see Santa's bag is there

190
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,920
you can walk right into the world and

191
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,739
when you reach into Santa's bag or go

192
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,060
into Santa's bag oh you're teleported

193
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,640
and now you're at the North Pole

194
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,100
because you see Santa's bag is a

195
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,719
teleportation device Santa doesn't

196
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,060
actually put all the toys in the bag and

197
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,670
then move the bag round but instead the

198
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,410
bag is a portal back into the North Pole

199
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,550
so he just carries the bag around and

200
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,860
then he can reach into the bag and pull

201
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,700
out the presents it all makes sense now

202
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,820
yes

203
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,590
so you go into the bag and then boom you

204
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,180
pop out at the North Pole you start

205
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,409
exploring the North Pole you see all

206
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,420
kinds of interesting things there and

207
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,340
you start talking with the elves but as

208
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,620
you work your way into it you find that

209
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,390
there is a train a big blue train and

210
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,520
there's computer controls for the Train

211
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,760
and you have to hack the Train and when

212
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,680
you do it activates the time-traveling

213
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,120
functionality of the Train and whoosh

214
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,170
the Train travels back to 1978 and then

215
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,600
you can get off the train and start

216
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,970
walking around the music changes the hue

217
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,160
changes the elves start talking about

218
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,350
different things and when you work your

219
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,990
way through the 1978 part of the game

220
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,120
you find Santa their Santa has been

221
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,270
imprisoned in the dungeon for errant

222
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,910
reindeer so you have to take Santa and

223
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,349
you bring him back to 2016

224
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,420
you still got to find out who the bad

225
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,770
guy is so you start exploring around

226
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,000
looking to see who the bad guy is and

227
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,030
ultimately your hack your way into

228
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,140
various things and you discover that the

229
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:45,280
bad guy is Doctor Who and doctor who had

230
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,050
kidnapped Santa took him back to 1978 so

231
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,689
that he could suppress the release of

232
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,949
the Star Wars Holiday Special

233
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,690
doctor who thought that was such a

234
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,170
blight on the universe that he wanted to

235
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,600
rub it out and he

236
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,920
kneaded Santa's magic to do that so you

237
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,899
could have worked your way through that

238
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,819
whole challenge and ultimately saved

239
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,230
Christmas by restoring Santa Claus after

240
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,970
he had been kidnapped

241
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,860
so that's Santa's business card the

242
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,660
whole thing starts with the business

243
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,209
card because that's all that's left

244
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,949
among all of the needles that are

245
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,920
dropped from the tree right next to

246
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:18,199
Santa's bag is that Santa's business

247
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,880
card so you got to save Christmas in

248
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:26,599
2016 in 2017 the holiday hack challenge

249
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,730
opens up with giant snowballs pouring

250
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,170
down the mountain of the North Pole and

251
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,120
they're crushing things they're like

252
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,130
crushing elves and crushing houses that

253
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,709
is terrible you got to figure out who is

254
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,320
throwing down the snowballs and why and

255
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,060
as you work your way through this you

256
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,339
discover there's a thing called the

257
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,880
great book and the great book is a

258
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:50,170
history of the elves but it's not just

259
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,930
of the elves themselves the elves are

260
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,729
actually a faction of the munchkins of

261
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,769
Oz you see the great book is this

262
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,720
wonderful book that was shredded by an

263
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,579
interdimensional tornado and you have to

264
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,730
fetch different pages of this book and

265
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:08,449
one of the pages describes the united

266
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,769
people of the munchkins of Oz but it

267
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,620
also has another page it talks about the

268
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:15,350
Great Schism and that's where the

269
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,390
munchkins and the elves were somehow put

270
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,920
against each other now we've lost a

271
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,630
history why the munchkins and the elves

272
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,519
were actually hating each other

273
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,829
they're from the original same species

274
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,930
but they split up during the Great

275
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:30,229
Schism and it was almost a civil war in

276
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,910
Oz but The Wizard of Oz contacted Santa

277
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,430
Claus and said hey I got a problem here

278
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,589
in Santa said we'll wait a second look

279
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,410
I'm setting up a toy delivery operation

280
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,420
up here at the North Pole so maybe your

281
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,969
problem can help solve my problem why

282
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,769
don't you send me the elves and I'll use

283
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,480
them to help you know deliver all the

284
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:50,149
toys and then you keep the munchkins

285
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,310
they're in Oz and we'll have peace The

286
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,630
Wizard of Oz liked this idea from his

287
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,819
good friend Santa Claus anyone even

288
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,209
further he said look the scientists of

289
00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:01,639
Oz have created flying monkeys as well

290
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:04,099
as flying reindeer why don't you take

291
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,529
the flying reindeer with the elf so you

292
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,610
can go up to the North Pole and they can

293
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,079
both help you as

294
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,079
you do your stuff and this works great

295
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:16,219
for centuries this Great Schism the

296
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,689
splitting of the peoples of us but then

297
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,829
suddenly these snowballs start falling

298
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,279
down you got to figure out who's behind

299
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,630
it

300
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,399
as you hack your way into things you

301
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,890
ultimately discover that who's throwing

302
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,380
the snowballs it's the abominable snow

303
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,449
monster but the snow monster himself is

304
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,160
under a spell he's not doing this of his

305
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,440
own volition instead as you hacked

306
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,390
through more things you discover you do

307
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,680
true attribution and you find out that

308
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,930
it was ultimately Glinda the so-called

309
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,510
good witch of Oz that's why we call it

310
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,089
winter the untold story of the elves of

311
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,089
the North Pole Glinda the Good Witch has

312
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,130
cast a spell on the abominable snow

313
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,529
monster so that while he's mesmerized

314
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,910
he's throwing these giant snowballs down

315
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:58,730
the mountain of the North Pole

316
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,010
why did good to do this she did it

317
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,730
because she wanted to start a war

318
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,589
between the elves and the munchkins she

319
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,050
was a war profiteer she wanted to sell

320
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:10,670
her magic in her spells to both sides so

321
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,250
she can make a ton of money so that's

322
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,510
what happened in 2017 all right so where

323
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,120
are we going with this well that brings

324
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,010
us to this year Santa Claus looked at

325
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,220
the last three years and said wait a

326
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,670
second folks in 2015 we had cindy-lou

327
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,010
who trying to destroy Christmas in 2016

328
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,290
doctor who kidnapped me and who's trying

329
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,420
to destroy the holiday season and in

330
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,459
2017 Glinda the Good Witch is trying to

331
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,000
break apart the North Pole with giant

332
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:39,920
snowballs and incite a massive war Santa

333
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,079
Claus said this has got to stop

334
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,540
so what Santa did is he came up with the

335
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,849
idea of hosting a conference at the

336
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,790
North Pole a conference for information

337
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,829
security and hackers alike information

338
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,469
security personnel and hackers joining

339
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:57,109
together working together building our

340
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:00,800
skills so that we can help keep the

341
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,740
world and the holiday season safe from

342
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,420
evil holiday supervillains that's the

343
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,800
whole idea of Kringle cot we're gonna

344
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,649
get a whole bunch of people together and

345
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,550
try to prevent some sort of holiday

346
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,949
disaster

347
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,800
that's why Kringle kahn exists and I'm

348
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:17,870

398
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,199
how entire classrooms of students at the

399
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,180
junior high level or the high school

400
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,590
level or college students a whole class

401
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,209
of twenty or thirty students will work

402
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,910

those tweets of the photos and such and

411
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,640
usually I release some sort of year-end

412
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,500
thing of people working on the holiday

413
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,000
hack so you can chat with your fellow

414
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,980
attendees you can work as teams you can

415
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,630
have some fun also Santa has issues

416
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,279
a series of questions I mean this is

417
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,740
what makes it the holiday hat there's

418
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,959
about 10 questions that Sansa asks and

419
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,180
as you answer those questions you will

420
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,739
build your skills and you'll see some

421
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,510
fun and interesting things happening now

422
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,910
the questions start out in a very

423
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,920
straightforward fashion and they build

424
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,680
over time and they get more and more

425
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,740
complex and difficult oh you can hear in

426
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,269
the background now my office is actually

427
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,769
striking the top of the hour so we're

428
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,620
gonna go ahead and let that play while I

429
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:08,310
continue to speak you can also explore

430
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,660
Santa's castle and in Santa's castle in

431
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,579
addition to having all kinds of

432
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,569
interesting music and sounds that play

433
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:15,660
on their own

434
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,820
not unlike my office we have Big Bend

435
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,740
toning right now in addition to that

436
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,899
there's also a bunch of fun things for

437
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,610
you to explore in the castle as you

438
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,410
click on things in the castle they'll

439
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,870
open up and you can do things and

440
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,290
interact with them another really big

441
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,750
hint for you is that Santa's elves

442
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:36,870
provide hints but you first need to sir

443
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,490
solve some terminal challenges so the

444
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,380
concept here is you go up to a terminal

445
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,720
challenge it's just a simple little

446
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,000
cranberry pie terminal wherever you see

447
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,860
a little cranberry pie on a terminal

448
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,199
click on that thing it'll pop you right

449
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,730
into a command line and then you have to

450
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,319
solve some challenges there that the

451
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,639
cranberry pie terminal challenges are

452
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:55,709
designed to be fairly straightforward

453
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,260
you kind of have to hack your way out of

454
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:01,319
something there and then the associated

455
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,790
elf will give you some hints now another

456
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,500
thing in addition to seeing the elves

457
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,510
throughout the castle you'll also see

458
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,209
the toy soldiers the toy soldiers are

459
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,369
kind of Santa's security force but I got

460
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,439
to tell you the toy soldiers just aren't

461
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,708
very friendly in fact some of them are

462
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,040
downright mean so you know try to stay

463
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,140
away from those toy soldiers yeah and it

464
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,079
may sometimes seem to get even meaner as

465
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,839
time goes on gosh I really hope we have

466
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,909

467
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,559
Kringle calm this year I mean I hope I

468
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,530
hope nothing goes wrong because that

469
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,000
would be that would be bad yeah and if

470
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,460
it does go wrong gosh I hope our

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,169
attendees will be able to help us take

472
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,120
care of all that oh and by the way we

473
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,620
have a vendor booth - it has t-shirts

474
