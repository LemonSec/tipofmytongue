1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
hello and welcome to Kringle Con this is

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,710
Jack Daniel and we're here as Santa has

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,110
invited us to work together to avoid

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,330
being hacked save Santa save Christmas

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,660
make the world a happier place I want to

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,850
talk about community building and how we

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,490
can work together to save Christmas and

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,880
our jobs and all sorts of other things

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,519
so I am Jack I one of the people that

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,250
makes besides what it is and also work

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,850
at tenable and doing a lot of community

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,210
building for a very long time it's

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,399
really things really made my career but

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,840
also my personal life a lot richer from

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,289
the folks that I've met and interacted

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,309
with through the decades let's start out

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,230
with you know what do we mean by

18
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,360
community let's let's go to the boring

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,129
dictionary definitions you know a group

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,890
of people living in the same place and

21
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,780
not so much us but a feeling of

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,090
fellowship with others as a result of

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,969
sharing common attitudes interests and

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,650
goals that's closer to it we don't

25
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,720
always have the exact same attitudes

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,600
interests and goals but in the hacker

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,400
community we share information that's

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,320
how we learn things we play with things

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,680
we break things we fix things and then

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,780
we learn the lessons and share and we

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,189
all advance from there so why why why go

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,159
to the effort of building community

33
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:30,619
what's you know what do we get from this

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,960
activity that that's good for us well

35
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:36,570
quickly you know we share ideas it's how

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,360
we learn as I said it's how we grow

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,798
there's no better way to learn something

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,670
than to try to teach it to somebody else

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,649
share ideas we spark conversations as we

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,409
have those conversations we connect we

41
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,670
know who is doing what cool stuff we

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,020
know if there's somebody that might be

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,450
able to give us a hand or someone that

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,899
we can give a hand to especially as that

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,270
comes to advancing our careers these

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,860
things all work together the the bad

47
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,979
guys are working together we should work

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,719
together too now there are some

49
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,280
challenges to building community but

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,929
they can overcome them we have to

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,120
address them before we can really dig

52
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,580
into

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,140
the world better the first one is as

54
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,360
many of you probably noticed there isn't

55
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,220
just one community there are a lot of

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,629
communities I like to think of it more

57
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:26,390
as anthropological tribes and nations

58
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:29,120
and clams down to family units but

59
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,010
unlike that sort of model we get to be

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,780
in multiples we can choose what

61
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,310
communities maybe you're hardcore

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,159
cryptography but you also like lock

63
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,489
sport perhaps your day job is policy and

64
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:46,399
compliance but you really enjoy reverse

65
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:48,620
engineering malware but the the PCI

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,190
things pay you better so we have a bunch

67
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,390
of different categories of people that

68
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,629
that come together and we have some

69
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,298
common interests and you know these

70
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:01,220
these sometimes divide us but what

71
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,750
really works well is getting together so

72
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,200
those of us who call ourselves hackers

73
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,970
there are a lot of people who still

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,828
identify hacker is bad mainstream media

75
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,590
has really done a number to us but a lot

76
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,720
of us are proud to wear that label a lot

77
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,340
of us also are you know InfoSec

78
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,260
professionals but many are hobbyists

79
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,139
some of some like me work and vendor

80
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,819
space as well as in the community and

81
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,739
they're more and more of us who straddle

82
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,750
this divide you know that it used to be

83
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,940
that not many people went to both Def

84
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,489
Con and RSA but it's it's as the

85
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,169
industry is matured I don't wanna say

86
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,700
we've matured that would be boring but

87
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:37,519
as the industry is matured more of us

88
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,040
cross this divide but we also have the

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,079
the stratification between the trench

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,530
level warriors and the various strata of

91
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,510
management and executives but we are

92
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,329
best when we bridge these divides and

93
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,149
these are opportunities to learn it's

94
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:57,440
opportunities to understand as a manager

95
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,449
executive who is actually hands on

96
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,699
keyboard fighting the bad guys and the

97
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:05,090
other way around what what is it that is

98
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,560
driving your organization when you're in

99
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,540
the trenches so you understand how to

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,879
move forward and if you can share these

101
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:15,230
ideas in community organizations large

102
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,930
and small we all are better off another

103
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,409
challenge in building community is this

104
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,060
one we're pretty much all overworked and

105
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,020
if you're trying to build a community or

106
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,680
strength in your local community it take

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,590
some work someone's got to do the work

108
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,180
it doesn't happen magically sometimes a

109
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,669
little bit of coordination goes a long

110
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,289
way and sometimes it takes a lot more

111
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:41,370
coordination like putting on Kringle

112
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:42,810
Khan that took a lot of effort and when

113
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,000
we talk about community a lot of this

114
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,490
stuff is is all volunteer work and of

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,520
course the the challenge of volunteer

116
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,259
work as Gandhi famously said the problem

117
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:58,799
with altruism is there's nothing in it

118
00:04:52,259 --> 00:05:00,479
for me the reality is that we get a lot

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
back out of volunteerism there been a

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,280
couple of recent studies and things that

121
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,470
have shown real value in in this you

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,008
know but most of us get into doing these

123
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,509
sort of things by learning something and

124
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,690
wanting to share you know that's that

125
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,099
was my path into community I landed as

126
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,860
an IT admin and had to deal with

127
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:21,060
security issues back in the 90s didn't

128
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,879
know where to turn joined some user

129
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,349
groups learned from people then I had

130
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,990
some problems that managed to fix on my

131
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:30,120
own so I shared what I have learned and

132
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,159
that has been a story I've heard over

133
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,750
and over and over again we've learned

134
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,419
from the community and it's our turn to

135
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,270
give back so there actually is a lot you

136
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:42,180
feel great doing it it is good for you

137
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:47,639
personally and professionally and so

138
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:49,740
it's not really for me so there are some

139
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,580
secrets to building community and some

140
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,180
obvious things dig into this so I can

141
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,490
describe this in six words Mike my

142
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:04,440
secrets to a building community in six

143
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:07,020
words the first three give a darn you

144
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,409
are free to substitute strong hunger

145
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,299
words as appropriate but you have to

146
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,190
actually care about it this is true

147
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,370
whether you're building community for

148
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,569
purely goodwill purposes if you're just

149
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,590
trying to strengthen your local

150
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,569
community if you're trying to bring

151
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,568
people together for whatever reason or

152
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,520
if you're doing it in a commercial

153
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,960
setting if you're if you're working with

154
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,639
the community manager in your

155
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:35,479
corporation or your job

156
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:38,180
people have to care if you're interested

157
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:41,479
in things just for financial gain or for

158
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,689
personal pride or ego people will see

159
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,099
that it's not about giving community so

160
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,590
we have to have people that really care

161
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:51,110
luckily in the hacker community it is a

162
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,539
passionate group it is is a good bunch

163
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,180
of people you find people that are

164
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,340
like-minded work with them that can

165
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,400
sometimes be difficult because we all

166
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,039
you may have noticed a lot of us and a

167
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,799
hacker crowd have some opinions and hey

168
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:08,509
they don't always line up but it's a

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,659
good exercise in learning how to work

170
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:15,469
with people for a greater good or common

171
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:17,270
good so the first part as I said is give

172
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:21,379
a darn or whatever word you'd like to

173
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:24,020
use moving beyond that though this is

174
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:25,789
the part that is important you need to

175
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,109
give a voice to the people in the

176
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,080
community that you're building or

177
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,180
maintaining you need to give them a

178
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,339
platform to show what they know share

179
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,139
what they've learned to be heard about

180
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:40,819
the direction that your community is

181
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:42,740
going and here's the key part you have

182
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,029
to listen to them you have to respond

183
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,430
you have to go in the direction of the

184
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:49,339
community wants you to go that's why you

185
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,139
know at every event you go to we all beg

186
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,909
you to fill out those feedback forms so

187
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,120
we know how you know which speakers were

188
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:59,409
good what went well what didn't we have

189
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,879
to we have to share what we've learned

190
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,319
and we have to move forward as a

191
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,750
community we have to give people a voice

192
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,639
let them be heard and we have to listen

193
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,610
to them one of the things that I do both

194
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,259
for besides in for my work is I spend a

195
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,089
lot of time talking to people and that's

196
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,580
insignificant what I spend a lot of time

197
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:21,949
doing is even more time doing is

198
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,539
listening to people taking that

199
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,939
information back wherever it belongs

200
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:27,050
whether it's to a specific event or

201
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,419
whether it's specific community are

202
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,680
trying to start an initiative or you

203
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,909
know in the corporate setting maybe it's

204
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,490
going back to your product management

205
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:36,140
team or your support team or your

206
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,180
marketing team to make sure that the

207
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,269
messages are heard in the community

208
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,789
since it is to make sure that your group

209
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:46,880
whatever it is that you're doing

210
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,790
is actually doing what the people won't

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,500
want what your community needs and wants

212
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,860
we have to listen to that voice give

213
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,160
people the opportunity to be heard and

214
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,610
grow and understand that if you're if

215
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,069
you let things go on their own a little

216
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,520
bit of shepherding it becomes a very

217
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,410
powerful community

218
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,960
it grows people's careers advanced

219
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,219
something that I've seen in the decades

220
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,950
of doing this it's really amazing to

221
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,720
watch people come into small groups be

222
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,660
very timid be welcomed into the group

223
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,890
and then discover that they've got there

224
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,449
other people that have their weird

225
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,830
interest and it turns out it's not so

226
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,080
weird they're you know they're old

227
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,360
tracks at Def Con or their entire

228
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,100
courses at sans or their b-sides events

229
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,840
where there's a lot of focus on whatever

230
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,900
your interest is whether it's data

231
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,850
science or authentication or you know

232
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,790
classic red team or physical pin test

233
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,700
you know I've seen seeing people hacking

234
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,310
elevators you find those people you find

235
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,130
your people you work together you have a

236
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,290
sense of friendship Accra Madhuri in

237
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,680
many cases people end up you know as

238
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,630
chosen family and it all comes from

239
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,489
giving people of an opportunity to talk

240
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:04,100
and listening to that and working

241
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:07,660
together as a team and so that's my

242
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,700
short little spiel on building community

243
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,250
it's a matter of giving people a voice

244
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,700
and listening to it it's a matter of

245
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,440
playing Shepherd when you need to and

246
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,230
guiding people through and letting the

247
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,600
community grow and strengthen for all of
