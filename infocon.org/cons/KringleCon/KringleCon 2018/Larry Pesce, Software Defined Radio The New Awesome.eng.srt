00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:19,380
hello krinkle Khan

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,740
oh man it's awesome to be here thank you

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,369
so much mr. Claus mrs. Claus for

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,320
inviting me to come out and speak to you

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,810
on software-defined radio that new

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,579
awesome you know speaking speaking of

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,949
awesome it was it was really great to

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,149
come and take the train up here it was

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,920
it was definitely a lifetime of waiting

11
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,969
to do something like that and it was

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,030
just one of those things that I'm always

13
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,450
always going to remember and speaking of

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,399
something to always remember I can't

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,570
wait to tell you all about some of the

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
fun things that I've been doing with

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,110
some software-defined radio and and you

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,340
know some of them just the little things

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:03,000
why I think it's so awesome all right so

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,210
a little bit about me I am a penetration

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,909
tester and hardware hacker and all sorts

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,860
of fun stuff at a little company that

23
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,430
does pen testing of all sorts of

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,900
varieties called in guardians I'm the

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,180
director of research there and this has

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,619
been some the things that I've been

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,780
looking at just for various projects

28
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,570
across the board for pen testing and

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,460
otherwise I'm also a sans certified

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,130
instructor my primary course is the

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,759
wireless course go figure

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:36,658
sex 617 ethical hacking wireless I'm

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,390
also the silent founder and a regular

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,909
host of Paul's security weekly and I

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,880
have my extra craft class ham radio

36
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,880
operator my callsign is kilo bravo one

37

tango November Foxtrot so if it isn't

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,890
pretty evident I have a strong interest

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,460
in radio of all sorts of varieties hence

40
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,320
why I'm here to speak to you today but a

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,369
software-defined radio all right so

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,969
let's give you a little bit of

43
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,790
background

44
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,949
what is software-defined radio it's it's

45
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,890
a radio that has no preconceived notion

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,840
of purpose we define what the radio does

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,050
in software

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,300
so with various software applications on

49
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,390
a computing platform of some variety

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,300
whether it be a Raspberry Pi or a laptop

51
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:25,000
desktop or some others purpose-built

52
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,890
device we can take a radio and turn it

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,950
in to effectively whatever we want with

54
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,920
software and this has become something

55
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,170
that's been wildly popular and has

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,910
increased in popularity over the last

57
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,100
couple of years just because now the

58
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,859
hardware has become so much more

59
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,810
accessible to the average user and we'll

60
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,000
talk a little bit about that that said

61
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,489
because it has become accessible from

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,269
both a hardware and a project a software

63
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,860
perspective they're now unlocked the

64
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,140
ability for us to look at all sorts of

65
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,420
new protocols that we hadn't been

66
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,250
exposed to before or from a security

67
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:05,290
perspective also for lots of fun as well

68
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,930
so thinking about this multitude of

69
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,179
software-defined radio stuff that has

70
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,630
shown to market and is relatively

71
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,950
affordable I've got a couple of my

72
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,320
favorites

73
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:21,130
there's the hack RF with transmit and

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,190
receive at about $300 the bleed RF is

75
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,430
about 375 a little bit more with receive

76
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,910
and transmit arguably one of the

77
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,720
industry leaders from ettus the the b200

78
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:37,480
mini with receive and transmit at

79
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,280
roughly $800 now we're starting to get a

80
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,149
little bit you know out of the range of

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,030
what the CFO will approve but still

82
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,850
really great stuff however one of my

83
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,170
absolute favorites is something that's

84
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:56,049
incredibly inexpensive it's the RTL SDR

85
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,458
a real tech based inexpensive

86
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,280
software-defined radio that was

87
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,110
originally intended for doing something

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,940
else entirely it was only found later

89
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,790
that it was an actual sort of mini

90
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,590
software-defined radio a high quality

91
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,370
one with a great kit with all sorts of

92
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:16,600
antennas is about $35 now there receive

93
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:19,329
only but still with receive it gives us

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,609
the ability to start doing a significant

95
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,659
amount of analysis of software-defined

96
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:25,909
radio and radio part of

97
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,320
just from the get-go to even see if this

98
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,310
is something we're interested in or if

99
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,960
there's something that we need to

100
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,570
investigate further and spend more money

101
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,849
on all right so I think receiving is fun

102
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,230
you know I'm a computer guy I like to

103
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,990
just sit back and be a Wallflower and

104
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,210
listen sometimes and on on the radio

105
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,880
side what that really means is I can sit

106
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,180
listen and then find stuff that I didn't

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,200
know was there before and then of course

108
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,380
when I find something that I didn't know

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:58,190
was there I asked myself what do they do

110
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,870
and what are they there for and what are

111
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,719
they controlling and what type of

112
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,440
information is there and in some of

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,110
these cases you find some very odd an

114
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,900
unexpected type of things so let's talk

115
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,830
about some of those those things now for

116
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,479
me I like to use some software to

117
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,950
discover some signals and I'm going to

118
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,320
show this to you in a little bit

119
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,440
assuming one of my demos doesn't work

120
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,469
but one of the the pieces of software

121
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,600
that I like to use with my rtl-sdr to

122
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,170
discover signals see if there's anything

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,720
there initially is an application called

124
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:41,480
GQ rx it is largely platform

125
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,240
cross-platform compatible meaning I use

126
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,740
it natively on my Mac I use it in a

127
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,560
Linux virtual machine I use it on a

128
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:52,070
Linux box all the time I'm told that it

129
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,020
will run on Windows but I'm not so much

130
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,280
of a Windows guy so I haven't used it

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,280
much there and it's a little bit

132
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,719
difficult to to install via pothos and

133
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,869
so forth

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,680
however SDR sharp is very similar on

135
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:10,640
Windows give us the ability to tune our

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,040
software-defined radio into a station or

137
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,789
a frequency and then we'll visualize

138
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,340
what everything is there so we can see

139
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,080
whether there was something present in

140
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,179
on the airwaves that we know we can't

141
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,650
see with our own eyes now gives us the

142
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,860
ability to start drilling down and

143
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:31,099
figuring out where we may want to may

144
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,380
want to use so this is going to use our

145
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,590
local software-defined radio to look at

146
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,330
local signals and we can even now start

147
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,508
turning

148
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,219
seems you some stuff worldwide as there

149
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,229
are a number of folks that have taken

150
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,719
their software-defined radios in some

151
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,909
variety and connected them to the

152
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:51,789
internet go figure and allow you to use

153
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:54,069
their software to find radio in the case

154
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:58,539
there's a catalogue of them at web SDR

155
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:00,930
org and one of my favorites is at the

156
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:04,090
University of Twente and the Netherlands

157
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,340
which is here on the slide but let's

158
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,039
take a look at what that actually looks

159
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:17,378
like assuming of course I can get this

160
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:19,479
over to my web browser alright and we've

161
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:24,009
connected to the web SDR at the

162
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:31,240
University of Twente and I've tuned this

163
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:34,389
to 46 25 kilohertz and this happens to

164
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,250
be a fairly famous famous thing here we

165
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:39,909
can see in the waterfall display as it

166
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,729
goes by I've zoomed in quite a bit we're

167
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:45,729
actually listening to the Russian buzzer

168
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:49,180
station which is allegedly one of those

169
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:51,460
number stations that were used for

170
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,699
communicating with spies and so forth we

171
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,529
don't really don't know what the the

172
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,479
purpose of the buzzer station is but

173
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:02,229
it's also fairly difficult to hear in

174
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,250
many parts of the US such as where I

175
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:07,930
live or potentially at the North Pole so

176
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,460
by using one connected remotely to the

177
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,440
Internet we can actually extend our

178
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,539
range for some of this stuff as well so

179
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,610
this one's pretty neat to listen to and

180
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:18,128
you can use this from a web browser to

181
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:24,639
actually place all sorts of audio I have

182
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:27,069
this one buta currently alright but what

183
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,629
else can we do so we can use the

184
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,879
software-defined radio to visualize

185
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,519
locally we can also use some stuff to

186
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,240
visualize remotely such as those listed

187
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,849
as web SDR and I've also recently

188
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,789
successfully used the audio from one of

189
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:44,920
those remotes and piping it through like

190
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,920
a virtual audio cable so we can redirect

191
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,779
audio from the web browser to another

192
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,699
software application to catch the data

193
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:56,920
the case of the one that I was looking

194
00:08:52,699 --> 00:09:00,859
at was the ability to do tracking for

195
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:04,729
APRs to a location that I couldn't

196
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,459
receive that data locally alright so we

197
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,680
looked at the the demo of of that I got

198
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:12,199
ahead of myself a little bit there in

199
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,748
any case there's all sorts of other fun

200
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:16,519
stuff that's available and lots of it in

201
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:21,350
areas that most people wouldn't

202
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:24,470
necessarily consider the 433 megahertz

203
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,720
ASM band industrial scientific and

204
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,670
medical largely across the world it

205
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,589
doesn't require the user to have a

206
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:34,790
license this is all of your consumer

207
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:41,149
stuff and there's all sorts of fun stuff

208
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:44,480
in the 433 megahertz range but we don't

209
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:46,720
necessarily know what it is however with

210
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,360
the RTL SDR there is a software package

211
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:56,959
RTL underscore 433 has done a bunch of

212
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:00,350
community gathered signatures for

213
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,930
devices in the environment that they

214
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,730
know how to decode and when they see a

215
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,519
signal will attempt to decode it based

216
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,680
against the previously matched signals

217
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,500
and some of them some of are good some

218
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,229
of them are bad and some of them are too

219
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,779
lots of false positives and they have

220
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,629
more than a hundred devices currently

221
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:22,250
listed I think my current copy knows how

222
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:24,350
to decode for a hundred and thirteen

223
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:30,680
devices and about a hundred of them are

224
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:32,449
relatively reliable RTL 433 not only

225
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,370
will it decode and give you the output

226
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,649
from the stuff that it knows about based

227
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,389
on it signatures it will also give you

228
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:40,490
the generic output that we can do

229
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:42,769
additional analysis with and try to

230
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,860
recover and write our own fingerprints

231
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,660
for hey so I've used this quite a bit at

232
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,160
home was had a project that I was going

233
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:54,139
to be working on and was using it to

234
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,990
attempt to connect to my Oregon

235
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,929
Scientific weather sensors to populate a

236
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,519
weather display and when I fired that up

237
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,089
I discovered all sorts of other

238
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,829
interesting things as well

239
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:10,939
some of them that make you ask all sorts

240
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:12,290
of other questions so let's see what we

241
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:14,929
can see here and this is gonna be a

242
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:18,618
little bit demo that that goes across a

243
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:24,769
couple of things here let's see let's

244
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:29,980
try to run our TL 433 I was running this

245
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:33,859
earlier and wasn't having a lot of luck

246
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,869
that's because I have this now we

247
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:41,619
mentioned gqr X a little bit earlier and

248
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:44,689
this is gqr X I have it tuned to 430 3.9

249
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:47,269
megahertz which is in the 433 megahertz

250
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:49,790
is M band which I would expect a bunch

251
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:52,100
of stuff in my environment and clearly

252
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,439
there's some signals here looking at our

253
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,899
waterfall display that we see some stuff

254
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:59,179
over time and the fast Fourier transform

255
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:04,519
says that there's stuff happening in in

256
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:06,169
real time now there's stuff here I have

257
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,100
no idea what it is I can see that there

258
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:12,259
is stuff here so if we stop this and I

259
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,579
move back over to my terminal session

260
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:19,929
let's try and see what happens when we

261
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:25,339
run our TL 433 oh well can't open it

262
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:27,019
let's plug it replug it back in and

263
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:31,279
trying to get alright it did fine it

264
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:33,290
this time it's tuned to 433 0.92 and I

265
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,069
would expect in in a minute or two here

266
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,709
for stuff to show up but I turn tried

267
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:42,110
this earlier with my weather sensor that

268
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:44,029
I brought with me and it turns out it

269
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,679
didn't work so well I wonder if it's

270
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,959
just too cold here at the North Pole

271
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,579
maybe my device is a little on the cold

272
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,609
side in frozen it's not working properly

273
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:55,160
but you get the idea fairly simple

274
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,139
command-line tool and will start giving

275
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,139
us output from all sorts of fun stuff

276
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:06,169
that's not what I want I want this one

277
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,619
all right so we saw some stuff with GQ

278
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:10,369
rx

279
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:12,499
not so much with RTL 433 given that my

280
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:16,070
my weather sensor is probably way too

281
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:17,810
cold here at the North Pole but

282
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,720
we can also do all sorts of other fun

283
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,390
stuff with our rtl-sdr such as using

284
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,860
something like RTL FM one of the

285
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,069
built-in utilities for the software

286
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,960
package to tune into some radio

287
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:34,190
frequencies and then type that outbound

288
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,650
to other stuff and one of those other

289
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,200
pieces of software that we can use as a

290
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,689
tool called multi Mon ng and well it's

291
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,430
also not just for radio we'll do all

292
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,570
sorts of other stuff such as decoding

293
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,489
DTMF or tone dialing decoding Morse code

294
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,160
all sorts of other fun stuff it will

295
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:55,340
also do pager traffic such as box AG and

296
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,860
flex so if we can take the raw audio

297
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:02,510
output from our one of our RTL tools

298
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:05,980
such as RTL FM and send that via Linux

299
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:08,990
pipe to multi mono G we can now start

300
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,760
decoding any of that page of traffic now

301
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,390
be careful where you are because that

302
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:18,020
may or may not be permissible by law in

303
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,610
your jurisdiction but you can also start

304
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,170
doing some research on potentially

305
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,970
setting up your own pager transmitters

306
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:27,020
for for doing this as well so

307
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,550
interesting fun stuff and there's all

308
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,000
sorts of other interesting information

309
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,859
for PAC's AG and fleck where it was a

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,200
protocol that was designed many years

311
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,740
ago where no one thought it was a good

312
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:43,630
idea to have any encryption included

313
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:47,180
there all right we've done a bunch of

314
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,770
receive-only stuff and with the RTL SDR

315
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,569
it's a great way to get started in

316
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,850
listening but what if we wanted to do

317
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,650
some transmit well there's a couple of

318
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:59,060
ways that we can do so inexpensively

319
00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:01,520
with not a lot of great fidelity we can

320
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,300
use a Raspberry Pi to toggle GPIO pin

321
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,689
and we can use to packages our PI T X

322
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:12,469
Raspberry Pi transmit or PI FM for doing

323
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,180
FM radio those work really well can be

324
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,890
lots of fun and we can create all sorts

325
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,060
of different transmitter types with that

326
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,770
as well

327
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,349
we also have something kind of new

328
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:27,110
that's interesting is a project called

329
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:29,090
FL 2k which uses some custom drivers for

330
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,699
the FL 2000 chipset which are often

331
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,079
featured

332
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:38,699
in inexpensive USB 3.0 to VGA adapters

333
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:42,209
which run under $15 on Amazon so yeah we

334
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,679
can use a VGA adapter to transmit RF

335
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:47,339
signals which we can receive with

336
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:50,429
rtl-sdr that's kind of frightening now

337
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,489
it's not a great range and it's not the

338
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:54,988
best fidelity but for 15 bucks that's

339
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:58,009
kind of priced right and can be lots of

340
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:58,009
fun to experiment with

341
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,109
so there's lots of stuff that can

342
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:07,919
actually be done with FL 2k we can send

343
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:10,139
FM radio FM modulated signals we can do

344
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:14,699
you some with some of the sample stuff

345
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:19,139
we can spoof GPS we can spoof cellular

346
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:22,799
UMTS LTE GSM we can do digital video we

347
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:27,449
can do digital audio we have now a bunch

348
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:30,239
of methods for creating data which is in

349
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:33,660
the air which is eventually kind of

350
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:35,609
terrifying because what does this really

351
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,079
end up meaning is that now we're going

352
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:38,939
to potentially find in our environment

353
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,919
all sorts of you know quote rogue

354
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:44,669
transmitters that can be repurposed just

355
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:48,119
like the FL 2000 chipset and those VGA

356
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:50,339
dongles that we can now do data exfil

357
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:54,179
that is now no longer considered nations

358
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:56,489
state only capabilities there's a

359
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,019
project that my intern and I worked on

360
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:01,019
called vapour trail that uses a

361
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,539
Raspberry Pi to do just those same types

362
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,609
of transmissions that would have been

363
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:08,220
previously considered nation-state only

364
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:10,740
capability and if you're really scared

365
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,949
about some of this type of stuff drago's

366
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,500
has some stuff that he's been working on

367
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,569
and analyzing RF based transmissions

368
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,130
coming out of all sorts of various

369
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:22,079
things that are probably either in your

370
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,539
home or enterprise such as this

371
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,638
keyboards motherboards the USB drives

372
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:30,870
all sorts of things that are now quote

373
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:33,299
unintentional transmitters so what next

374
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,709
for all this type of stuff you know what

375
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,179
does this really mean that we can have

376
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,279
inexpensive transmitters and even

377
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,529
inexpensive receivers what does it

378
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,560
really mean for data exfiltration for

379
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:47,580
both a pen test with command and control

380
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,440
or with some other malicious actor or

381
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,879
command-and-control can they now go out

382
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,980
of band that you don't have the ability

383
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,690
to detect with your traditional tools so

384
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:01,400
now we need to sort of step up our game

385
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,020
and do additional RF detection programs

386
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:08,310
to start hunting some of the stuff down

387
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:10,560
because now this is just no longer a

388
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,419
pipe dream of the paranoid its allegedly

389
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,820
happening and the toolset is becoming

390
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:19,080
more and more robust to make this happen

391
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,879
to take all of this stuff out of band so

392
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,730
with this we're just scratching the

393
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,040
surface I'm probably about over time we

394
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,050
have so much that we can explore with

395
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,050
software-defined radio we have so much

396
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,870
that we can interact with and what ones

397
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:36,300
are we finding that the leaked

398
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,250
information from our environment that

399
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,830
may be considered information that we

400
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,120
don't want out and then how can an

401
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,790
attacker interact with that to

402
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,790
potentially change our environment or

403
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:50,010
use that as part of information for some

404
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,020
other part of an engagement or some

405
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,500
other attack okay so with that

406
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,150
software-defined radio has opened up so

407
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,570
much more of this wireless spectrum for

408
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:03,900
both attackers and for us as security

409
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:08,159
professionals to use and to be concerned

410
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:10,530
about so with that again thank you to

411
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,660
the causes for for bringing me here to

412
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:16,110
the North Pole it's greatly appreciated

413
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:19,260
it's been great talking with you for for

414
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,449
this time and I do hope that you do

415
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,150
enjoy the rest of your con stay warm and

416
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,160
if there any questions don't hesitate to

417
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,140
reach out and I'd be happy to follow up

418
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,480
and you know talk to you about some

419
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,630
software-defined radio stuff thanks

420
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,630
again
