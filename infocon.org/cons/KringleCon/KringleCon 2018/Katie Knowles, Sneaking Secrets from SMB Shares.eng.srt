1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
hey everyone hope you're enjoying your

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,609
krinkle con so far i know i'm really

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,960
excited to be here being able to share

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,670
some stuff that i've learned with you

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,290
guys it's really exciting to be at the

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,240
North Pole this weekend - thank you -

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,610
Sansa for the invite took a lot of time

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,859
to get up here I thought flights to the

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,800
UK were bad but it's been a lot of fun

10
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,350
so far and it's great to see you all and

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,090
more importantly I'm just so how many

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,910
chances do you get to share holiday

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,970
themes hacking tricks with people so

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,710
I've brought to you um something that I

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,559
like to think of as we spend all this

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,790
time on these more complicated tools or

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,218
scripts that people have written but

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,559
sometimes we forget that it's the simple

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,329
things that really make a difference and

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,899
there's just something so classically

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,670
nefarious about looking at what we've

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,219
already got access to what might be

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,989
under our noses and see if we can use

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,510
that to get a little bit more in depth

25
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,640
on our tests so I'm hoping this helps

26
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,309
you out a little bit but I'm also

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,100
noticing that our we've kind of like

28
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,539
teamed up with this guy for this talk

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,739
he's called The Grinch I don't know if

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,049
you guys know him he's known more for a

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,580
physical pentesting but he agreed to

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,430
help us out today but he's looking kind

33
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,229
of not like you were and he looks a

34
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,990
little like ah there we go

35
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,350
much better looks just like us good to

36
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,060
go so here's the setup the Grinch has

37
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,000
kind of helped us out already he's set

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,799
up a phishing page for us and he's sent

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,960
out an email to the users of Whoville

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,850
with a fake login page and a holiday

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,860
software update maybe some nice new

42
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,509
screen savers so they can see some

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,850
falling snow oh when they're away from

44
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,790
their computers but it's actually our

45
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,820
msf phantom payload so msf venom has

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,729
packaged a meterpreter payload for us

47
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,880
and when meterpreter is executed on that

48
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,619
workstation by a user it gives us a sort

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,470
of an advanced reverse shell that we can

50
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,280
use in the Metasploit framework so we've

51
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,679
got access inside this network and we've

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,630
got credentials how lucky are we

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,579
even if we're a limited user we've got a

54
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,610
pretty good foothold to work with this

55
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,750
Grinch guy doesn't seem half bad right

56
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,788
we've all been listening to this holiday

57
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,440
music for so long and we don't want to

58
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,089
admit how catchy it is right so maybe

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,950
we'll just pretend to be a little bit

60
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,120
crunchy a little bit grumpy

61
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,280
for now and if we catch ourselves

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,260
humming along to the soundtrack we'll

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,480
just ignore that for now so anyways

64
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,609
here's our setup we can kind of think

65
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,190
about what of their access do we have

66
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,010
two users in the network some business

67
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,750
applications maybe any who well who

68
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,359
knows their Christmas tree organizing

69
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,099
that looks pretty juicy and we've got

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,780
some support maybe there's some really

71
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,790
valuable stuff over there that might

72
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,430
even let us get domain admin one day

73
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,530
right and for those of you who know a

74
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,599
little bit of the setup ah already I can

75
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,640
already hear you practically screaming

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,738
oh man I know what's next right I've got

77
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,329
my favorite tools I've got bloodhound

78
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,280
and I've gotta test these credentials

79
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,140
against every system we have I'm gonna

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,180
scan the entire network for

81
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,760
vulnerabilities and we're just gonna get

82
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,860
in so fast we're gonna get so much we're

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,560
gonna care bro stuff it's gonna be great

84
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,750
and you're right it is gonna be great

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,030
but in the meantime some of those scans

86
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,670
might take a little bit right a little

87
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,140
while to run and maybe we're trying to

88
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,048
crack some stuff that we've already got

89
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,048
but if we're cracking a ticket you can't

90
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,620
use that yet what are we gonna do in the

91
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,959
meantime

92
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,540
right or maybe we've mapped a path out

93
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,970
to domain admin but we don't have the

94
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,888
credentials to get there yet what else

95
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,840
can we do so while we wait right we

96
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,910
could make coffee we could pretend we're

97
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,190
not humming along to Christmas songs or

98
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,790
we could try looking around maybe a

99
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,340
little bit simpler for now so here's the

100
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,230
setup this is our strategy right I'm

101
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,630
Katy Knowles just for context I'm your

102
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,399
speaker and co-conspirator today along

103
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,650
with the Grinch I'm also a security

104
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,720
consultant and pen tester with M WR info

105
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,000
security and what we're gonna be doing

106
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,859
is searching for Samba shares on the

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,170
internal network we've got a foothold in

108
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,120
we're gonna find sensitive files and

109
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,089
we're gonna look for some administrative

110
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,200
leftovers that might give us

111
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,639
administrative credentials right off the

112
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,738
bat you never know what you're gonna

113
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,989
find it's a lot of fun to look around

114
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,280
for this stuff

115
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,380
starting right off we're gonna be

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,579
looking internal to the network right so

117
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,358
we're gonna be looking for Samba

118
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,700
services on ports 139 and 445 TCP for

119
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,430
now and we're just gonna try and

120
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,130
understand where systems with open Samba

121
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,600
shares are once we've we know what

122
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,130
systems have those shares

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,470
we'll be using the credentials we've got

124
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,740
for now to see what access we can have

125
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,020
and we're also gonna be trying to

126
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,390
understand you know what files are on

127
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,210
those shares this is usually the point

128
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,640
where I like switching over to the

129
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,680
Windows command line the reason for that

130
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,630
is it's a little bit easier to work with

131
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,790
there are definitely ways to do this in

132
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,400
Linux as well and I encourage you to try

133
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,400
them out but sometimes it's just a

134
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,719
little bit easier to use meterpreter

135
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,909
sort of advanced reverse shell access

136
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,060
and drop into a Windows command-line

137
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,660
shell Network mount the drive so that

138
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,940
net use and then use things like find

139
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,430
strings of finder or search for

140
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,780
directories that contain keywords and

141
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,490
you notice you can use a wild-card

142
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,919
approach for a quote there's a bunch of

143
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,630
different flags you can explore here but

144
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,860
in my experience this will be a little

145
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,820
quicker to find us what we want

146
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,250
switching over to our sort of demo

147
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,570
network right you don't have life

148
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,550
dollars today but we've got some

149
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,670
evidence right of what we've been able

150
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,130
to find we're gonna have to pivot this

151
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,600
traffic and you might notice this isn't

152
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,360
something I mentioned before right in

153
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,510
this case we've got our meterpreter

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,330
foothold on a workstation of the user

155
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,789
but we still need a way for our traffic

156
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,099
to get there right I need my traffic

157
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,860
from Metasploit or my traffic from kali

158
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,710
linux to go through into their network

159
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,570
and the way we're gonna make that happen

160
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,030
here for this example is we're gonna use

161
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,340
the socks proxy so we're gonna set up

162
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,369
the Metasploit framework socks proxy you

163
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,950
can figure that to run through our

164
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,110
medical interpreter session and then

165
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,990
we're gonna be able to run commands like

166
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,660
proxy chains that go through the socks

167
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,820
proxy and let us run our tools against

168
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,860
the network as if we had access to those

169
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,630
addresses so once we've got that running

170
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,520
you'll notice we can use that NMAC

171
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,130
command very similarly to how we would

172
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,680
before and we can get some responses

173
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,390
from things I don't actually have the

174
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,910
nmap output here the funny thing about

175
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,940
this is you'll notice as proxy chains

176
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,550
tries to connect to each port it

177
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,870
actually gives you whether it was able

178
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,160
to contact that port or not

179
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,620
so we can definitely

180
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,240
for NMAC results but we're also starting

181
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,760
to see some part four or five that's

182
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,220
already open in this case another way to

183
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,289
do this sort of thing would be purely

184
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,570
through net exploit you can use the

185
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,210
multi managed auto relevant module which

186
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,710
lets you autorap traffic that's in memfs

187
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,750
floyd through that meterpreter session

188
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,239
to the network and then scan within

189
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,680
Metasploit if you really want to I kind

190
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,620
of like sticking to the tools that I've

191
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,410
got that I'm used to once I've got the

192
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,360
proxy set up but whatever works for you

193
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,350
and definitely encourage you to try

194
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,090
things so alright we found a share

195
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,770
that's open for some reason thirty-one

196
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,539
looked good to us right ten one one

197
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,330
thirty one it's got a ring to it almost

198
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,610
so we're gonna look at that share and

199
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,530
the reason I've switched over to SMB map

200
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,870
in this case the reason I like it so

201
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,450
much is it's gonna tell us what access

202
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,030
our account has what permissions we have

203
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,979
for each share we've got so we've got

204
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,559
access it looks like to the whyville

205
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,210
share and something called home now home

206
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,060
that can be pretty interesting sometimes

207
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,620
right it has a lot of users home files

208
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,010
maybe if the permissions aren't set

209
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,060
right

210
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,620
who knows what's over there but for now

211
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,380
we're just gonna look at the wife L

212
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,390
share and what you don't see here is

213
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,490
that I've done one of those net use

214
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,969
commands and I've mounted the wife LLL

215
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,220
share which is now the C Drive on the

216
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,200
compromised station so now we know what

217
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,930
user we've compromised right it's Cindy

218
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,000
and Cindy's workstation now has this

219
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,400
Drive mounted maybe that seems a little

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,410
suspicious but we're just gonna go with

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,810
it for today for simplicity's sake we're

222
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,190
gonna look for passwords in that wide

223
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,550
they'll share that we've mounted and

224
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:27,419
we'll notice that there's already some

225
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,550
stuff showing up and we'll also notice

226
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,870
that the home directory is also in the

227
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,479
wife L shares so sometimes things like

228
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,750
this happen write multiple folders end

229
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,990
up in multiple places but in this case

230
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,789
what we want to focus on is that the

231
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,360
Facebook password is here and this is

232
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:48,240
not a domain account right this isn't

233
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,100
quite as exciting as we were hoping but

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,290
it's something and if we're gonna test

235
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,090
different users around the network or if

236
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,500
we're gonna maybe cindy has an

237
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,570
of account right you never know when

238
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,350
past swords are going to be reused or

239
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,000
when they're going to have very similar

240
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,290
likenesses to each other some other

241
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,890
interesting terms you might search for

242
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,079
I've listed below one thing to note here

243
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,569
that I want to call out specifically is

244
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,640
always the careful of the scope so when

245
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,650
we're on a client's assessment when

246
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,449
we're testing someone else's network we

247
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,220
want to be really careful what we do and

248
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,580
don't look at so there's gonna be some

249
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,170
files there that we probably would want

250
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,029
to know if people can access them but

251
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,729
when it comes to stuff like HR data or

252
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,870
personal information you might not want

253
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,120
to touch it right you should always

254
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,940
check first double checking against what

255
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,680
you can and can't access and just when

256
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,600
in doubt you know don't touch it or ask

257
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,130
whoever your contact is alright so that

258
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,180
didn't get us what we were hoping for

259
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:50,189
just yet but we've got other tricks up

260
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,770
our sleeve right we've got the sysvol

261
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,290
share so every domain controller is

262
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,569
gonna contain a sis fall Samba share and

263
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,459
the reason this exists is to contain

264
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,010
scripts and group policy settings that

265
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,680
systems need to pull in order to be part

266
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,200
of the domain the downside to this is

267
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,849
that there can be some really well

268
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,860
upside for us right there can be some

269
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,290
really interesting information left

270
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,620
behind and historically it hasn't been

271
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,030
the most secure place either so in this

272
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,460
case we're just gonna talk first about

273
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,130
the scripts so scripts are things that

274
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,450
administrators might have provided for a

275
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,740
system to get set up right changing

276
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,260
local passwords are connecting to

277
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,760
certain systems with credentials and a

278
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,189
lot of the times they can be unencrypted

279
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,430
if you go around something like um

280
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,350
the tech net or any sort of powershell

281
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,209
galleries or who knows what scripts are

282
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,450
out there right and who knows how secure

283
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,589
those scripts are if I'm an admin and I

284
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,060
need to get something configured

285
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,220
yesterday I might not be paying

286
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,979
attention to that or I might not know

287
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,810
that every authenticated user has access

288
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,520
to the sysvol share and that people

289
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,319
might check it so you never know what's

290
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,209
gonna be on here that's the other thing

291
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,120
sometimes there's other stuff not even

292
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:02,250
scripts or what we're about to talk

293
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,620
about but just other information that

294
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,650
system administrators have kept so it's

295
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,530
always a good idea to check up on this

296
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,540
in our Whoville Network this ends up

297
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,579
looking a little bit like so we check up

298
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,819
on the share we notice we've got access

299
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,160
to the sysvol share and we mount it once

300
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,470
that's mounted the directory of it has

301
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,000
this scripts folder now for the sake of

302
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,700
time we're not gonna go into the scripts

303
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,050
just yet but we are about to look at

304
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:32,930
that policies folder right above it here

305
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,900
it is so this is probably the most

306
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,489
nefarious of today's tricks in my

307
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:42,020
opinion there's something very

308
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:44,720
satisfying and evil about this the group

309
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,470
policy preferences are stored under the

310
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,060
policies folder and until very recently

311
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,620
they allowed the storage of an

312
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,060
administrative password that would be

313
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,190
configured this is a local administrator

314
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,560
account to be specific this is not a

315
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,840
domain administrator or a helpdesk

316
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,239
administrator it's just when you look in

317
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,760
with log in with a local admin password

318
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,130
on a system but you need a way to

319
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,160
configure that right so if I'm trying to

320
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,680
configure 50 systems or hundred systems

321
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,560
or 500 systems I'm not gonna do that

322
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,000
manually in this case you could set the

323
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:23,150
CE password attribute and it would be

324
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,750
encrypted with a key that Microsoft

325
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:29,290
exposed right not a static key be

326
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,800
encrypted right it should be fine and

327
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,839
stored in that policy is folder so in

328
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,300
this case if we have access to the

329
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,960
policies folder we've access to the

330
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,260
policy preferences and we've access to

331
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,680
the C password string and we have access

332
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,569
to the AES key that used to encrypt it

333
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,819
it's yeah right so there's already a

334
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,360
tool for this built into Kali Linux it's

335
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,190
called GPP decrypt it's pretty simple

336
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,320
here's a little bit of how it works so

337
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,990
in this case we've mounted the sysvol

338
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,540
share we're searching for passwords in

339
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,570
the sysvol share and we've got one of

340
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,310
those C password strings so we copy it

341
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,560
put it down in front of GPP decrypt and

342
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,359
what do you know we've got a local

343
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,640
administrator password who knows where

344
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,160
else that's going to be useful so that

345
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,889
one might be good to check around and

346
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,868
the

347
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,910
pending on the network or the

348
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:25,859
configuration or the way they administer

349
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,269
things at this point we might have a

350
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:31,859
pretty you know hefty pile of

351
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,949
credentials that we could test while our

352
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:37,439
other tests are still going on so what

353
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:40,108
do you think that was our master plan we

354
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:42,179
can see what shares are exposed and see

355
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:43,709
what information is lying around in them

356
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,019
you never know what's going to be there

357
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,029
honestly the configuration of these is

358
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,709
it's really tough to handle and that's

359
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,540
why it's important to check up on these

360
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:54,089
and also when you find these sorts of

361
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,399
things if you're on an engagement it's

362
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:57,839
so so important to help the client

363
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,970
understand that this matters right

364
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,769
people don't always know especially

365
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,839
about the group policy preferences and

366
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:05,040
things that go insist fall and taking

367
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,169
the time to make sure they understand

368
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,399
the risk there and just how easy that

369
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:12,689
was can go a long way there's a lot of

370
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,100
different ways to do this

371
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:16,199
and for some of you who are more

372
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,879
experienced testers I'm guessing this

373
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,889
whole time you're thinking oh but that's

374
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,040
two lines with this one tool I know

375
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:25,169
and you're right it's pretty easy but

376
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,238
going through the basic steps of it with

377
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:28,739
some commands that are a little bit you

378
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:30,749
know closer to the ground easier to

379
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:33,239
understand may be that living off the

380
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:34,529
land approach gives us an approach to

381
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,509
make sure we know what's going on with

382
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,100
those tools so for those of you who are

383
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,319
newer to this if this was the first time

384
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,999
you saw it I absolutely encourage you to

385
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:43,259
go out and try some other ways of doing

386
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:45,600
it and some different tools and

387
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:47,249
approaches and the other features of

388
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,009
those tools might lead you down a path

389
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:52,230
to some other you know amazing surprises

390
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:57,089
and who knows what other features you

391
00:14:52,230 --> 00:15:00,569
might find so that was our holiday heist

392
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:03,269
I hope you have a happy holiday season

393
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:05,549
and try new tricks on your adventures

394
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,369
and most importantly enjoy kringle con

395
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:10,679
and help stand to understand the

396
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:11,459
importance of security obviously we're

397
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,249
all here today

398
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:16,439
right so he definitely cares about

399
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:18,629
security but we're here to make that

400
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:20,099
communication that translation right we

401
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,859
got to make it happen so that all these

402
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,939
North Pole breaches stop happening all

403
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:26,749
right thanks so much

404
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:26,748
hope you have a great one
