00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,119
mostly how attackers are going after

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,680
your infrastructure and how attackers

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,519
are ripping through our security systems

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,160
and what you can do to protect

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,109
yourselves so a special thanks to 2x

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,980
Pole it's a definitely a little bit

20
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,840
colder than I thought it would be here

21
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,339
but definitely happy to be here with

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,250
Santa Claus and the elves getting

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,079

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,120
brief introduction myself my name is

Dave Kennedy I'm the founder and CEO of

26

trusted second and founder of binder

27
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,410
defense systems we're located in

28
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,870
Cleveland Ohio but have folks all over

29
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,929
the place I've been in the news quite

30
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,640
frequently on CNBC Fox News CNN talking

31
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,589
about a lot of different breaches that

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
have been occurring in the media and as

33
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,750
of right now with a lot of the the

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,610
breaches that we're seeing around the

35
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,930
holiday time frames this is a perfect

36
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,179
conversation to have about what's

37
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,740
happening out there the demographics of

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,619
attackers and and what folks are doing

39
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,570
to protect themselves on these chilly

40
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,250
times of the season I'm also the author

41
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,470
of the social engineer toolkits

42
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,840
co-author of Metasploit the penetration

43
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,369
testers guide and I've also authored a

44
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,060
number of open-source tools like

45
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,900
artillery unicorn the pen testers

46
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,070
framework but in general my whole MO is

47
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,600
trying to give as much back to the

48
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,579
community as possible and really humbled

49
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,869
at the community that we have have

50
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,369
around information security and it's

51
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,290
just like events like these like Kringle

52
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,450
khan that just make it such a unique

53
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,570
industry and what we're trying to do to

54
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,920
make the world a better place and so my

55
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,119
whole motto is is really trying to give

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,790
back to the community and everything

57
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,340
that we can do out there today so

58
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,630
welcome everybody to to Kringle Khan the

59
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,090
North Pole is actually a very

60
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,100
interesting place Santa has to deal with

61
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,590
a lot of different attacks and exposures

62
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,408
as Christmas comes along he's in the

63
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,450
news often his elfs they're continuously

64
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,069
working when he's got a Prosecco lots of

65
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,149
controllers and skated devices helping

66
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,379
build the toys and and the

67
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,549
the four-wheelers and everything that

68
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,280
our kids are looking forward to this

69
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:19,870
year and most importantly with with any

70
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,069
of those devices and anything that's

71
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,290
happening out there Security's

72
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:25,899
definitely a paramount and definitely

73
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,459
something that you want to taking into

74
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,829
consideration as we're going through and

75
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,989
looking at a lot of the different areas

76
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:33,459
that that are out there and so I want to

77
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,170
say a special thanks to Santa Claus for

78
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,730
having me out here yeah I was talking on

79
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,500
the phone the other day and I he's like

80
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,750
hey can you just shoot by the North Pole

81
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,220
real quick I'll send my send my sleigh

82
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,200
out and we'll get you to the North Pole

83
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,549
and and have a conversation to our elves

84
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,980
Santa and all of our friends out there

85
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:50,440
today to talk about what's happening and

86
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,548
how Santa can protect themselves from a

87
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,379
lot of the things that are that are

88
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,299
happening out there in the wild and so

89
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:56,920
happy to be out here Sienna thanks for

90
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,980
having me and I hope all the contestants

91
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,138
have a good time so this topic really

92
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,700
talks about from a security standpoint

93
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,189
what we're seeing out there and I like

94
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,409
to balance my talks both high level and

95
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:11,230
technical there's a variety of different

96
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,750
folks out here that are our attending

97
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,670
that have a wide aptitude of different

98
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,930
skill sets and so I try to kind of

99
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,518
tailor it to everybody about there so if

100
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,500
you're just brand new to information

101
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,879
security or you're somebody that that's

102
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,799
well-established an industry I hope you

103
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,910
have something that you learn from this

104
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,069
talk and something that you can learn

105
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,510
but most importantly these are the top

106
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,540
five things that we see out there today

107
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,429
both from a personal perspective as well

108
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,198
as what we see from from businesses and

109
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,389
corporations around how they're getting

110
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,829
attacked methods that attackers use to

111
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:40,569
gain access to your environment and

112
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:42,069
really kind of where things are trending

113
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,780
I don't like doing the hey what's my

114
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,518
predictions for the next year or next

115
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,199
five years but these are things that we

116
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,760
are commonly seeing is upward trends

117
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,680
that continuously happen year after year

118
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,048
and ways that corporations and companies

119
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,159
really have a difficult time protecting

120
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,109
themselves with with things that are

121
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,019
happening and so let's talk about the

122
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,639
five main areas right on how the grinch

123
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,169
could steal Christmas and around the

124
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,209
holiday time frames these are some of

125
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,829
the most toughest times when it comes to

126
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,169
attacks there's so much money being

127
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,510
spent out there today that it really

128
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,069
becomes a really rich environment for

129
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,569
attackers to go after everything from

130
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,399
scammers and going after different

131
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,889
Christmas schemes one of the ones that

132
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,478
we saw recently is it was it was holiday

133
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,909
themed where hackers are saying that we

134
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,620
been visiting bad sites and they used

135
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:25,479
previously compromised breach data to

136
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,889
send your password in the actual email

137
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,508
from the breach site saying

138
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,009
no we're gonna notify your family around

139
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,259
the holiday time frames unless you pay

140
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,879
these specific areas of Bitcoin so

141
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,979
hackers use this time to take advantage

142
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,360
of of what's actually occurring out

143
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:39,490
there and this isn't necessarily just

144
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,409
around the holiday time frames we just

145
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,719
see a massive upward tick around

146
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:46,180
scammers and around different campaigns

147
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:48,248
trying to steal information going after

148
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,870
retailers this time of the year tends to

149
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:52,120
be some of the most trickiest ones that

150
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,289
we see out there today and so the number

151
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,460
one most prominent way is social

152
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,729
engineering we'll definitely talk about

153
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,138
each one of these scams and ransomware

154
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,669
premiere flaws or areas that you have on

155
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:03,009
your your internet presence that might

156
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,080
be problematic around those weak

157
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,969
passwords still to this day tend to be a

158
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,400
major problem that we see out there and

159
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,229
obviously data breaches whenever a data

160
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,179
breach occurs the information that is

161
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,219
taken from those organizations can be

162
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,560
used against you into multiple different

163
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:19,089
ways and most importantly at the very

164
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,039
end we'll talk about the best ways to

165
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:23,110
defend yourself and your business is

166
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,060
when it comes to the different types of

167
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,039
attacks and hopefully everybody is is

168
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,479
having a great time with family and

169
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,659
friends around these holiday time frames

170
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,099
I know for me it's one of the most it's

171
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:35,139
one of the best times of the year for me

172
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,789
I get to snuggle up with some hot

173
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,900
chocolate and kids and family and then

174
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,759
see different people and eat way too

175
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,318
much food so hopefully you're doing the

176
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,849
same as you're going through and helping

177
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:47,139
Santa protect against the hackers out

178
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:48,490
there so if you look at going after an

179
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,990
organization and I'd like to talk a

180
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,029
little bit about how breaches occur

181
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,379
there's there's a number of methods that

182
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:55,300
attackers go after I use social

183
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:58,029
engineering perimeter flaws weak

184
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,689
passwords patch management things like

185
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,069
that

186
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,149
but most importantly there's there's a

187
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,490
number of different motives that

188
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:06,250
attackers have when going after an

189
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,930
organization most most frequently we see

190
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,750
code deployments out is there a way for

191
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,909
us to drop something onto the system to

192
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,050
get code execution and the ability to

193
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:16,719
establish a command and control

194
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,250
infrastructure that allows us to attack

195
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:19,839
an organization and from there move to

196
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,120
different systems and gain access to

197
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,159
other systems and information and the

198
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,680
methods that they typically use still to

199
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:29,800
this day primarily around 82% tends to

200
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,870
be executables or binaries and and what

201
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,339
that means is taking an executable or a

202
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,110
piece of malware and dropping it off the

203
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,120
system and having it communicate back

204
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,979
and that's usually where most companies

205
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,230
focus a lot of their efforts on when it

206
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,550
comes to

207
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,900
protecting themselves and trying to

208
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,220
protect themselves from various

209
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,140
different pieces of of melody being

210
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,560
dropped we've look at some of the trends

211
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,090
about 14% it has moved more towards

212
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,010
PowerShell and partials are a

213
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,960
full-fledged programming language in the

214
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,550
Windows operating system that allows you

215
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,460
to write your own code and do different

216
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,780
things and so about 14% of all

217
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,000
compromises that racino has some

218
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,080
components of powershell exploitation

219
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,630
and which means that they're trying to

220
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,700
gain code execution or to execute code

221
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,370
on your system with the intent of

222
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,200
compromising it with PowerShell itself

223
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,520
and it could be PowerShell goes and

224
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,260
downloads additional code onto the

225
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,880
system or additional files or it

226
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,310
actually huge directly into memory which

227
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,659
makes it a lot more difficult now if you

228
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,820
look at the statistics there that's

229
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,560
that's that makes up about 96 percent of

230
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,450
the overall attack surface that we see

231
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,010
out there today primarily on Windows if

232
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,440
you look at what are what are called lob

233
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,710
as or living off the land binaries and

234
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,000
scripts these are new fronts of attack

235
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,789
that we're seeing out there very heavily

236
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,990
today and where the research is going

237
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,610
into this area and there's a lot of

238
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,530
great folks in the security industry

239
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,060
doing research on these areas but we've

240
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,219
seen them used and weaponized by

241
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,560
nation-states by organized crime by

242
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,030
ransomware campaigns and really where a

243
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,610
lot of this goes into is that when

244
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,750
window shifts out its operating system

245
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,310
and has a number of binaries their

246
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,140
executables that it comes along with it

247
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,760
and so there's a list of them right now

248
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,200
I think we totaled like 72 or so that

249
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,690
have been discovered both scripts and

250
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,490
executables that have the ability to

251
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,230
have additional functionality in it for

252
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,640
for code execution and the way that this

253
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,530
works is that it's a it's a code signing

254
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,450
executable built into the Windows

255
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,070
operating system and it may have some

256
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,990
additional functionality like hey I can

257
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,060
go out to the internet download a file

258
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,010
execute in its memory without any type

259
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,320
of logging whatsoever and these are

260
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,450
things that that usually go undetected

261
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,890
and fly underneath the radar and where a

262
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,479
lot of the researcher on detection is

263
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,190
coming into play right now because most

264
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,690
of these applications are build and net

265
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,220
and don't have a lot of logging

266
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,599
functionality around them so when they

267
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,950
execute they go and download from the

268
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
internet they have the ability to

269
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,880
execute memory and these are where most

270
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,620
corporations aren't focusing allow their

271
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,990
efforts on and rightfully so it's only

272
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,820
making about 4% of the total attack

273
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,590
service that we see out there but it's

274
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,910
definitely an area that we should be

275
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,200
looking at and trying to get our hands

276
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,880
around because it is going to be the

277
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,980
next front of attack and so most

278
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,520
companies really focusing on executables

279
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,470
and

280
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,689
essentially powershell with powershell

281
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,760
version 5 and version 6 and a lot of

282
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,690
integration into the operating system

283
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
which we'll talk about here in a little

284
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,960
bit there's a lot of benefits of

285
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,010
PowerShell and being able to get

286
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,540
PowerShell visibility in your

287
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,490
environment to detect malicious activity

288
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,439
whereas these binaries and scripts that

289
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,760
are code signed by Microsoft that gets

290
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,470
you around a lot of your application

291
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,140
control functionality that circumvent

292
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,220
those are a big deal and you look at

293
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,689
some of the other other methods are

294
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,090
reasons for attacks we have credential

295
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,830
theft information disclosure and data

296
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,630
access we're seeing a massive increase

297
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,970
in just what we call business wire fraud

298
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,010
transfers where in an attacker what

299
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,050
we'll call up the CFO or send an email

300
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,210
to the CFO or control within the

301
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,439
organization and request on behalf of a

302
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,110
merger and acquisition or they'll

303
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,750
compromise a third party organization

304
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,730
that that is our trusted vendor a trust

305
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,310
that their party requesting invoices be

306
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,020
sent to wire transfers invoices be sent

307
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,760
to a different location and then from

308
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,710
there hijacking that and funneling money

309
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,420
out of the company we just had one

310
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,760
recently for three million dollars that

311
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,920
got through and and so business wire

312
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,560
frauds are another one out there for a

313
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,360
huge huge cause for concern and so if

314
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,709
you look at at all of those different

315
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,720
areas we have a lot of risk in a lot of

316
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,670
areas that attackers or are going after

317
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,010
us and the demographics of attackers and

318
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,380
their sophistication really changes

319
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,180
based on on where you are in the

320
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,590
industry what you do the type of

321
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,810
intellectual property you have are the

322
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,790
customers that you have for example if

323
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,140
you're in the you know industrial

324
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,459
control system side where you're dealing

325
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,650
with energy or water treatment

326
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,900
facilities or things that are our

327
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,670
backbone to our infrastructure you're

328
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,920
definitely a subjected to attacks when

329
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,000
it comes to nation-states or looking at

330
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,610
if you do some sort of military

331
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,170
contracting medical research a lot of

332
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,540
those become big on the intellectual

333
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,550
property theft and your access to those

334
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,199
individual organizations whereas a lot

335
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,819
of companies really fit the bill more so

336
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,250
on organized crime and their

337
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,470
sophistication level varies based on the

338
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,450
energy verticals that you're in as well

339
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,980
so demographics play a very important

340
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,600
role around what you should be looking

341
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,310
at how you build your threat models and

342
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
really the defense's that you have in

343
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,140
your organization to try to combat a lot

344
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,360
of these different attacks as we look at

345
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,069
some examples of code execution there's

346
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,680
a free tool that I wrote called unicorn

347
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,030
and this uses PowerShell and have to

348
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,120
give a shout out to Matthew graver

349
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,400
because this technique

350
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,440
I use inside of unicorn was originally

351
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,689
discovered by Matthew Graber and what it

352
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,670
does is it allows you to take PowerShell

353
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,860
and allocate a certain portion of memory

354
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,150
an execute shellcode directly into

355
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,110
memory without ever touching disk so

356
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,730
that means you don't have to go and

357
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,320
download additional file you don't have

358
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,089
to go and download additional code you

359
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,520
can get older your code from essentially

360
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:32,320
a one line or PowerShell to execute on

361
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,970
the operating system itself and then

362
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
gain full access to it now what's

363
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,270
interesting is that Microsoft came out

364
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,319
with what's called the anti-malware scan

365
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:44,319
interface or the a MSI MSI is in Windows

366
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,700
10 above and what it does is it has it's

367
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,589
integrated into pretty much all of

368
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,460
Microsoft's main product lines they just

369
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,460
recently came out with a lot of

370
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,140
scripting languages office product lines

371
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,850
things like that and what it does is

372
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,980
there's what's essentially an MSI

373
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,810
provider and an a massage subscription

374
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,330
when a must I provider to be something

375
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,589
like Windows Defender other antivirus

376
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,440
products that are out there there's only

377
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,390
a handful that currently supports a MSI

378
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,430
integration for their product lines

379
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,800
themselves and what happens is is that

380
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,750
whoever you're a MSI provider is let's

381
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,339
just say it's Windows Defender what you

382
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,290
can do is let's just say you're about to

383
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,700
execute a PowerShell command and it's

384
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,890
heavily in code and actually we look at

385
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,720
this next next slide here the very top

386
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,850
one is what is being executed on the

387
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,070
computer so this is running PowerShell

388
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,839
it's a lot of endpoint detection

389
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,959
response tools use like that will look

390
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:35,230
for like - w1 - see but a lot of times

391
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,209
don't look for a four slash W or /c for

392
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,270
window one hide the window slash the

393
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,800
executed command and a lot a lot of EDR

394
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,260
as well also look for encoded command

395
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,140
which is a way of taking base64 encoded

396
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,330
code and executing it on the operating

397
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,480
system purely in memory now on the top

398
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,730
here we use what's basically a value to

399
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
string which allows us to say okay

400
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,779
reassemble in coda command down the road

401
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,029
and circumvents EDRs and execute our

402
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,520
base64 encoded strings without having to

403
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:04,630
worry about detection now with the

404
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,810
anti-malware scan interface which is

405
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,000
interesting is it has two two functions

406
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,439
that you can call you have a MSS gain

407
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,540
buffer and you have a messiah scan

408
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,220
string now Emma says scan buffer will

409
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,230
take an allocate a portion of memory and

410
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,860
scan that buffer space for malicious

411
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,900
activity

412
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,800
the MSS scan string will allow you to

413
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,640
submit a

414
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,949
value to the the a Masai engine and then

415
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,990
submit that to the a Masai provider

416
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,970
which does ends up being in this case in

417
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,709
our example when its defender and so

418
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,080
what will happen is the very top part if

419
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:37,268
you ran that through an anti-virus

420
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,950
engine nothing would pop up there would

421
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,600
not be any type of detection whatsoever

422
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,320
on that because it's using encoded

423
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,360
command obfuscation techniques and is

424
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,820
trying to escape the code itself but

425
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,829
what ends up happening below hand and in

426
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,050
what what is seen in the actual

427
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,489
PowerShell interpreter prior to actually

428
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,140
executing and what's actually being

429
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,209
executed on the underlying operating

430
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,670
system itself right before actual

431
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:02,739
execution this is what gets presented to

432
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,290
the MSI provider ie Windows Defender and

433
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,079
so if you look below you can see here

434
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,029
this is our essentially our raw code

435
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,829
right before it's about to be executed

436
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,269
and so what's interesting about that is

437
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:15,250
that we have a much better detection

438
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,130
criteria with Amos ID then we would

439
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,870
above however the problem is is that all

440
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,540
of these antivirus products are still

441
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,760
very much signature driven so though for

442
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,520
example with with Windows Defender

443
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,319
specifically they'll write a signature

444
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,089
updates for a unicorn quite frequently

445
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,980
and it's literally about three minutes

446
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:34,690
for me to write a bypass technique to

447
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,770
get around their signatures the

448
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,529
signatures are still very very

449
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:41,140
rudimentary very basic to put it in

450
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,450
perspective you can do substitutions for

451
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,339
example which will replace the zeros

452
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,839
with an @ sign and as a part of

453
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:49,390
execution and it'll go and actually run

454
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,760
those and so you can create variations

455
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,610
more polymorphic ways of getting around

456
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,040
this that aren't super complex or tough

457
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,110
you can even just XOR all this data and

458
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,089
it will get completely around their

459
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,470
detection criteria and so while Amos I

460
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,870
is very powerful the technology behind

461
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,540
it those providers are extremely basic

462
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,550
in nature in addition if you just take

463
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,680
substitutions or you use exhorting

464
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,660
instead of base64 encoding you won't

465
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,099
even recognize it as base64 encoded

466
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,959
strings and completely circumvent a

467
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,579
Massiah in the first place there's also

468
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,010
ways there's a number of techniques out

469
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:22,420
there today I know the the fine folks

470
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,699
over at cyber are published a paper

471
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,640
where you can manually patch offsets

472
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:29,740
with inside a Massiah dll that allow you

473
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,630
to essentially turn a masai off so it

474
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,949
doesn't even scan in the first place so

475
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,300
while there's a lot of great stuff in

476
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:36,760
PowerShell and

477
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,010
then built into Windows 10 above to get

478
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,780
around them is literally trivial for us

479
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,810
as attackers if we know what we're doing

480
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:46,030
and it's really not a substantial way to

481
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,290
protect against your infrastructure you

482
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,910
need to look more to indicator it's not

483
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,189
necessarily relying off of a specific

484
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,600
tool and and what I mean by that is it

485
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,310
literally takes us as attackers if we

486
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,250
know we're doing two to three minutes to

487
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,780
circumvent Windows Defender to get

488
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,400
around whatever that a maasai provider

489
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,290
is and allow us to execute code

490
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,939
unfiltered on the operating system

491
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,120
itself and so PowerShell is a good

492
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,800
example here for code execution so let's

493
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,700
talk about the the first method for

494
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,959
attack and that's really social

495
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,150
engineering this is one my favorite ones

496
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,890
to go and do social engineering is

497
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,780
really just about creating a fantasy

498
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,730
would you believe something that I'm

499
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,410
about to send to you and and if you

500
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,060
would what is my objectives as an

501
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,709
attacker so a lot of times I'll target

502
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,569
one or two people within the

503
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,610
organization with very specific pretext

504
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,440
or around the holiday time frames I love

505
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,700
giving gift cards it's funny about gift

506
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,750
cards is that some if you give them like

507
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
fifteen or twenty bucks

508
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,810
your percentage actually goes down than

509
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,210
if you're giving them five dollars

510
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,229
because of the believability factor so

511
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,570
my recommendation is if you're gonna

512
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,580
fish somebody with a with a gift card

513
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,890
obviously with permission and doing it

514
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,200
as part of your job then use it use a

515
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,340
lower amount of quantity for five bucks

516
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,650
and a lot of times what we'll do is um

517
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,060
much you use legitimate like Starbucks

518
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,920
gift cards or things like that that they

519
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,719
can use at the store so that we don't

520
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,430
trigger any alarms or trip up anybody so

521
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,440
by you know 100 bucks worth of gift

522
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,239
cards will target 50 people or 20 people

523
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,680
and we'll use that as our main method or

524
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,210
target only one or two people and

525
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,679
usually what it is is they have to log

526
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,360
into their system so we still use the

527
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,760
new password and we try some some form

528
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,260
of code execution to gain access to them

529
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,119
and social engineering really ends up

530
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,440
being still our primary method for

531
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,780
attack and what we see out there for

532
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,510
post compromised analysis where we see

533
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,619
most folks falling for some thing and

534
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,990
then from there using that as their main

535
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,030
way to get into the environments looking

536
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,800
at scams and ransomware around this time

537
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,540
of year we've seen a 317 percent

538
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,639
increase just from a binary or defense

539
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:34,720
perspective and this goes for phishing

540
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,040
campaigns online fraud coupon fraud are

541
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,780
you name it we're seeing a huge increase

542
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,389
right now around the holiday time frames

543
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,850
just because around that amount of spend

544
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,840
that is happening in general and talking

545
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,310
real quick about the business wire

546
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,740
frauds if you ever are subjected to

547
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,159
those where your organization falls prey

548
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,780
to

549
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,640
- that type of scam where someone

550
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,980
actually wires money work with your

551
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,570
local FBI office and within 72 hours if

552
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,039
you can notify them they can usually

553
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,870
recall that information almost

554
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,700
immediately recall that that money

555
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,129
almost immediately within a 72 hour

556
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,120
window but you do only have a 72-hour

557
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,950
window after that it becomes very

558
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,120
challenging to get that money back so

559
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,830
first and foremost if you're ready hit

560
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,559
with the business wire fraud notify the

561
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,449
FBI and come back from that side we're

562
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,980
also seeing is a selling of credentials

563
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,480
online to make a profit and what's

564
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,940
really interesting about organized crime

565
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,559
specifically this is a trend that has

566
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,539
been ticking upward and these specific

567
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,639
organized crime groups have been

568
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,049
maximizing their monetary gain for

569
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,760
compromising companies and what I mean

570
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,990
by that is that they'll start off with

571
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,100
something like a business wire frog

572
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,780
where they compromised an email address

573
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,309
but then they'll use that for post

574
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,750
compromising and then they'll use

575
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:36,370
ransomware deployment as a secondary

576
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,840
method so they can maximize business

577
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,549
wire fraud transfers once they get the

578
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,899
money from that hit them with ransomware

579
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,950
from there make as much money as

580
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,690
possible and after that sell the

581
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,429
credentials online and so making

582
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,590
multiple revenue streams from one

583
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,750
compromised is a new trend that we're

584
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,010
seeing just happening this year for a

585
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,390
lot of organized crime groups that are

586
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,250
really trying to get as much money as

587
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,780
they possibly can from a compromised

588
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,039
itself going and getting access data

589
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,480
encrypting and getting access to data

590
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,770
and song in underground market or

591
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,630
holding the company ransom for that type

592
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,639
of information those are all things that

593
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,110
we contain you see see out there and

594
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,720
just recently this was in in July

595
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,740
McAfee did a study on some dark web

596
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,770
analysis and showing that you know

597
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,600
they're one of the big things is

598
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,309
compromising week RDP credentials and a

599
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,719
lot of times will happen there is

600
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,668
they'll they'll they'll compromise a

601
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,679
company they'll do the business wire

602
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:22,750
fraud transfers they'll do all the other

603
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,159
ones but they'll use like the online

604
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,539
bitcoin mining ones where they're just

605
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,860
mining for bitcoins and things like that

606
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,299
from compromising those sell those once

607
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,158
they're done with those two other

608
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,200
individuals online and you can have

609
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,429
complete access to a vulnerable system

610
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,289
on the internet for as little as three

611
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,210
bucks a piece and so this is something

612
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:39,309
that we see definitely as an upper trend

613
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,289
of misconfigurations and obviously if

614
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,908
you're exposing a remote desktop from

615
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,470
the outside we have other challenges and

616
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:46,080
problems to talk about but just some of

617
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,120
the things that we're seeing out there -

618
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,309
on perimeter flaws if you look at just

619
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,840
patch management in general perimeter

620
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:53,918
flaws end up being some of the easiest

621
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,870
ways I've been getting - aside from

622
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,429
social engineering if you look at like

623
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,928
at the Equifax breach or nobody Ellen's

624
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,330
out there it was typically due to a

625
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,090
missing patch week credentials or ways

626
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,189
of being able to

627
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,539
numerate user accounts a lot of times

628
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,309
the ways that we'll get into a company

629
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,169
is will either use previously breached

630
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:12,770
data which we'll talk about here in just

631
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:15,080
a second or we'll find some sort of

632
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,789
metadata on the website one on one the

633
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,559
websites that enumerates their user ID

634
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,419
schemes so usually is like first that

635
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,940
last or some sort of incremental number

636
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,409
that we can guess and find a pattern in

637
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,900
and then from there we'll go to LinkedIn

638
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:28,640
scrape it scraped the sites for those

639
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,260
looking for different user names

640
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,490
associated with with weak passwords and

641
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,840
then from there run brute force accounts

642
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,940
and all we need to find is a response

643
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,399
code that gives us a success and a fail

644
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,620
oh and so if we can use OWA if we can

645
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:41,570
use a VPN concentrator or different

646
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,370
other methods those are all key things

647
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,080
that we key and use as attackers to

648
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,270
identify weak credentials and passwords

649
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,908
and so a lot of companies have have

650
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,779
invested into two-factor authentication

651
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,490
and what's interesting with two-factor

652
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,570
authentication is that there are good

653
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,190
ways to do two-factor authentication

654
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,230
there are bad ways to do two-factor

655
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,169
authentication and a lot of it come down

656
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,640
to you to would a user actually error or

657
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,080
would a user actually do something on

658
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,880
behalf of the company that can be

659
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,590
socially engineered around and so that's

660
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,940
where you look at it like where RSA was

661
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,320
original with the hardware tokens which

662
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,149
was a great practice you actually had to

663
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,590
have access to a hardware token you had

664
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:14,658
to enter in your information into the

665
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,279
site for your one-time pin in that pin

666
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:17,929
you know rotated as well same things

667
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:19,820
like Google Authenticator or duo

668
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,409
security have the same concept of

669
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,270
functionality where you have your habit

670
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:25,309
now installed on your phone and now you

671
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,690
have the ability to go back and enter in

672
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:28,370
that information back and forth in those

673
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,049
different areas there and so I think

674
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,520
with those those are all solid solutions

675
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,529
right let's bring in a randomized code

676
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,539
into your environments SMS is okay but

677
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,559
there's definitely a lot of ways that

678
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:38,510
especially now you're seeing a lot of

679
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,029
attacks starting to happen on SMS side I

680
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,408
think the risks that you have finet

681
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,789
still relatively low but the the

682
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,590
potential for something occurring via

683
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,629
SMS messages one-time pins is definitely

684
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,610
there and so typically will see three

685
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,490
variations of two-factor authentication

686
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,229
pin phone and push and so just to give

687
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,299
you a recent pen test that we did we're

688
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,409
able to find five user accounts that had

689
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:59,389
weak passwords and usually you could

690
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,890
take like the company name paired with

691
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,600
the year and maybe throw an exclamation

692
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,429
point in there and you slowly brute

693
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,049
force all the user accounts over time

694
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,799
and only doing that one or two at a time

695
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:11,179
way to maybe an hour for the lockout

696
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,230
threshold to to be reset and not

697
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,030
actually locking out accounts but the

698
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,960
timer for how many invalid attempts were

699
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,000
used

700
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,020
when you start to go go through and try

701
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,250
different user accounts as weak

702
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,650
passwords a lot of times we can find

703
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,460
quite a few users that have the local

704
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,920
sports team 2018 Summer 2018 winter 2018

705
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,400
password one you name it company name

706
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,690
2018 and in different iterations of

707
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,000
those and you can spend and we've

708
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,710
written tools that basically you you you

709
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,270
send it towards one of these devices and

710
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,160
it just sits and does all those

711
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,320
variations over time all automated and

712
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,660
just goes over a span of a few weeks or

713
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,360
months numerating as many user accounts

714
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,770
as we possibly can and so once we get

715
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,419
these user accounts a lot of times you

716
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,730
have to factor authentication especially

717
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,950
across your VPN concentrators especially

718
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,140
across your OWA instances or whether

719
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,360
you're leveraging office 365 and on this

720
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,460
recent Penta s we had five user accounts

721
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,189
and so what we did is we tried logging

722
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,380
in to five of those user accounts and on

723
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,060
the very fifth you can tell based on the

724
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,710
the responses that we were getting back

725
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,870
from the from the site itself we're

726
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,940
having a delay that delay was basically

727
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,709
sending a push notification to each one

728
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,570
of those five users and so the first one

729
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,850
hit deny we got an unauthorized access

730
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,810
second one hit deny third one hit deny

731
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,330
fourth one it denied

732
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,460
fifth one hit approve and when you look

733
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,159
at push notifications think about it

734
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,720
you have just say 10,000 users you give

735
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,460
them the ability to say hey am i logging

736
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,530
in from somewhere or not or am I not

737
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,730
and even though we obviously made the

738
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,860
location look like it was coming from

739
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,270
that location around where the

740
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,800
headquarters of that company was to at

741
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,480
least try to remove some some suspect

742
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,399
ability around the geolocation where as

743
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,080
occurring from and so what are you gonna

744
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,280
do in that situation when your user well

745
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,990
hey I'm probably logging in from

746
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,030
somewhere so they hit a proof which

747
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,380
allowed us access into the VPN and then

748
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,639
from there to try to attack the

749
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,410
organization in number of different ways

750
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,330
we find this pretty much on every single

751
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,350
penetration test that we do or if you're

752
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,449
leveraging something like push

753
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,980
notifications it's really detrimental to

754
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,780
the security itself because users have

755
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,880
the ability to error it's not like a PIN

756
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,020
number you're answering into the site to

757
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,510
be able to do it and obviously this is a

758
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,770
decision for ease of use and something

759
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,240
that you want your users to be able to

760
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,470
do security shouldn't be a major

761
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,390
hindrance in your organization

762
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,490
everything else at the same time this

763
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,390
specific type of technology is something

764
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,190
where there's a high level of

765
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,430
error-prone a level error to do

766
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,620
something like that weak passwords still

767
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,600
to this day we pass what should should

768
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,399
go away in every way shape or form but

769
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,260
this makes our lives easier as attacker

770
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,280
when we finally passwords and a lot of

771
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,470
these will meet your password

772
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,080
requirement flex complexity is like if

773
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,060
you have you know Microsoft's password

774
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,960
complexity enabled you need was it two

775
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,080
or three out of the four so

776
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,180
capitalization and and and numbers can

777
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,770
substitute her and lowercase and

778
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,630
alphanumeric can substitute for that you

779
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,190
don't even need an exclamation point or

780
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,170
a special character so a lot of these

781
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,360
are ways for us to be able to identify

782
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,310
metadata out there use that information

783
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,260
then to attack an organization and get

784
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,909
access into an environment all things

785
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,140
that are definitely possible with us as

786
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,390
attackers and as we go through the

787
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,770
perimeter of your organization to find

788
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,010
that information out there and use that

789
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,389
against you to get access to it

790
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,520
we love breach data things like the

791
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,230
LinkedIn data breach for example doing

792
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,610
password analysis around that so what

793
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,380
you can do is take an analysis around

794
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,909
let's just say LinkedIn for example

795
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,380
compare that to the company name that

796
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,210
we're going after and then look for

797
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,940
patterns of passwords in there like for

798
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,730
example did they use summer 2015 or so

799
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,710
snuggles 2015 and then just simply

800
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:31,700
changing that to snuggles 2018

801
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,320
would that work most humans definitely

802
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,330
have some sort of pattern that we can

803
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,590
use or if there's some sort of pattern

804
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,270
in the environment where they somehow

805
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,669
put in LinkedIn to the actual password

806
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,470
itself and so you you change the

807
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,240
LinkedIn to you whatever service that

808
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,100
you're trying to get access to those are

809
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,690
all things that that people will

810
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,850
typically err on and where passwords

811
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,700
really still to this day become major

812
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,899
weak points for us in organizations and

813
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,840
so let's talk about some steps to

814
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,880
success social engineering really comes

815
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,209
down to you education and awareness and

816
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,340
really having the ability to have people

817
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,540
that have a good understanding around

818
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,770
what's possible often they're not trying

819
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,020
to make security experts of everybody

820
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,240
that's not possible but what is possible

821
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,220
is giving them some information that if

822
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,810
if they see something unusual or weird

823
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,580
they have the ability to report that and

824
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,960
know where to go to to report that and

825
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,040
it's not it's not going to mean that

826
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,220
everything that you do is going to be

827
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,050
perfect it just means that that users

828
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,460
have a mechanism to report that they're

829
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,629
aware of the situations that around

830
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,370
their you're trying to change their

831
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,800
patterns of behavior that's where we see

832
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,479
continual education awareness phishing

833
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,040
campaigns that go to websites that have

834
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,410
better education around that instead of

835
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,450
just trying to own somebody and and

836
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,070
helping work people through different

837
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,110
issues around what's fake and what's not

838
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,820
it definitely has a major impact

839
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,010
companies I mean companies that we do

840
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,178
penetration test for and we do social

841
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,649
engineering and phishing campaigns

842
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,940
against them companies that have

843
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,039
education whereas we definitely see a

844
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,899
percentage drop but most importantly on

845
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,820
that percentage shock we see healthy

846
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:57,320
communication around detecting those

847
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,939
breaches as they're occurring easy even

848
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,279
if we're going after one or two or three

849
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,899
people um have a much higher probability

850
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,580
of people reporting that as being

851
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:07,370
potentially suspicious than anything

852
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,260
else second Network segmentation is huge

853
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,729
companies still don't focus on this and

854
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,769
I don't understand why I understand it's

855
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,909
a big undertaking but even doing simple

856
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:15,830
things like putting your Windows

857
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:17,659
Firewall on in your environment so that

858
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,230
workstation or workstation communication

859
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:19,970
can't happen

860
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,440
put your firewalls your what your

861
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,789
built-in windows firewalls that you use

862
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,460
on an everyday basis or that you have

863
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,139
disabled put that on don't allow

864
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,669
workstation or workstation communication

865
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:30,229
if you have to do some remote

866
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:31,490
maintenance there are group policy

867
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,190
settings you can put in place to allow

868
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,809
exceptions to certain subnet ranges that

869
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,149
maybe you have your IT Help Desk your

870
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:39,559
you know folks working on that can still

871
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:40,760
remote into those devices but still

872
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,918
block workstation or workstation

873
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,210
communication one of the biggest risks

874
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:45,889
that we face today is is lateral

875
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,200
movement the ability to compromise one

876
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:50,389
system use information off of one system

877
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,429
to get access to multiple of the systems

878
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:53,809
out there today and really today that's

879
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:55,820
that's the main method that attackers

880
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,620
are using view segments or network

881
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,149
appropriately where workstations and

882
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,229
servers are limited and on ports and

883
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:01,850
protocols and you don't allow

884
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,980
workstation or worst entry communication

885
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,689
it starts to become very challenging for

886
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,220
an attacker to break out of that and use

887
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,779
it and hopefully those alarms are

888
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,789
becoming much louder from a detection

889
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:12,620
standpoint you can actually do that

890
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,149
versus four years ago or six months ago

891
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,018
or versus a year that a breach has been

892
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:16,789
in your environment

893
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:19,130
to be able to really respond to those

894
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:21,080
much quicker than having an attacker

895
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,789
have full access to your environment and

896
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,889
all your intellectual property within a

897
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:26,990
few minutes or a few days and so along

898
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:29,029
with that comes being more proactive on

899
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,070
detection if you've heard the term

900
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:32,990
threat hunting threat hunting is is

901
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,340
basically using forensics but more

902
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,289
proactively if you look at traditional

903
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,699
security operation centers what would

904
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:39,200
happen with security operation centers

905
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,970
is you wait for an alarm to come up and

906
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,929
once the alarm came up you'd see whether

907
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,159
or not some alicia's and a large

908
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,690
percentage of those typically are false

909
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,370
positives and then from there you'd

910
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,480
respond to those alarms with threat

911
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,340
hunting you're becoming much more

912
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,779
proactive in looking for weird patterns

913
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,549
of behavior you're going out looking at

914
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:54,529
all command line arguments being use

915
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:55,789
like a good example if I compromised an

916
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,960
organization I

917
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,519
access to their environment the first

918
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,139
thing I'd typically do is I drop down to

919
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,779
a command prompt suspicious thing there

920
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:04,189
and I usually try to identify who's part

921
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,840
of specific groups and users like for

922
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,690
example using like the net groups

923
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,830
command to look at domain and what users

924
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,479
have access to the domain administrator

925
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,699
groups or what access have to web

926
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:14,989
applications or sequel services looking

927
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,159
for those commands can be a great

928
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,539
indication in your environment that

929
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,580
something's amiss because that is not a

930
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,899
common thing that Bob and sales but

931
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,418
typically do I can't imagine Bob and

932
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:24,889
sales dropping down to a command shell

933
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:26,749
executing net group commands looking for

934
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,799
specific things and so going through and

935
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:29,809
being more proactive looking at

936
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,759
PowerShell commands system on which is a

937
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,320
free tool from Microsoft is a fantastic

938
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,210
resource to getting more visibility into

939
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,580
your environments looking at DNS traffic

940
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,869
looking for time intervals for beacons

941
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,960
around command control infrastructure

942
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:43,009
looking for dynamic DNS instances those

943
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,119
are all things that can be possible

944
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:47,210
lateral movement another great example

945
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,099
an event log ID 46:24 originating from a

946
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,590
workstation IP address workstation IP

947
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:53,570
address or hostname with an L with a

948
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,129
login type of three that means that

949
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,658
somebody's remotely logging in from a

950
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:59,599
workstation or station communication

951
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:00,739
standpoint on on the network using some

952
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,789
sort of account and you can you know

953
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,379
look at that account say okay well I'm

954
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:05,419
gonna look at administrators or things

955
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:07,219
like that and you can usually see

956
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:09,379
workstation workstation communication

957
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,539
that way in general lateral movement in

958
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:12,978
your environment again all things that

959
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:15,109
we can do very quickly from from a

960
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:17,059
detection standpoint and it give us a

961
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:18,710
high probability of detection by going

962
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,049
more proactive and that's really where

963
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,940
as an industry we have to really shift

964
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,340
towards we can't just use it a checklist

965
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,899
of of common attack cycles run that

966
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,309
through as an automation tool and then

967
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:30,559
see what the Texans we have we actually

968
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:32,720
have to simulate those use them through

969
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,678
and and try to detect those as we're

970
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
going along and looking being more

971
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,820
proactive around very specific edge

972
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,409
cases I'm a huge fan of the mitre attack

973
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,840
framework I think it's a fantastic

974
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:43,999
resource to to do simulations but people

975
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,199
are basically using it as a checklist to

976
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:46,460
see whether or not they have detection

977
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,899
and getting around those becomes

978
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,849
extremely trivial I've gone into so many

979
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:51,018
companies leveraging mitre as their base

980
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,519
framework and they don't have any

981
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:54,109
detection criteria anything that we're

982
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,299
doing because we manipulated or changed

983
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:58,158
it in just a little tiny way that's out

984
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:01,009
there and and so leveraging mitre more

985
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,779
so for a understanding around different

986
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,249
attack avenues and simulating better

987
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:06,710
looking more at the behavior of what's

988
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:08,210
occurring is much more desirable and in

989
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,560
that last bullet point there do regular

990
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,760
users actually need power

991
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,379
the first way I'm not talking about your

992
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,420
web developers that might need access to

993
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,590
it or your administrators but do regular

994
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,650
users actually need to access the

995
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,389
powershell step 2 patch management still

996
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,070
to this day patching is is one of the

997
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,720
most highest probability of likelihoods

998
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,250
that we're seeing out there a lot of

999
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,840
times we see a like a patch that's that

1000
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,370
six months or older from a CVE

1001
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,840
perspective that attackers used to

1002
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,330
exploit and gain access to the systems

1003
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,060
and so just doing basic patch management

1004
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,409
removing known attack methods that

1005
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,399
attackers use on a regular basis or

1006
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,560
known exploits that are out there in the

1007
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,880
wild are ways that we can use that out

1008
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,520
and if you can't if you're if you're not

1009
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,960
in a position in in your company to have

1010
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,560
good patch management you absolutely

1011
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,660
have to have detection in place as a

1012
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,800
mitigating control to really fix a lot

1013
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,030
of those issues around detection

1014
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,129
criterias that you have so a patch patch

1015
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,330
patch patch patch I know everybody says

1016
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,370
it and everybody's tired of hearing

1017
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,870
units and super pain do you have to get

1018
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,489
better at patch management and just as

1019
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,479
an industry alone to get better with the

1020
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,480
code that we're seeing out there today

1021
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,700
and step3 continual testing really

1022
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,850
really important your goal you know most

1023
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,320
organizations is really focusing on on

1024
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,610
penetration testing and what happens out

1025
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,590
of penetration testing you take those

1026
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,449
results you try to build those fixes in

1027
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,740
both technical and strategic to say okay

1028
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,330
well in the future we're gonna try to

1029
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,680
get better at this and eventually

1030
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,540
getting more towards red teaming which

1031
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,100
is more simulations against your

1032
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,409
organization building around threat

1033
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,209
models and trying to simulate those

1034
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,380
those capabilities of an attacker to see

1035
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,810
how well you do in each of the stages

1036
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,130
and that leads directly into what we

1037
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,110
call purple teaming which is red and

1038
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,880
blue working together more of that

1039
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,889
collaboration front to work as one

1040
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,540
another to help each other and I think

1041
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,070
from a purple teaming perspective it's

1042
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,750
really important to understand that our

1043
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,070
goal in security is not to own

1044
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,390
everything and destroy everything and

1045
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,830
they make us look good as a red teaming

1046
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,780
perspective it's to make the

1047
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,010
organization to get to get better for us

1048
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,080
to get better as a red teaming for them

1049
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,780
to get better on the defense as well and

1050
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,639
the only way they've ever seen companies

1051
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,680
get better on this ball from a detection

1052
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,930
prevention and and a response

1053
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,610
perspective is going through these

1054
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,380
collaborative exercises with one another

1055
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,209
you have to do it I think Santa would

1056
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,010
agree that working with the elves on a

1057
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,560
regular basis and giving them education

1058
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,420
have them understand what's occurring

1059
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,770
out there makes the organization much

1060
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,990
better as a whole and in protects

1061
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,850
Banda's environment in a very different

1062
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,280
different way also investing in the

1063
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,419
right people people is most important we

1064
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,920
see up to today technology

1065
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,850
not there's products out there that's

1066
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:32,840
out you know 99.5% prevention and 100%

1067
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,040
detection last 99.5% prevention in 100%

1068
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,449
detection under things that they know

1069
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,370
about the things that they've written

1070
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,720
signatures for if you manipulate or

1071
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,129
change those in any way shape or form

1072
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,570
you completely circumvent their product

1073
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,060
it's not the technology the technology

1074
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,379
might be decent but having the people

1075
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,510
that understand the technology and to

1076
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,310
make the technology better it's really

1077
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,510
what you want to focus on and so going

1078
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,800
and buying all the latest greatest

1079
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,330
blinking boxes and everything else

1080
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,040
that's out to today does it make you

1081
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,810
more secure it's investing in the right

1082
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,580
people having teamwork having a

1083
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:01,040
collaboration and positivity within your

1084
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,710
team being excited about what you do all

1085
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,090
that goes a long ways password

1086
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,680
management is obviously another major

1087
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,989
concern for organizations a passion just

1088
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,090
need to go away period but giving the

1089
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,979
ability for users to error they will and

1090
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,390
so you have user accounts frequently in

1091
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,190
the environment that have bad passwords

1092
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,870
don't allow them to also do something

1093
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,490
like rush notification as well those are

1094
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,569
all things that that can make it much

1095
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,310
more difficult for you in your

1096
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,650
environments one thing I'll leave with

1097
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,759
as well on this is that if you look at a

1098
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,310
lot of the guidelines are coming now

1099
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,490
from Microsoft with NIST they state that

1100
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,739
you use a much longer password for then

1101
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:35,870
having the history the the reset time

1102
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:38,600
frame much longer so instead of doing

1103
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,969
this a 90 days you have a 20 character

1104
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,080
password or a 15 character password for

1105
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:44,810
six months because cryptic

1106
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,969
cryptographically in order to actually

1107
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,969
crack like hash values for example that

1108
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:51,620
that computation space should take much

1109
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,939
larger to do than the time period that

1110
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,350
you have out there but what's

1111
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,389
interesting about that dilemma and I'm

1112
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:59,000
not a huge fan of this at all is that

1113
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:01,700
most of the passwords that we see get

1114
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,470
compromised are due to phishing so what

1115
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,419
happens is that a user enters in their

1116
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,520
credentials which might be 15 characters

1117
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,140
or 20 characters now that password is

1118
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,900
compromised from a much longer time

1119
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,490
period so having a larger time period

1120
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,720
increases your exposure and time window

1121
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,490
that that password is valid in your

1122
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,439
environment having a less one reduces

1123
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,419
that time that's out there too so I'm

1124
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,790
not a huge fan of longer passwords with

1125
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,530
longer expiration periods I'm a much

1126
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,330
bigger fan of having complex passwords

1127
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,130
and having a shorter period that's out

1128
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,500
to today an interesting story actually

1129
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,290
cracked a 27 character password one time

1130
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,240
it was using rules within hash cat and

1131
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,250
the person's password was repetitive it

1132
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,049
was like meow meow meow meow meow

1133
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,120
you know exclamation point which is

1134
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,160
technically a complex password but it's

1135
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,720
repetitive and easy to crack just

1136
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,069
because the password is long doesn't

1137
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,419
mean that it's necessarily going to be

1138
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,000
something that we can't crack as an

1139
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,890
attacker that's out there and that's

1140
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,830
really it that's the main areas that you

1141
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:56,120
have to focus on going into 2019 and

1142
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,259
what we're seeing out there today as far

1143
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,330
as breach patterns that are out there

1144
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,070
most importantly I think it's it's it's

1145
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,270
safe to say that that there are ways of

1146
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,280
stopping these attacks that are out

1147
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,770
there and as companies continuously move

1148
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,750
forward and faster in technology in

1149
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,160
security we have to do the same thing we

1150
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,800
have to be able to meet the security

1151
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,330
requirements of the future by working

1152
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,010
with organizations and moving quick and

1153
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,330
having programs in place that can

1154
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,680
actually help those in just

1155
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,029
understanding the ways that attackers

1156
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,859
are going after your infrastructure and

1157
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,240
ways you can defend it allow you to

1158
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,350
build that strategy and help you build

1159
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,640
your threat modeling and in the

1160
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,040
defensive capabilities you have but most

1161
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,359
importantly the detection is out there 9

1162
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,220
times out of 10 the companies that we

1163
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,500
see that are working that that have a

1164
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,180
stronger security posture for us not to

1165
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,590
actually hit our companies that are

1166
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,759
continuously going through exercises

1167
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,630
that are building their strategy into

1168
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,730
their environment that aren't just

1169
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,840
sitting there waiting for the new attack

1170
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,190
to come on trying to figure out a way to

1171
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,740
get that signature built into their

1172
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:48,140
environment those are all things that I

1173
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,819
think are super important and out there

1174
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,009
for us to be able to do and as an

1175
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,680
industry going into 2019 we have to

1176
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,090
continue to educate our businesses folks

1177
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,319
that we're dealing with our families

1178
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,330
around things that they can do to

1179
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,740
protect themselves technology is going

1180
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,200
