1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
hey everyone welcome to Kringle Con i'm

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,870
heather mahalik and Sanna personally

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,300
invited me this year to do a talk on no

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,000
tooth it's all why building a solid

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,679
toolbox matters not sure if that means I

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,509
made the naughty list or the nice list

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,490
so you can decide for yourself based on

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,480
what I'm going to share with you during

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,220
this talk to just start monogamy may not

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,600
be the answer and this is one of the

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,630
hardest things that I find people have

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,369
they find one tool that they rely upon

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,650
to do all their forensic investigations

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,110
and while that's great and it may help

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,170
you you really need to understand where

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,210
is it lacking where may it back you into

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,230
a corner in your investigation the good

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,180
news is you don't have to break your

19
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,800
bank there are a lot of free solutions

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,350
that are going to exist I'm going to

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,349
show you during this short talk you also

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,640
have to be willing to test and maybe

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,890
break out of your comfort zone a little

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,719
bit and just try things that you may not

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,000
normally do and then every day

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,670
investigation one thing to consider is

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,469
what do you actually have time for you

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,650
are not going to have time to go file by

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,830
file and look at every single item in

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,689
your investigation so you need to decide

31
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,429
do your tools actually help you or are

32
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,740
they actually making your job harder I

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,049
hope it's not the latter but I find this

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,600
all the time to be honest I have a tool

35
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,909
that I use almost every single day and I

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,470
found a major bug in it this week which

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,930
is frightening so it's one of these

38
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,490
things of what do you do when your tools

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,369
fail you what do you do when they

40
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,079
contradict one another what happens when

41
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,759
the tool updates does it actually make

42
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,548
everything better or does it lose some

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,130
capability you have to even think about

44
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,380
the developers that work behind these

45
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,170
tools that we're using every single day

46
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,869
do they test the same things that you

47
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,259
rely upon in your investigations so you

48
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,700
need to be able to dig deep enough

49
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,780
understand what should be showing to you

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,930
in addition figure out can you say

51
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,180
exactly with 100% certainty where the

52
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,860
evidence came from if you can't that's

53
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,130
when it's time to dig you need to

54
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,680
understand what put the data there and

55
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,419
manually recover these artifacts the

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,550
worst thing you can do in your career is

57
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,880
knowing just enough to be dangerous and

58
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,700
I always say that jokingly but I've

59
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,760
with many people who I felt like would

60
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,369
speak the speak but then if they had to

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,510
actually do the actions they couldn't do

62
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,380
it so you don't want to have that

63
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,989
situation so Stannah here he wants me to

64
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,970
show you about the truth and we all know

65
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,360
Santa always knows the truth so the app

66
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,400
your app may actually know the truth

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
where everything else is getting wrong

68
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,540
so we want to do a really simple task

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,760
here we just have to prove that a call

70
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,640
was made on an Android all right that

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,799
can't be hard so we're gonna look the

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,399
call logs the call of interest is

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,370
supposed to be from January 17th 2018 if

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,700
we look closely here we only have calls

75
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,140
from July 18th 2017 so at this point

76
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,810
some people would be like it must not be

77
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,640
this Android and that's not true when we

78
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,090
look closely down here on the left we

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,049
see these custom and it says five I

80
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,670
hoped that this would pique your

81
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,650
interest if you're using a tool like

82
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,760
magnet axiom here to say wonder what's

83
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,340
in there so we're gonna peek in here we

84
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,250
have an app called silent circle silent

85
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,680
phone so I installed silent circle on

86
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,660
this device but it never activated it

87
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,910
would not work every time I tried to log

88
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,620
in it said I got a server error to me

89
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,370
that means the app was never used

90
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:37,370
however as you just saw it stole my call

91
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,770
logs I gave this application permission

92
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,360
to access my call logs and instead it's

93
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,340
like you know what I'm gonna keep them

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,810
all for myself so maybe this is like the

95
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,010
Grinch sneaking in and stealing

96
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,090
everything from our Co logs but this app

97
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,829
is telling you hey Heather

98
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,750
you keyword search for a phone number

99
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,540
and I know five things about that number

100
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,070
in a database called dialer isn't this

101
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,530
magical you would think that that's

102
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,510
probably call offs and guess what it

103
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,300
actually is so we have all this

104
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,829
information here this is where you may

105
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,620
have to just branch out a little bit

106
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,930
I wrote a simple query and as we see

107
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,820
here my query is saying exactly what I

108
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,470
want it to look like I'm how I want to

109
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,260
convert dates and times but do you

110
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,510
notice my comments I commented out times

111
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,940
use doesn't mean apples used last use

112
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,789
doesn't mean apples use and then up here

113
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,380
date time doesn't mean apples used the

114
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,630
reason I did that is I

115
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,050
never used this application to call

116
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,909
Kathy Bell however it took my

117
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,550
information stole it from my call log

118
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,670
and put it there in its own little

119
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,740
custom artifact so what you could do to

120
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,630
get back at Christmas is if you find

121
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,400
something cool like this put a link at

122
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,990
the bottom is for magnet forensics it's

123
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,090
a way for us to share artifacts like

124
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,980
this so everybody doesn't have to keep

125
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,530
digging through and doing harder work

126
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,050
like this we have to be realistic we all

127
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,179
want to press the button and have our Co

128
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,320
log show up right here but it doesn't

129
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,810
always happen so that's just a little

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,849
example for you there something else you

131
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,740
have to consider you've all these fancy

132
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,230
tools and you have all these cables and

133
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,080
your devices what happens if the data is

134
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,180
only in the cloud first thing you have

135
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,310
to consider is do you have authority

136
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,530
we're consent to login to cloud data you

137
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,970
cannot just go rogue and login and pull

138
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,099
things from the cloud they'll be very

139
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,390
Grinchy of you so do not do that and

140
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,090
don't say how to I told you to do that

141
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,849
because I did not these tools may

142
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,799
require a warrant number the other tools

143
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,720
should and I say should because they

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,270
don't all remind you that you need

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,010
proper authority the user is definitely

146
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,810
both going to be alerted so if you're

147
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,570
doing covert operations on behalf of

148
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,010
Santa you do not want to log into cloud

149
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,590
data because the user is going to get an

150
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,050
email be locked out for security reasons

151
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,270
force to reset a password you may have

152
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,610
two-factor authentication so there are

153
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,020
many things to consider and then the

154
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,880
final thing I want you to just think

155
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,580
about is not all cloud captures are the

156
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,659
same I'm an iPhone user Google will has

157
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,969
backup data for me

158
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,920
I don't backup to Google or so I would

159
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,350
think but I log into Chrome so really

160
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,540
I'm backing up to Google iCloud sync

161
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,130
data is different than iCloud backups so

162
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,140
there's all these differences on what

163
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,659
you have here um here's just a little

164
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,300
glimpse of I used Apple maps couldn't

165
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,490
find it on my device so this is my data

166
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,110
at rest on my phone and you can see my

167
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,510
history got Maps data is from eleven

168
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,060
seven twenty seventeen and that's old

169
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,230
that files not even in use anymore but

170
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,320
then I search for the most glorious

171
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,940
cheese steak in Philadelphia Jim's here

172
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,800
it is if you really want to Christmas

173
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,660
trinket get yourself one of those and

174
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,700
all that data was pulled from the cloud

175
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,200
so it may just exist there

176
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,820
you really have to branch out from our

177
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,310
everyday freezing world

178
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,060
here at the North Pole and go to cloud

179
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:49,460
to get our artifacts and in reality why

180
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,990
does this stuff happen why can't the

181
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,030
tools all get along and pull data from

182
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,920
Android and iPhone and really there's

183
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,840
just too much data there are so many

184
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,720
controls that the users can change on

185
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,119
their devices there are so many apps and

186
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,800
a lot of these apps why do the vendors

187
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,510
care about it I'd work the Starbucks

188
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,970
application once do you think any vendor

189
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,980
wants to parse Starbucks no they don't

190
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,500
I had to parse it for location artifacts

191
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:16,130
so it's just something to think about

192
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,720
what about OS updates they bother us and

193
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,250
they're annoying and they're exciting at

194
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,200
the same time but think about the

195
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,910
vendors how are they handling all of

196
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,630
this then there's mobile device

197
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,340
management

198
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,560
there's knowing how the data got there

199
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,260
to Google do it did happen to it did

200
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,980
Siri do it didn't Cortana do it Alexa so

201
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,380
there's all of these things knowing how

202
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,850
that artifact got onto your device being

203
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,219
creative and thinking about how you're

204
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,440
recovering it is key this is why we

205
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,480
can't really do automation and we need a

206
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,850
human that is not even smart enough in

207
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,530
that field just curious

208
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,600
curiosity is what's gonna save you in

209
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,250
smartphone forensics so if you don't

210
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,330
have time this is where you have to

211
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,660
decide what matters to you

212
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,950
my best advice to you is do not guest or

213
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,770
put something in a report and put your

214
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,229
name on it that is not a list you want

215
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,950
to be put on trust me so make sure you

216
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,960
take the effort to create test data

217
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,670
replicate ask for help reach out to

218
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,620
there's tons of listservs out there for

219
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,590
people doing mobile forensics and people

220
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,320
are really happy to help and on that

221
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,780
here is Santa on the right-hand side a

222
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,550
nice little icon for you and that's me

223
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,469
