1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,600
all right hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,599
elf university here for the second

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,080
Kringle Khan my name is Mark Baggett and

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,460
it is my distinct pleasure to be here to

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,650
present to you logs where we're going we

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,020
don't need logs so first thank you to

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,049
Santa Claus for having me back this is

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,330
such a wonderful event and how about

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,689
this new venue this is this amazing or

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,969
what so a little bit about me my name is

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,910
mark Baggett I do penetration testing

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,450
and incident consulting on the side when

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,730
I'm not teaching for sans or working for

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,219
the Department of Defense on a contract

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:50,099
to help our military the US military get

16
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:54,690
developed their cyber capabilities I'm

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,329
also the author of sans SEC 573 which is

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,070
automating information security with

19
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,539
Python you know we talk to the

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,010
leadership in the information security

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,159
industry oftentimes you'll hear them

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,320
talk about the three pivotal skills that

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,720
every information security professionals

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,490
and this is always being a systems

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
administrator of Linux and Windows and

26
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,919
knowing how to control those operating

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,380
systems knowing networking and how to to

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,330
interface with networks and set up

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,539
networks and monitor networks and that

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:31,380
third most pivotal skill is that ability

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,380
to build tools and SEC 573 is focused on

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,020
giving you those skills so enough about

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,439
that let's talk about what happens every

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,570
time I show up at a customer's site when

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,008
we're doing Incident Response you show

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,079
up there you talk to the customer you

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,930
say alright I understand you've been

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,649
compromised let me take a look at your

39
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,380
claw yet your logs and inevitably the

40
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,509
customers response is always less than

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,990
satisfactory right if they even have

42
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,090
logs to begin with when you get into the

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,820
logs you start looking and it's not

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,680
recording the artifacts that you need in

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,869
order to really understand what's going

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,630
on with this incident and I've had

47
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,640
incidents where I've shown up and the

48
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,530
there has no laws whatsoever to record

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,070
the connections coming in and out of the

50
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,870
organization they're not recording the

51
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,640
logon failures on their systems and

52
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,740
certainly they're not giving getting to

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,570
the level of detail that we'd really

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,940
like an incident management where

55
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,890
they're recording the processes that are

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,190
running on the hosts who's running those

57
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,779
processes and things like that so what

58
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,120
do you do in that situation we've shown

59
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,330
up you you know that they've been

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,310
compromised but there's just no logs in

61
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,600
place for you to really understand

62
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:51,690
what's going on what if we could go back

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,790
in time thirty days and from that point

64
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,800
in time start recording every process

65
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,440
that ran on every computer inside the

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,840
organization what if you could go back

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,160
in time and capture all of the network

68
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,900
profiles that were used so if they were

69
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,130
on the wired network it would tell you

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,660
if they were on a wireless network could

71
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,609
record the name of the wireless network

72
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,870
it would record those network

73
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,220
connections and how much data

74
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,630
transferred across them what if you

75
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,910
could go back in time and record the

76
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:20,340
SSID the user the user unique security

77
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,460
identifier the S ID that's associated

78
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,430
with every user that ran any process on

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,400
that computer what if you had a long

80
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,350
time machine what we really need we need

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,570
Doc Brown to come to the rescue

82
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,900
we need him to be able to take us back

83
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:40,859
in time by 30 days so that we can go and

84
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,959
enable logging in these hosts well where

85
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,720
we're going we don't need logs because

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,030
we do have a long time machine that is

87
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,220
now built into the Windows operating

88
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,580
system and we just need the ability to

89
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,560
access that data so with Doc Brown you

90
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,959
see is his control panel over there on

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,950
the Left Doc Brown always traveled in

92
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,459
increments of 30 years but his time

93
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,670
machine required 1.21 jigowatts in order

94
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,730
to travel back in time and activate that

95
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,910
flux capacitor on our windows systems we

96
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,279
have a simpler time machine and it shows

97
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,269
up on your task manager so when you do

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,890
that control hopefully we're going to

99
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,079
test me if you've got that application

100
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,969
history tab and on that application

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,159
history tab if you look at the top of it

102
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,190
you'll see resource you see

103
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,290
since and this is always 30 days in the

104
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:36,420
past of your current date and time so

105
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,590
the task manners manager is maintaining

106
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,230
a database where it keeps some

107
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,289
statistics about the applications that

108
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,060
have grown your host unfortunately when

109
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,800
you look at this thing in the task

110
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,660
manager app history it's very

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,910
underwhelming right the the statistics

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,010
that I see there well one it's only

113
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,410
showing me the Metro apps that I've got

114
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,320
on my Windows system right now who uses

115
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,700
these applications I don't see any of

116
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,520
the applications I use into the

117
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,990
information that's there well it's it's

118
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,729
not very helpful to me in an incident

119
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,130
response but the great news is that the

120
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,280
database that is in use by the

121
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,950
application history tab contains lots of

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,929
detailed information that is very useful

123
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,539
to us we just need the ability to get to

124
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,850
it so I'm going to introduce to you two

125
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,750
tools today that will let you get to

126
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,640
that information

127
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,620
and pull that information out so during

128
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,510
your next incident when the logs are

129
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,910
available you can go back and capture

130
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,130
all this information across every device

131
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,770
in your network the first one is rum-dum

132
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:38,010
strummed up when I wrote storm dump it

133
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,229
is intended for ease of use it's got a

134
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,360
nice graphical user interface you select

135
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,650
the database it'll automatically extract

136
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,780
the database which is locked by the

137
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,390
operating system make a copy of that

138
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,280
make a copy of your registry and then it

139
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,310
will analyze the database and export all

140
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,500
of the logs to an Excel spreadsheet with

141
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,970
multiple tabs so you'll have a tab for

142
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,520
each of the different tables that are

143
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,919
inside that's from database from

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,640
standing for systems resource

145
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,080
utilization management database this

146
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,789
tool is available in my github I'll show

147
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,349
it to you in just a second the other

148
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,630
tool I want to introduce to you is ESD

149
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,510
to CSV and it's the command line version

150
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,400
of srem dump and it's intended for mass

151
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,960
collection or i-tech I think can't use

152
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,870
this graphic user interface or reach out

153
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,700
to each computer my network but es UCSB

154
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,220
I can run it ups and sack or some other

155
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,650
type of process execution on every host

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,070
in my network and it will dump that

157
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,620
strum into CSV files I can choose to

158
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,510
dump a single file or all of the tables

159
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,940
that we have in the strum you can see

160
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,900
the CSV isn't limited to just the strum

161
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,060
database it can

162
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,919
dump any database that's in an ESC

163
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,090
format you've got lots of those on your

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,120
Windows system including the edge

165
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,090
browser history and other things any se2

166
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,509
csv works on a plugin extendable

167
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,479
architecture where you can have it dump

168
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,919
generic ESC databases and not do any

169
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,770
analysis on them or you can provide

170
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,659
these plugins where it will supplement

171
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,159
the data that it gets out of the

172
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,789
database with additional information

173
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,810
from Windows registry from online

174
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,090
resources and things like that

175
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,090
so let's just take a quick look at these

176
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,590
two tools from dump as I mentioned is

177
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,239
that ease of use tool it's got a nice

178
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,669
graphical user interface you can see

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,220
here on the left if you run strummed up

180
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,080
as an administrator then it'll be able

181
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,150
to acquire the locked files that are on

182
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,620
your operating system if you're not

183
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,260
going to run it as an administrator then

184
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,220
you need to be using a forensics image

185
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,229
of a hard drive where the SRU DVD file

186
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,240
is not locked by the operating system

187
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,080
but of course in an instant response the

188
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,389
easiest thing to do would be to

189
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,760
right-click on Shrum dump run it as an

190
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,240
administrator and then let it execute

191
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,770
now optionally you've got this software

192
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,479
hive if you provide it with the software

193
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,698
hive it's going to use that software

194
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,860
hive to look up the names of user

195
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,300
accounts so those user SIDS it's gonna

196
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,949
look busy up and the names of network

197
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,860
profiles that were used on the system

198
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,090
and finally it dumps everything to a big

199
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,970
spreadsheet let's take a quick look at

200
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,530
srem dump and what that looks like so

201
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,690
here i've got a copy of it first of all

202
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,179
i download this from my github so

203
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,430
github.com mark packets from dump i can

204
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,930
just click here download a zip file the

205
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,900
only two files that I really need are

206
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,479
strong dump dot exe or in this case from

207
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,669
dump 2 dot exe and this template the

208
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,400
template tells it what kind of files to

209
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,719
extract and other information looking at

210
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,138
the template here you can see that it's

211
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,080
got lots of information in it including

212
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:36,510
the names of the types of interfaces

213
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,339
SIDS so if you want to take the the SS

214
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,069
IDs that are known and associated with

215
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,930
your organization and plug those into

216
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,390
this database then it'll automatically

217
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,120
look up when it sees a particular SID it

218
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,459
will tie a user account to it so here we

219
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,800
got the names of the well-known SIDS

220
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,829
that are associated with the Windows

221
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,019
operating system

222
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,480
okay and what I'm gonna do is I'm just

223
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,310
gonna run strum dump - oops

224
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,630
I'm gonna clancer that I'm gonna right

225
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:08,079
click on it and run it as an

226
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:10,209
administrator and it pops up and thinks

227
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,399
um a second you keep going fire up this

228
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:14,140
graphical user interface and it asked me

229
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,910
to select the path to the DAT so I can

230
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,689
just browse out to C colon backslash

231
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:23,589
windows system32 SRU directory in here

232
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,360
ICS are you DB I'm gonna select that it

233
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:28,420
recognizes that that is the one that's

234
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,550
locked by the operating system and tells

235
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,319
me that I can either download F get Mint

236
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,290
manually extract it or I can click Auto

237
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,060
extract when I click Auto extract here

238
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,790
you can see in the command line it's

239
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,969
using the built-in utility es en tu til

240
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,469
to extract a copy of that and it's

241
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,720
extracting a copy of my software

242
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,720
registry hive and then it fills in these

243
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
fields with those values to pass to

244
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,519
those temporary copies of that but I can

245
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,589
click OK and then it begins analyzing

246
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,140
those files and dumping all of the

247
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,370
records out of those files so while

248
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,410
that's running in the background let me

249
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,240
go ahead and go to my pre-baked cake

250
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,310
over here where I've got an Excel

251
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,420
spreadsheet from a previous run of strum

252
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,800
dump and show you the kind of things

253
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,310
that we can get out of here

254
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,779
so you see multiple tabs here across the

255
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,609
bottom I've got an application resource

256
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,990
tab and network usage I'm gonna guess

257
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,360
that it's very difficult for you to see

258
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,310
this so I'm gonna zoom in on here so we

259
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,680
can take a look at some of these fields

260
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,319
a little bit more detail so you've got a

261
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,719
strum ID number this is just an internal

262
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,000
number of that record I've got the date

263
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,350
and time where this application was

264
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,750
running I got the name of the

265
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,910
application that ran I've got the user

266
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,470
Sid that ran this application the amount

267
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,930
of time it had in the foreground and

268
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,420
background so during an incident I can

269
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,099
go back here I can see this is on

270
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,270
September 10th from September 10th let's

271
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,670
go all the way to the bottom of my

272
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,380
spreadsheet here September 10th look at

273
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,719
all of this detail I'm still looking at

274
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:57,160
September 10 September September 10th

275
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,279
September 10th and let's just scroll to

276
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,829
the bottom of the spreadsheet here go

277
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:07,860
all the way to the bottom slide bar

278
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,660
up to eleven nine so I've got an entire

279
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,300
months worth of data and I can see the

280
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,910
names of every process that ran the name

281
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,859
of the user that ran that process and

282
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,480
the amount of time it had in the

283
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,780
foreground and background on my network

284
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,280
usage tab very similarly let's zoom in a

285
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,160
bit here so we can see the stuff a

286
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,160
little better I have the date and time

287
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,439
the application that ran these are just

288
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,250
the network the applications that used

289
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,730
the network so here I can see on

290
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,630
September 10th

291
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:43,080
I had excelled exe running on my system

292
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,540
and this was run under by the account

293
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,070
mark Baggett I can see the type of

294
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,930
interface it ran the name of the

295
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,270
wireless network that it was connected

296
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,979
to when it transferred this data I can

297
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,300
also see the amount of information that

298
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,360
was sent in the amount of information

299
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,400
that was received so I know the names of

300
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,170
the users that were on these systems I

301
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,390
know the names of the processes that

302
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,479
were run I know which networks they were

303
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,040
connected to and which how much data

304
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,260
they transferred across those networks

305
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,420
and I can retrieve all of this for every

306
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,040
process that's run on this computer for

307
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,870
the last 30 days now some of this goes

308
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,730
back longer than 30 days you got energy

309
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,190
usage where it required tells you how

310
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,320
much battery time is being used and so

311
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,630
forth we also have long term battery

312
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,820
usage here so it's a very useful tool

313
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,220
with lots of great information that you

314
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,830
can use to supplement your incident

315
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,570
response information or it can be the

316
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,860
source of all your instant response

317
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,470
information when you get to an

318
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,350
organization that doesn't have logs ESEE

319
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,500
to CSV is the command line version of

320
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,240
this so what ESC to CSV does is it does

321
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,780
the same thing it'll give us access to

322
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,100
these databases that are in there let me

323
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,920
just show you this a little bit from the

324
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:58,170
command line so here's my esc to csv

325
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:00,300
tool esc to CSV dot exe if I do it - eh

326
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,579
you can see that it's get gives me my

327
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,280
help I can list files that are on there

328
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,140
you can also acquire log live files on

329
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,089
this I can recursively search through

330
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,949
folders and things like that nor define

331
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,560
that file so this is good for just

332
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,570
forensics hunting expeditions so let's

333
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,339
just do this command here and take a

334
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,410
look see if I can find some you

335
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,290
seed databases that are on my system so

336
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,839
here I can see that I've got this PSE

337
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,829
database called qmg are right under

338
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,000
network download queue MGR and I did our

339
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,320
my command lines were our four

340
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,690
recursively go through the hard drive

341
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,280
and L to list the folders and underneath

342
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,350
that I can see that there's a messages

343
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,140
table process table a delivery table

344
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:43,280
they're all empty though see here I've

345
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:46,080
got a another file let's look at this

346
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,430
SMS interceptor let me just take this

347
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,450
entire path right here and let's just

348
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,050
take a look at what's in this database

349
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,900
so I can use ESC to CSV and I'm gonna do

350
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:01,859
a dash L to list the contents of that

351
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:04,319
file it reaches out to it and again this

352
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,000
is this one is empty here now what about

353
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,610
that queue manager let's go back and see

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,850
if we can grab a copy of that was my

355
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,530
path to that one again alright let's

356
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,480
just grab a copy of this queue manager

357
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:20,660
it looks like that one actually did have

358
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,660
some files in it in tables

359
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,240
to CSV - ill alright here I can see it's

360
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,219
got a couple of tables in it one's

361
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,649
called job one called Falls if I want to

362
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,860
dump those files what I can do is if I

363
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:37,110
just don't provide any arguments then

364
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:42,649
it's just gonna dump those files and

365
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:46,170
here if I do a dir Astra dot CSV or jobs

366
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:49,519
Maastricht dot CSV I can see there's a

367
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:53,009
copy of that jobs and files

368
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,980
that's CSV there's that file where it's

369
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:58,350
dumped both of those if I put a - a on

370
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,370
here it's gonna acquire lock files and

371
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:04,560
if I do a - P I can give it plugins in

372
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,970
order to have it process files now the

373
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,709
plugins that are available let me just

374
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,709
do a - lets see

375
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:23,189
CLS let's do it

376
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:25,769
ESC to CSV CSV - L or - P / - plugins on

377
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:28,319
the plugins expect an argument if you

378
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,790
just give it - P list it'll tell you the

379
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,949
names of the plugins that are available

380
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,050
right now I have a Spartan plug-in which

381
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:36,779
is used for processing ESC databases and

382
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,519
an SR you DB plug in either of these can

383
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,160
be used in order to dump file I have an

384
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,509
l2 list the folder extension and so back

385
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,069
to the PowerPoint presentation just to

386
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,019
show you a couple of quick command-line

387
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:48,180
argument examples so here we're going to

388
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,240
use ESC - CSB we're gonna tell it to use

389
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,439
this SRU DB plug-in we're gonna tell it

390
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,620
to list the tables that are available

391
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:57,059
inside of my shrum database and here you

392
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,949
can see the names of all of the

393
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,589
different tables that are available in

394
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:05,519
my Strohm database if i then decide to

395
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:08,819
dump a specific table and this schrum

396
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,129
database is locked by the operating

397
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,959
system well then I can use the - a for a

398
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,819
choir when I pass the command-line

399
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,160
arguments so here I'm running ESU to CSV

400
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:19,949
of telling it to a choir a locked copy

401
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,219
of this and use the schrum database

402
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:25,559
plug-in again to process this file if I

403
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,809
don't pass it any other arguments other

404
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:30,600
than acquire and use the strum dump it

405
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:32,699
dumps every single file that's in the

406
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,980
database so here when I do a dir you can

407
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,349
see I got a different CSV for

408
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,990
every table that existed inside of that

409
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,389
storm database if I wanted to dump a

410
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,940
specific table then what I could do is I

411
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,010
could use the dash D argument - D I can

412
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,139
give it the name of the table and it'll

413
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,449
just dump that one table now whenever

414
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,100
you use the dash D argument it expects

415
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:56,670
your table names to be separated by

416
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,649
spaces and the very last table name

417
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,019
should be a dash dash indicating you you

418
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,660
you're done giving it the names of all

419
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,490
the tables so you put all of the names

420
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,959
of the tables between dash D and the

421
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,000
dash dash argument and it'll go through

422
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,939
and dump each of those files one at a

423
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,650
time from the ESC database and then you

424
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,470
can pull these logs back centrally to

425
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,020
your location and begin processing those

426
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,059
as part of your incident so the next

427
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,000
time you're in an organization and they

428
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:26,220
tell you well we don't have logs or they

429
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,860
show you their pitiful excuse for logs

430
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,200
and you wish that you could just go back

431
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,959
in time and grab all of that information

432
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,450
up and begin processing it just remember

433
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,809
that you've got copies of scrum dump and

434
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,000
ESC to CSV that you can use to pull that

435
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,730
information historically again that

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,830
information is available on my github so

437
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,600
if you go out to github.com mark

438
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,970
baguettes rum dump you can download the

439
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,580
latest copy of storm dumped and

440
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:57,030
github.com mark bag at esc - analyst

441
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,559
you'll find a copy of es e to csv use

442
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,690
these in your next instant response send

443
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,970
me an email let me know how they're

444

working for you once again thank you for

445
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,600
coming out to Kringle Con thank you for

446
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,780
your time and enjoy the rest of the

447
