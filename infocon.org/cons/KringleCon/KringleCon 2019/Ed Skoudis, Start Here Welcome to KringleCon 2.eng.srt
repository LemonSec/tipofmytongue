hello and welcome to the sands holiday

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,980
hat challenge 2019 my name is Ed SCOTUS

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,750
and I'm the director of cyber ranges

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,780

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,990
here to welcome you to Kringle con two

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,669
turtledoves but first off I'd like to

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,349
tell you how I got to the North Pole I

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,490
was talking with Santa Claus and I said

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,740
how am I going to get to the North Pole

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,359
this year and he looked at me like the

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,889
answer was obvious he said you just

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,960
start driving north on the New Jersey

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,149
Turnpike and magic will happen and

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,739
you'll be here and so I hopped in my car

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,870
and I started driving north on the New

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,800
Jersey Turnpike and suddenly Here I am

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,828

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,039

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,169

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,530
underway and I want to tell you about

25

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,470

45
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,659

46
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,670
this year Santa Claus sat down with the

47
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,880
elves and said what's the biggest venue

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,100

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,000
the holiday season happens in elf

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,130
University so Santa said hey can we host

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,900
it there we talked with the faculty and

59
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,190
staff of elf University of course

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,080
they're very fond of Santa Claus and

61
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,109
they gave us permission to host the

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,040
event and elf knew yes that's the good

63
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,410
news but here something has come up the

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,560
whole theme of this year's Kringle con

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,240
is well Kringle can't two turtledoves so

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,850
we have these mascots there are these

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,740
wonderful turtle doves but they're

68
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,570
missing in fact Santa Claus was

69
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,940
considering canceling the conference

70
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,829
because the mascots have gone missing

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,109
but I tell you the elves said we can't

72
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,240
cancel this we've got so many speakers

73
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,310
lined up I mean really amazing speakers

74
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,920
we've got these great challenges just so

75
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,630
much fun in store and in fact the elf

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,670
said why don't we not cancel a

77
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,760
conference in fact we can ask the

78
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,160
conference attendees to help us find the

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,810
turtle doves now Santa was still kind of

80
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,290
concerned here he thinks it's a disaster

81
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,060
in the making

82
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,489
I mean turtle doves don't just wander

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,100
off maybe somebody kidnapped them the

84
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,980
point is we need your help in finding

85
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,170
the turtle doves Santa is asking you

86
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,209
personally help find the turtle doves

87
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,190
they're somewhere at the North Pole we

88
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,100
believe they're at elf University but

89
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,170
you need to explore and find them also

90
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,570
as you do so you might find that there's

91
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,280
some additional nefarious activities

92
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,829
happening at the North Pole you need to

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,410
look into those so help find our dear

94
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,410
turtle doves and solve the mystery of

95
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,640
why they're missing now as you do this

96
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,280

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,899

bushy evergreen and the elves are

112
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,298
standing next to terminals and those

113
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,940
terminals are ways that you can help an

114
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,669
elf solve a problem and get some hints

115

to address that so as you're jumping

116

121

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,500
Kringle Khan - now there's two different

127
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,210
kinds of challenges that you're gonna be

128
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,040
faced as you work your way through the

129
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,530
holiday hack challenge and try to find

130
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,840
those turtledoves and help the elves the

131
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,169
two kinds of challenges our objectives

132
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,119
and terminal challenges the objectives

133
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,070
are really what makes the holiday hack

134
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,290
challenge itself they're all displayed

135
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,510
in your badge as they open up you need

136
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,610
to solve these objectives to unravel the

137
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,370
mystery and as you unravel the mystery

138
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,020
you'll see but you're helping to save

139
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,290
the whole holiday season from

140
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,060
destruction there's an affair II as'

141
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,470
villainous evil attacker that's the

142
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,360
worst kind of attacker you can have the

143
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,580
nefarious villus villainous and evil

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,240
kind you need to figure out who that is

145
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,060
and Swart a disaster that's the

146
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,090
objectives themselves but for hints on

147
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,280
the objectives you can help an elf solve

148
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,630
a terminal challenge the terminal

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,039
challenges are all designed so that you

150
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,920
click on them and you pop open in your

151
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,600
browser and then they require a short

152
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,180
period of time for you to answer them

153
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,680
within the browser itself now that short

154
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,480
period of time might be 5 minutes or 10

155
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,400
minutes or 15 minutes or maybe even an

156
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,230
hour depending on your skill level but

157
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,599
the terminal challenges are designed as

158
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,940
a sort of little bite-sized chunks of

159
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,330
you help an elf solve a problem when you

160
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,969
do the elf will then give you hints for

161
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,740
an Associated objective and in your

162
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,400
badge if you look at the objective it

163
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,640
tells you which elf to seek out to find

164
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,250
and then help to get hints for achieving

165
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,020
that objective it's a beautiful thing

166
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,760
so objectives are which I ultimately

167
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,979

168
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,780
objectives help an elf solve a terminal

169
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,020
challenge and that elf will give you

170
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,849
hints now what else can you do at Craig
