1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,430
hello and welcome to Kringle Con thanks

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,099
so much for coming to this talk Web Apps

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,570
a trailhead because Web Apps are really

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,610
that they're the beginning of a journey

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,200
just like those first few steps out of

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,660
your door you never know where a web app

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,789
will take you my name is Chris LG I work

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,460
for counter hack challenges I primarily

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,279
build challenges and also I like

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,099
breaking things I'm I'm a pen tester and

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,170
I teach pen testing for sans and and

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,470
there'll be some some pen tester style

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,660
to how we talk through web apps today

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,850
and specifically the three things we

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,309
really want to hit are the HTTP

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,500
communications that web apps use like

17
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,019
between browser and web server I want to

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,700
talk about parameters being in the URL

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,890
or the address bar and also in the post

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,870
body and then we'll also talk about

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:54,090
server side and client side code and web

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,410
apps are all around us if you've been on

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,140
the internet for more than a day you

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,500
have definitely interacted with web

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,539
applications and when we think of a

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,549
classic web app we think of something

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,680
like here on the left here we've got

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,750
this this online learning portal where

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,549
you register for classes and and it

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,950
feeds you video content you take quizzes

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,439
you chat with with subject matter

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,960
experts and and absolutely that is a web

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,419
app but even much much simpler things if

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,059
you if you log into your towns website

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,820
to check you know property taxes or the

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,110
the merriment forecast for next week

37
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,929
even though it's much simpler that's

38
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,610
still a web application there are still

39
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,340
processes and decisions being made in

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,890
the web server that drive the content

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,020
that you see in your web browser now at

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,030
the same time along with these kind of

43
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,610
classic browser-based Web Apps we also

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,549
have all the mobile apps that that are

45
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,200
or almost just skins for for browsers

46
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,290
right a lot of a lot of apps and here's

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,640
a screenshot on the right of my phone

48
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,030
and some of the apps I have installed on

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,409
my mobile device a lot of these are just

50
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,770
trimmed down web browsers that browse a

51
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,570
specific page with you know maybe fewer

52
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,908
and you know options and and and frills

53
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,090
that we see in a web browser and even

54
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,950
the ones that are fancier that are 3d

55
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,060
multiplayer you know lights and sound

56
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,970
and vibration a lot of

57
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,040
apps are really speaking HTTP in the

58
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,750
background so they look like you know

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,120
this is a specialized program but it's

60
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,540
really in the in the backend acting like

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,110
a web app and that background HTTP looks

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,000
like this right it's it's a get request

63
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,610
when you go to your web browser and you

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,349
type in WWE elk on comm it's a get

65
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,390
request and then instead of all this

66
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,700
it'll just be get slash and then HTTP

67
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,559
1.1 by the way these examples are in

68
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,660
this version of HTTP

69
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,989
if you curious about the more modern

70
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,480
HTTP 2 you can go actually go back to a

71
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,180
talk chris davis and i did last year on

72
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,069
HTTP 2 and that's still on the north

73
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,019
pole server so feel free to review that

74
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,790
but it's not as good for kind of

75
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,190
analyzing what's going on because it's

76
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,989
not plaintext like we see in one that

77
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,670
one so so here's a get request is where

78
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,010
my browser says hey I need this web web

79
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,819
page and then the server responds with

80
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,790
something like this 200 ok so not a 404

81
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,950
I couldn't find it not a 501 something's

82
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,230
broken but a 200

83
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,399
here's your webpage and then you know it

84
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,140
gives a bunch of other stuff here a

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,510
bunch of kind of security headers and

86
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,798
and the good old cookie hand what should

87
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,370
update your cookie with this value and

88
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,160
that's great and then there's this HTML

89
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,000
and that's where where the page that

90
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,079
we're going to view gets passed back and

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,910
we'll look at that in just a second but

92
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:40,989
I want to draw your attention to this

93
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,060
piece right here here we have in the in

94
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,380
the URL as part of what you'd see in the

95
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,989
address bar at the top of the browser

96
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,639
you see an option so it's it's the the

97
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,500
page we want to see and then and then a

98
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,750
slash and a question mark and then

99
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,079
course course is the name of a variable

100
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,780
and equals Pak Pak is the value that

101
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,819
that the browser is asking to get in

102
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,500
that variable so you might see this on

103
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,600
like a like an online retailer where

104
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,069
you'll see you know a long web address

105
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,280
and a slash and then question mark and

106
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,750
then like SKU equals in some number and

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,880
then it's showing you that particular

108
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,069
SKU that particular item number and

109
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,608
that's that's just passing in the

110
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,769
address bar this particular parameter

111
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,840
now if we if we want it to be a little

112
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,599
less obvious to the user what's going on

113
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,979
we can use a post request so it's again

114
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,260
something the browser does but instead

115
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,780
get it's just a different verb it's post

116
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,490
and it's posting to a page and here

117
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,950
instead of anything after this this

118
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,010
trailing slash here all the parameters

119
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,349
are down here in the bottom there in the

120
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,730
post body so they can't be modified by

121
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,130
the user just by clicking in the address

122
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,650
bar and changing things but it's still

123
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,880
data that is coming from the client that

124
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,590
we as as enthusiasts as hackers pen

125
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,469
testers or whatever that we can

126
00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:01,719
manipulate and send to the server for it

127
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:03,280
to then give us back some HTML now HTML

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,140
what does that look like if you've never

129
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,500
done this I encourage you to go to a web

130
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,360
page any web page right click and pick

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,580
view page source and you'll see stuff

132
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,800
like this you'll see tags with angle

133
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,599
brackets and and this is setting a

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,430
header lfyou course registration and

135
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,110
then you'll see you know tags like this

136
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,880
script and this is where we see a bunch

137
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,960
of JavaScript this particular code

138
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,420
actually runs the the elf view the the

139
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,770
library that the book store code and it

140
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,160
helps our browser figure out when to

141
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,810
show how much window update you know the

142
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,420
amount of money we've spent or we're

143
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,010
gonna spend to update the you know how

144
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,430
much money we have left and that's all

145
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,900
great that's all on the all on the front

146
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,340
it's all in the browser it's all in the

147
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,620
client it's stuff that we can see

148
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,359
manipulate so if we want this this web

149
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,730
page just show us something a little

150
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,390
different we can modify this code in our

151
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:58,320
browser and see it a different way

152
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:01,270
conversely let me grab a pen here

153
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,060
back-end code so code at the server

154
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,219
server-side processed code looks might

155
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,130
look like this this is some web code

156
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:13,360
written in Python a lot of web code is

157
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:16,719
written in you know dotnet or in Perl or

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,230
PHP or whatever I like Python because

159
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,490
it's it's relatively easy to use and

160
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,190
especially if you want to teach your

161
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,930
kids to code my son Josh loves doing a

162
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,930
little bit of Python now and again and

163
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,600
we can use it with with libraries like

164
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,550
flask and Django and cherry pie to

165
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,770
actually make it run a web page so this

166
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,470
specific function here does a bit of

167
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,060
HTML escaping and that's just where you

168
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,560
know when I as a pen tester I'm looking

169
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,900
for some

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,370
like sequel injection I might use the

171
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,760
good old-fashioned single quote

172
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,130
character to to try to insert some

173
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,130
sequel statements or portions of a

174
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,020
statement into a web app maybe if I'm

175
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,219
looking for HTML injection or some kind

176
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,099
of cross-site scripting attack I might

177
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,350
use these angle brackets to insert my

178
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,410
own code into you know what's what's

179
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,830
going to be handled by my system and

180
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,600
other systems and this function here

181
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,330
invisible to the user just takes these

182
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,700
kind of dangerous characters and sort of

183
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,180
nerfs them into just HTML escape

184
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,620
characters so rather than passing a raw

185
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,919
less-than symbol in the past this

186
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:27,300
ampersand LT semicolon which which won't

187
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,590
execute as code in in a browser

188
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,700
there are lots of other functions that

189
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,859
can happen on the back end certainly

190
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,110
pulling in video or are enabling a chat

191
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,570
with somebody else here's a function

192
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,610
that does some some hashing so maybe

193
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,930
we've got some some parameters we've

194
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,280
passed to the client and then the

195
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,780
clients going to make some decisions and

196
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,669
then pass them back we want to make sure

197
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,799
they haven't changed certain things so

198
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:49,380
we might use you know in this case a

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,300
hash to to verify the integrity of the

200
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,380
information they're passing back so all

201
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,930
kinds of stuff can happen on the front

202
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,700
and back but we need to make sure that

203
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,530
anything that important that happens in

204
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,390
terms of processing is done on the

205
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,640
server side because the client has much

206
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,880
much less control over how things are

207
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,370
processed on the server side so let's

208
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,479
look at a concrete example here this is

209
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,460
the L few course registration page I got

210
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,590
here I'm ready for the semester to start

211
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,388
and I see them already register for time

212
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,010
making choir practice and merriment

213
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,560
theory that's great those are those are

214
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,700
all standards around here at lvu but

215
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,320
then you get to pick an elective so

216
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,090
maybe I want to get an advanced painting

217
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,610
toy sounds I need to brush up on my

218
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,130
slate packing theory but I'd really like

219
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,300
to get into elf dentistry it's Hermey

220
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,820
got me turned on to that I think it's a

221
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,848
really burgeoning field negative

222
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,680
unemployment rate and but I can't

223
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,900
because it's it's full when the code was

224
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,060
passed from the server to my browser it

225
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,040
was my browser was told to disable this

226
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,959
button because there are Fozzie row

227
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,660
available seats of the five so I can't

228
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,650
register well that's a drag so I picked

229
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,880
something else they pick advanced

230
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,770
painting and

231
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,500
as I go forward I can see that my my

232
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,530
browser past that parameter to the

233
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,840
server in the URL up and we can see it

234
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,400
up here in the address bar where here's

235
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,100
the new page I'm on I'm on slash store

236
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,640
and this this parameter course is being

237
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,300
set to the value paint well that's

238
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,740
interesting

239
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,839
where does what does that even come from

240
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,250
and let's let's look at the source code

241
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,380
so I'm gonna right click view page

242
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,170
source or if you like keyboard shortcuts

243
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,340
like I do control U or command u and we

244
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,780
can actually see the source code of the

245
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,450
page and a lot of it at the top there is

246
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,910
just kind of formatting CSS prettiness

247
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,350
colors and fonts and stuff now but then

248
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,310
it out down here we see most of what

249
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,590
makes the page itself so so we see looks

250
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,930
this looks like our table that had the

251
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,520
headers course size and vacancies I'm

252
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,870
gonna use ctrl tab here to swap between

253
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,280
course size vacancies yup and then if we

254
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,000
look at advanced painting let's

255
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:54,689
highlight that line I can see it's a

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,180
button named course with a value paint

257
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,400
well that's what I saw in the URL right

258
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,949
I saw question mark course equals paint

259
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,470
so what if I wanted to do dentistry

260
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,710
instead looks like I would need to set

261
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,690
course equal to teeth so how about I try

262
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,520
that how about I pick any one of these

263
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,170
toy sounds and it says course equals

264
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,520
sound and I see at the bottom it was

265
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,280
processed on the server side and came

266
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:22,260
back welcome to toy sounds but what if I

267
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,790
change that to teeth BAM there we go

268
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,800
welcome to dentistry the course I wanted

269
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,630
so again it was just just messing with

270
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,560
this parameter up here in the address

271
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:33,390
bar but not there's never there's never

272
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,760
just one way to do things here's another

273
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,800
way to do the same thing in this

274
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,050
instance I could use this little element

275
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,479
chooser and then I could pick any

276
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,699
element here in the web page like this

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,840
disabled button and I can see the code

278
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,310
just like I did when I was looking at

279
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,840
source but but now it's kind of

280
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,810
interactive so I can I see the button

281
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,360
and submit course equals teeth and then

282
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,760
I see this attribute disabled well what

283
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,040
happens if I just delete the disabled

284
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,290
thing oh it looks like the button is

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,240
enabled now so I can click it and there

286
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:06,390
we go f12 begin to hide that console

287
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,649
that course equals teeth and I've got

288
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,569
welcome to dentistry

289
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,430
awesome so so a couple different ways to

290
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:13,170
get to where we wanted to get just by

291
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,699
manipulating things on the client side

292
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,439
because apparently on the server side

293
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:19,319
they weren't checking to see if the

294
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:21,059
class I chose was full so great so one

295
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:22,979
more example here and this is where

296
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,899
parameters are passed in the post body

297
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,759
so it's not as obvious as it being right

298
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,439
up in the address bar but if I pick

299
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,110
something like I need an arraigned ear

300
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:33,480
brush I want a couple pairs of extra elf

301
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,579
shoes I want to buy some snacks because

302
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,100
who doesn't love snacks this guy loves

303
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,920
snacks some sugar pills and maybe some I

304
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,529
got thirty money left so I can't do K to

305
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,610
35 wood screws how about I do thirty all

306
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,769
right no it says I've got I've got

307
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,660
enough set to go interestingly if I try

308
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:51,569
to overspend this Buy button doesn't

309
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,170
work but if I take a number that does

310
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:57,990
work I can click forward but what if I

311
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,599
want to maybe get a whole bunch of extra

312
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,800
elf shoes and maybe I want to try to

313
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,759
manipulate things here on the client

314
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,248
side sometimes it's as easy as just

315
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,459
putting in negative values right maybe I

316
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:13,620
can just put in negative mm snacks and

317
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:15,628
then and then that comes up comes up

318
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,149
with you know that's gonna cost me

319
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,170
negative ten thousand and then at the

320
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,339
end here I'm gonna start with two

321
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,679
hundred and actually have twenty one

322
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,370
thirty left over and then all this

323
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,959
information will get passed as a post

324
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,029
body parameter so it won't show up in

325
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,969
the in the address bar like like course

326
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:34,290
does but it still get passed

327
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,370
unfortunately in this case the elf u

328
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,809
servers do do some server-side

329
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,249
validation and they do see that there's

330
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:43,439
something wrong with what I've asked for

331
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:45,089
so so that's failed so that's good and

332
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,319
that's that is absolutely the way we

333
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,610
want to protect ourselves with a lot of

334
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,860
these things we want to mistrust

335
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,740
whatever the client is sending us in

336
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,929
these types of situations so with that

337
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,850
that brings me to the end of the of the

338
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:58,589
presentation are there any questions

339
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:04,290
about Web Apps and kind of how they're

340
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:05,819
used mm-hmm yeah thank you I can

341
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,110
Hezekiah yes there are hints in this

342
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:09,110
