1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:07,500
welcome one and all thank you for

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,170
attending this very special class here

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,210
at Elphie University I know all of you

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,710
are excited for the holiday season we

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,470
all have a whole lot of the process

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,020
there and present wrapping and reindeer

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,769
feeding but we wanted to take a second

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,289
to caution everyone reminder that there

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,448
are certain risks in the world there are

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,670
certain security vulnerabilities and

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,099
when you're out and about either doing

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,809
the last-minute shopping or delivering

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,449
presents from homes or out can

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,750
commercial lock in America your keys

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,040
covered up and not visible that is

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,340
something that we don't talk about

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,710
enough but we should I know that

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,690
everyone keeps little kids hands on the

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,239
candy or on the ribbons and not in your

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,000
pockets but it doesn't take someone

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,820
physically grabbing your keys for them

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,719
to be compromised it is in fact possible

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,989
to merely snap a photograph of keys even

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,869
at a distance and compromise them copy

25
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,670
them and make your own to open doors and

26
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,210
that's what we're going to talk about

27
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,330
today I am here speaking to you an elf

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,729
you because I am part of a covert entry

29
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,320
team I know it doesn't sound like it

30
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,630
would land me on a nice list but I

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,279
promise even though we look like we're

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,759
being naughty clearly we don't belong in

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,670
here

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,040
my team and I do this for a living we

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,530
evaluate physical security of structures

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,110
and part of that involves getting inside

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,909
where we're not supposed to be

38
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,820
subverting the defenses and I'm not

39
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,500
going to a kid yeah it's fun it's

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,199
absolutely fun when you have permission

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,689
to be able to go around security

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,380
functions to go around lock doors to get

43
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,079
inside of special rooms it's not a bad

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,048
gig if you can get it now there's a lot

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,490
of different ways that we can you know

46
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,630
covert or denturri it can be perform

47
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,839
there's a lot of different ways we can

48
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,270
subvert locks and security but the most

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,119
basic I want to talk about today has to

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,728
do with locks and keys many of us use

51
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,090
our keys we unlock doors we unlock

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,350
padlocks we start our cars the key

53
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,800
itself in

54
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,390
most instances as seen in this diagram

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,450
what's happening is that the key is

56
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,940
interacting with a series of pins inside

57
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,549
the lock this is an example of a pin

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,350
tumbler lock the most common lock you

59
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,040
would ever have on a door a padlock and

60
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,019
so forth and inside that lock there are

61
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,970
a series of different pins in this

62
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,370
diagram we have red pins those are

63
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,400
called key pins we have some blue pins

64
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,520
called driver pins and they all are

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,100
exactly the right size to correspond

66
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,710
with the cuts on the blade of the key

67
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,210
that this person is using here and this

68
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,830
person is not on the naughty list

69
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,050
they're the nice person they are the

70
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,210
correct user of this lock and the

71
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,610
bidding on the key that's the cuts on

72
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,070
the key the bitung is correct for this

73
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,670
lock they are an authorized user so

74
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,769
great they can get in with their key

75
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,339
however let's talk about the bidding

76
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:14,030
values of a key it's not as some people

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,660
might think a world of infinite

78
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:22,580
possibilities any given cut on a key can

79
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,290
only exist in a series of discrete zones

80
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,930
simple discrete possibilities of

81
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,140
different bidding values and every

82
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,100
manufacturer every brand of lock has a

83
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,660
limited set of bidding values and

84
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,640
locksmiths and other parties can look in

85
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,430
their big book of knowledge and you can

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,920
look these up here we have a look at a

87
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,960
quick set brand lock you can see the

88
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,059
bidding cuts are always going to be in

89
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,940
very specific positions on the key and

90
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,170
the possible depths those green lines on

91
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,240
the edge are only in very discrete areas

92
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,730
well knowing that knowing that a key can

93
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,010
only have certain cuts and they will be

94
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,679
predictable and repeatable and reliable

95
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,200
that makes them measurable that allows

96
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,900
us to grab a key and get some

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,000
information from it now as we said

98
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,700
earlier you don't want to give someone

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,548
hands-on access to your key if they're

100
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,829
not authorized imagine what you could do

101
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,560
knowing what I just told you a simple

102
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,960
set of calipers for example that might

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,240
be all you need to go ahead and check

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,799
the different values of the key

105
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,410
you're it right there you can measure

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,990
those cuts because again every brand has

107
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,520
some manufacturers chart that you can

108
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,919
look up in a resource book like a

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,919
locksmithing book this key right here

110
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,109
this sergeant brand key well we can see

111
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,020
there a series of possible depths

112
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,240
they're all known values and if we were

113
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,729
to take our calipers on this key that we

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,410
found somewhere let's take a look this

115
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,199
first position that we're measuring

116
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,930
right here we've got kind of an O three

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,050
eight five well does that does that look

118
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,330
like any of the possible values that we

119
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,099
see in this chart here I don't know

120
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:11,340
about you but to my eyes 308 point 308

121
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:13,680
that looks like a value of two so we can

122
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,310
say this first bidding position is a

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,330
depth or a bidding cut value of two how

124
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,380
about the next one

125
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,960
we've got 0.28 such as well might be off

126
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,229
by just a hair but I'd say that's really

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,930
close to the value of three keep moving

128
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:33,060
down the key to eight eight again oh

129
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,560
that looks like another three we're

130
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,120
halfway there now we've measured another

131
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,090
1.30 so well well we saw that before

132
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,870
that looks like another value of two and

133
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:48,090
on and on down the key point two four

134
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,940
eight five where does that look like on

135
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,280
our list yep that's a five depth two

136
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,080
forty eight thousandths

137
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,719
you can quickly walk down the key

138
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,240
getting the bidding out and then once

139
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:01,380
you're done this note this number that

140
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,750
we have down here that we have

141
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,229
discovered this would be referred to as

142
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,900
the bitung code of the key this is all

143
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,729
you need along with you know the brand

144
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,250
of lock that you're in it that you're

145
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,340
interested in this is all you need to

146
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,070
initiate the creation of a new key you

147
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,799
don't need this piece of brass this

148
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,440
original key to copy a key in every

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,870
instance you can originate a brand new

150
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,810
key if you have that bidding value data

151
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,060
and by the way using calipers like this

152
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,250
it's not even the fastest way to get

153
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,219
that data there are what are known as

154
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,039
key gauge cards if you're dealing with a

155
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,990
very common brand so common

156
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,199
that resources like this metal card

157
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,389
exists on the marketplace instead of

158
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,419
adjusting the jaws of a caliper blade

159
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:54,180
you can slide your key right into this

160
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,339
slot and slip it over in this

161
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,110
stair-stepped metal pattern until it

162
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,509
stops can't go any further okay well

163
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,949
that's it to the next cut you can see on

164
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,960
this key would be much deeper it would

165
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:06,360
slide a lot further over and it might

166
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,638
stop on seven or eight and you can slip

167
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,009
slip slip slip and crank those numbers

168
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,439
out very quickly so that should

169
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,870
reinforce for us why you never give an

170
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,270
unauthorized person hands-on access to

171
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,789
your keys the fear is not that they

172
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,370
might run to your house and get in the

173
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,740
fear should be well they could easily do

174
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,539
this right behind your back and before

175
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,699
you know it they've got your key values

176
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:32,490
so you say all right I'm gonna get

177
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,979
myself a nice carabiner keychain or a

178
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,889
candy cane hook that I can slip through

179
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,258
my belt loop dangle my keys right on my

180
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:42,419
hip and no one can ever slip them out of

181
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,610
my pocket or take them off my person

182
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,609
because they're literally attached to me

183
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,180
that's great that's a good first step

184
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,550
but let's think about another scenario

185
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:56,490
what about a situation where someone is

186
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,879
only briefly near you and can very

187
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,979
briefly see your keys now they can't

188
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,689
touch them let's say that carabiner is

189
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,508
clipped right onto your you know your

190
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,879
big black belt under your red suit

191
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:12,240
however if someone can take a photo of

192
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,939
your keys we can do a very similar

193
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,229
measurement based attack to extract

194
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,379
those bitting values

195
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:22,139
remember every bitung depth and every

196
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,689
position is a discrete range of

197
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,050
possibilities it is a specific set of

198
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:30,059
values and using for example a resource

199
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,240
like this something like visual

200
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:35,729
gridlines you can easily look at the key

201
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,240
and say well clearly that first cut is a

202
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,550
7 the next cut looks like a 5 and on and

203
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,159
on that will get you the bidding code

204
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,399
that will allow you to originate a new

205
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,579
key never even having laid hands on the

206
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,740
source key now of course in a perfect

207
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,459
world if you want that photo to be nice

208
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,020
and crisp

209
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,729
you don't want good lighting

210
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,800
having some graph paper in the

211
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,080
background definitely makes this process

212
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,569
nicer when you're working in your

213
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,240
photography lab trying to line the key

214
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,910
up all crisp we don't all carry graph

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,680
paper well some of us do maybe you can

216
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,899
look a stocking stuffer gift idea this

217
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,699
year keeping some little graph paper

218
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,680
cards like this that can live in your

219
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,990
wallet you can slip one of those out

220
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,180
anytime you need it just for a second

221
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,370
but again this is a this is an ideal

222
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,589
scenario where you can touch the key

223
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,779
with your own hands what if you can't

224
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,660
touch the key at all what if the photo

225
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,820
is at an oblique angle what if the key

226
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,399
is on a keyring with many other keys

227
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,100
well a couple things can make your life

228
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,910
easier the best I can offer here a terms

229
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,320
of advice is try to hope and wish put it

230
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,079
on your wish list so that even for a

231
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,730
moment the keys will be separated out so

232
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,520
it's not clustered up with other keys

233
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,890
give yourself a high contrast background

234
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,649
here the brim of this nice black hat

235
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,689
that's a bit of a better photo that will

236
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,420
make this sort of optical duplication

237
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,060
process a little easier but as we're

238
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,420
about to experiment with even a quick

239
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,489
and dirty no effort real slack quick

240
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,800
covert photo with a phone or something

241
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,230
like that you'll be able to make this

242
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,540
work and part of my gift to you this

243
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,000
holiday season is the fact that I have

244
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,099
made template lines for a number of

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,380
popular brands of lock and key and

246
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,029
they're all up online they're all for

247
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,640
the taking they're all for you with

248
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,920
holiday cheer

249
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,899
imagine this example here imagine a key

250
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,550
that you can just barely get a glance of

251
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,529
and it's behind something and it's

252
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,469
slightly off kilter and not even in very

253
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:39,630
good focus if you have any skill in

254
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,089
image manipulation software like

255
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,579
Photoshop or GIMP or something similar

256
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:48,029
it should be possible to import that

257
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,979
photo to twist it around to get it lined

258
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:53,490
up nice and true with the grid lines

259
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,620
these grid lines have black bounding

260
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,440
lines on the top and bottom of all of my

261
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,829
diagram lines those represent the

262
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,170
outermost bounds of the Keyblade

263
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,270
now I'm not talking about the outermost

264
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,760
dimension of the key head or the key

265
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,130
itself we're talking about just

266
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,680
the blade just the part that would go

267
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,280
into a lock or just the part that would

268
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,410
go into a key cutting machine if you get

269
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,170
the black lines bounding the blade all

270
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,360
of the other intermediate lines blue and

271
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:28,050
gray blue and gray blue and gray those

272
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,380
represent even and odd depth values and

273
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,300
all of my lines on my charts do have and

274
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,400
you'll see this when we work later very

275
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,160
small numbers written in there so you

276
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,890
can easily read off the depth values as

277
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,110
you try to line your key up and let's

278
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,199
look at that in this example here this

279
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,930
first bitting cut the first blue line

280
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,730
here is a zero some brands of lock do

281
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,709
have a zero value that's it that is a

282
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,200
real cut but that's clearly not the cut

283
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,630
we're using it definitely doesn't look

284
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,590
like a1 or a2 we've got to keep going

285
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:04,080
down until we hit five well that looks

286
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,400
pretty good doesn't it the key the cut

287
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,230
of the key that we can see in the

288
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,280
photograph behind these lines seems to

289
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,470
be ended right there

290
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,380
now the next value over the next

291
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,480
position much more shallow of a cut it's

292
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,970
a blue line so we know that it's even

293
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,690
and in fact we know that zero is here

294
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:24,330
one that looks like a two moving on to

295
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,920
the next position now all of these lines

296
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,510
I can tell you and if we could see the

297
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,729
entire chart you'd see it goes all the

298
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,980
way down to nine is the deepest value

299
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,200
well it's definitely not a nine but it

300
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,400
is a gray number it is an odd number so

301
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,320
what is that nine eight seven the next

302
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,540
position is that a gray or blue well it

303
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,250
looks blue to me looks just a little bit

304
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,569
shallower than that seven because that's

305
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,340
a six and then we have another seven and

306
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,940
then we have another blue out of the

307
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,880
edge here that looks like a two in

308
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,760
almost no time from a very bad source

309
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,850
image in fact we were able to get that

310
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,939
bitung code that is all we need to

311
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:08,250
originate another copy of this key never

312
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,580
having physically laid hands on the

313
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,920
actual source key the analogy we like to

314
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,100
give be smart out there you wouldn't

315
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,380
hold up your ID just to the world and

316
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,680
say hi take a picture of my personal

317
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,260
information please it's probably also

318
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,180
not a good idea to hold your keys up to

319
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,180
someone who is taking pictures with a

320
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,510
camera you want to avoid leaking that

321
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,510
kind of information now this is all fine

322
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,610
in terms of theoretical world maybe we

323
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,850
can actually try it in the real world

324
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,100
let's see if we go ahead with this

325
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,610
photograph I have a couple of keys right

326
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,220
here

327
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,589
these were just laying on a table I took

328
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,930
a quick picture we have an American

329
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:55,770
brand padlock and we have a Schlage

330
00:13:51,930 --> 00:14:00,569
brand door key let's start with the

331
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:02,459
American lock if I want to try to get

332
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,430
this a little bit straightened out

333
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:08,069
before we get going we'll do a little

334
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,680
more tweaking as we go but that's not

335
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:14,640
bad as a start okay it looks a little

336
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,279
bit lined up now in our list of lines do

337
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,250
I have an American lock I do all right

338
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,820
let's grab our decoding template for

339
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:29,640
American locks and let's import the

340
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:31,740
photograph that we have of a key well

341
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,870
how's it look so far it looks almost

342
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,779
lined up it looks like it's kind of just

343
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,089
slightly tipped down ever so ever so

344
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,730
lightly it's trying to straighten it out

345
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,010
slightly more alright the straightness

346
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,500
looks pretty good but it definitely is

347
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,420
not bounded properly these two black

348
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,459
lines are not correct

349
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,800
we need them to bound the blade of the

350
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:54,839
key an American lock here's a tip for

351
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,540
you very popular in the government very

352
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,690
popular in some corporate environments

353
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,599
this this beige hump right here this is

354
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,640
not the blade of the key you can barely

355
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,400
see in fact let's go ahead and zoom in

356
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,100
and I'll show you this right here this

357
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,260
lip that is where the key blade starts

358
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,540
if this were a blank key and you can

359
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,110
tell that if we look out at the tip this

360
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,240
is the maximum tip edge of that key this

361
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:26,209
will become clearer as we start to line

362
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:30,450
things up let's zoom out a bit here

363
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:33,109
let's try to increase our size almost

364
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,110
there

365
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:41,400
all right let's zoom in and take a look

366
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:47,040
at how that looks pretty pretty close to

367
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:49,020
me let's see yeah that looks like we're

368
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,829
bounded here we're bounded pretty well

369
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,780
here on the edge well knowing that let's

370
00:15:52,830 --> 00:16:01,260
take a look at what our number values

371
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:04,280
could be we have our grid lines we have

372
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,569
our first bidding position right here

373
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,949
what line is it lining up with it looks

374
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,050
like it's lining up with this gray line

375
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,690
one up from the bottom the deepest

376
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,740
possible cut is 1/8 this first position

377
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,480
however looks to me like it's a 7

378
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,490
excellent we can even use helpful drag

379
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,460
lines if we're looking here that looks

380
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,430
like we're lined up with a 7 this next

381
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:29,010
position well a little bit iffy hard to

382
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,260
tell but I say it's closest to this blue

383
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,569
line right here and what's that blue

384
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:37,800
line lined up with that's lined up with

385
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,570
a 4 value wonderful moving along 3rd

386
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,140
position it's another blue line another

387
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:46,260
even number what is it that's the 6 and

388
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,439
the next position it looks like that

389
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,150
gray line lines up with a 7 we're almost

390
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,220
there we literally have one position

391
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,459
left it's a little blue line it's out of

392
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,220
the tip and it happens to be a 2 I think

393
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:03,240
we've done it I think we have been able

394
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,209
to decode this entire key and as it just

395
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,819
so happens we can check our work if

396
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:12,570
you'd like to how can we check our work

397
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:15,000
well the American lock company is very

398
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:18,599
helpful to consumers and locksmiths

399
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,060
alike how helpful are they well they

400
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,219
have a system where you not only get a

401
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,589
very nice brand and stamp on one side of

402
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,140
the key but you get a direct bidding

403
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:33,929
value on the other now what do we have

404
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:36,540
here 7 4 6 7 - that looks exactly like

405
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,550
what we just decoded using these

406
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,720
gridlines

407
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,419
outstanding work the process is

408
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,000
functional but that's a little padlock

409
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,090
key might go to something important but

410
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,779
we want to act

411
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,799
we get inside of a door we want to open

412
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:56,740
up a door with this silver Schlage key

413
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,710
let's try the process they're going to

414
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,750
try to just crop down our space a little

415
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:05,799
bit so we're not working with such a

416
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,610
giant image all right we're off to a

417
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,010
good start

418
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,049
do we have Schlage in our key decoding

419
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,580
list yes of course we do what would I

420
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,168
what kind of a gift would I be giving

421
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,870
you this holiday season if the most

422
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:19,779
common commercial lock in America wasn't

423
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:23,709
part of my suite of tools for you here's

424
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:28,000
our slate key drag it on over and import

425
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:30,309
it into our grid line view now of course

426
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,470
we do have to stretch it out so that the

427
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:37,210
key blade is bounded on either edge by

428
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,740
those black lines and if you say to

429
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,600
yourself look I mean this is all fine

430
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,490
and good but I'm not a powerpoint master

431
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,709
I can't afford the adobe suite of tools

432
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,020
I've never done graphical art before

433
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,240
well no time like the present to learn

434
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,429
something new and again you don't have

435
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,309
to be as good as a photographer running

436
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:57,220
a photo studio you just have to be good

437
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:59,559
to be close enough and let's see how

438
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,539
we're looking here this looks this

439
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,928
doesn't look too bad it looks like we've

440
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:07,419
dipped down just a little bit below that

441
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:10,809
this shadowy area let me stretch it out

442
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:16,929
just a hair more so we want to be just

443
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:20,830
up there a tick more now Oh went way too

444
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:23,470
far on that one didn't I here's our edge

445
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,199
of our key this is the hardest part just

446
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,750
getting things lined up and the fact

447
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,149
that I'm not perfect I take great

448
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,340
comfort in that and I enjoy that when I

449
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:35,139
when I show lessons if I don't want to

450
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,209
people to edit things out and say oh

451
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,740
look do you deem did it great the first

452
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,850
time he's perfect out of the gate no I'm

453
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,399
not perfect I don't think no one's

454
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,969
perfect out of the gate we do it as best

455
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:48,699
we can and we go from there now this

456
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,440
looks pretty good to me I might I might

457
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,779
bump this down oh you know what we have

458
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,370
this black line I'll have to fix this

459
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,929
and you get you get to see you can

460
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,908
submit a pull request or I'll do it this

461
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,920
black line needs a slight tweak because

462
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:03,820
it's not quite the right distance

463
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,370
heart from its neighbors but maybe we

464
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:13,750
can correct that just a hair

465
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:14,889
if we try here I think we are dangling

466
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,800
down a bit

467
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,690
yeah let's bring the tip of this key

468
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,970
there we go that looks that looks a

469
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:29,800
little bit better to me all right

470
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:31,570
I like the look of that so we have our

471
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,330
numbers and even if you couldn't read

472
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,179
these numbers we know that blues our

473
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,460
evens and grays our odds

474
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:44,020
so in this key position first bidding

475
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:46,050
cut it's definitely not a 0 1 2 I like

476
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,400
to for that first one how about you

477
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:51,610
let's look at the next bidding position

478
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,900
well it's definitely not a 2 here we've

479
00:20:51,610 --> 00:21:00,879
got 3 I'd say that looks like a 4

480
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:02,440
definitely could be a 4 ah now quite the

481
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,350
Mindbender here huh

482
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,240
this looks like it's almost in between

483
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:13,300
two positions not a 4 could be a 5 could

484
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,970
be a 6 well what are we gonna say to

485
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,669
that if you were trying to originate a

486
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,800
copy of the key what I would suggest

487
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:23,650
start with the 5 and if the lock doesn't

488
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,040
work go ahead and hand file it down to a

489
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,900
6 value fortunately the tip of the key

490
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,820
that doesn't look nearly like such a

491
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:36,010
conundrum that looks to me like a 3 and

492
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,590
that looks to me like a 3 I'm betting

493
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,680
the last two values or threes so what

494
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:46,840
did we have there it looked like two

495
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:49,060
four maybe five or six three three well

496
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,699
why don't we go ahead and test that why

497
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,700
don't we check out and try to see if we

498
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,430
can originate a key that will get the

499
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:03,100
that'll get a lock open I happen to have

500
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:06,160
a lock with me right here inside this

501
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:09,370
lock well I don't happen to have a key

502
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,950
that'll work this is a blank key but we

503
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,750
thought to ourselves to 4 and then

504
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,910
either 5 or 6

505
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,160
three-three might be the key bidding

506
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:25,900
value to the locks of the key we

507
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:30,850
photographed we know that key works can

508
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:32,980
we originate a copy I happen to have a

509
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,310
tool right here that is almost like a

510
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:38,560
compact pocket version of a key cutting

511
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,860
machine this is called a pack a punch

512
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,760
and it has way down inside if you can

513
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,060
see in here

514
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,840
a tiny nipping jaw that I can actuate

515
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,429
with the large grip handle down here how

516
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,980
do I get that to my advantage how do I

517
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,690
use that in a practical way well if we

518
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,530
look on the top of this large carriage

519
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:03,610
we can clamp a blank key right into the

520
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:10,930
front face here line that up nice and

521
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:13,870
true then this silver carriage can

522
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:16,030
articulate side to side we can see there

523
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,479
are a series of detents so this will

524
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,960
lock in to any given position we can

525
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,760
work on the first position of the key we

526
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,960
can work on the second position of the

527
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,150
key and so on and so forth there's our

528
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,400
values we can work on the third position

529
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,530
you say oh no but deviant you've

530
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,510
forgotten something's - the key there's

531
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,340
no there's no more values well yeah they

532
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:43,570
come out the other side we thought of

533
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:45,370
that four five and so forth so the first

534
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,280
position of the key what did we say it

535
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,699
was a two right well let's dial our cut

536
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,800
depth to two I'm going to hold this key

537
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,720
right here and we'll probably even see a

538
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:01,320
little bit of brass fall right out the

539
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:04,090
blade there we are there's our two

540
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:10,450
second position on the key we said that

541
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:12,790
value was a four there we go another bit

542
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,650
of cutting the third position that was

543
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,290
the real question wasn't it we're going

544
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:22,060
to start with a five and if five doesn't

545
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:25,990
work well we'll try something else there

546
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,110
we are moving on the fourth position on

547
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,200
the key

548
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:34,790
said that was probably a three we've

549
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,679
dialed it into three and the fifth and

550
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,870
final position on this style of lock

551
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:43,960
it's only five pins was also a three

552
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:48,169
here's hoping okay

553
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:52,160
we have definitely made something looks

554
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:54,710
looks very key like right moment of

555
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,540
truth are we are we on the naughty list

556
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:02,179
or have we been nice how about that

557
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:06,049
right there that is a fully functional

558
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:10,429
key derived and originated from nothing

559
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:11,990
but a photograph so yeah don't hold up

560
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:14,570
your keys to strangers

561
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,640
keep those guarded keep those put away

562
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,049
because you never know if someone

563
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,840
naughty is in the neighborhood and

564
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,700
they've got a sharp eye or a small cell

565
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,590
phone that they might have gotten onto

566
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,419
the Christmas tree this year and if it's

567
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,879
got a good lens on it that's sometimes

568
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:31,280
all it takes for you to leak information

569
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,380
that you weren't expecting and to reveal

570
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,450
your keys to someone else who can come

571
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:40,070
along later and get in alright thank you

572
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,350
very much Kringle Khan and thank you

573
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,570
everyone here at elf University I hope

574
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,520
this was a valuable lesson I hope you

575
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,950
start thinking about the keys that you

576
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,570
might be exposing to the world and I

577
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,919
want you to all stay safe out there and

578
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,689
have a very happy and healthy holiday

579
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,690
season Cheers
