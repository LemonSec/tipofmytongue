1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
alright hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,210
welcome to elf University thank you for

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,220
coming up to spend some quality holiday

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,170
Christmas time here with everyone all of

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,780
us fellow hackers and Santa and the

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,639
elves I'm in fact indebted to Santa

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,320
because he was willing to host and let

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,029
me speak to all of you here as part of

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,580
Kringle con so what I would like to

10
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,850
present to you is five steps to build

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,948
and lead a team of holly-jolly hackers

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,720
this is all about team building

13
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:29,550
collaboration and ultimately growing and

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,009
sharpening not only your own skill set

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,230
but your peers your friends and family

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,149
and that's what we all are and our

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,919
hacker community we're all family and

18
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,079
while doing this to improve our overall

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,020
understanding of security and our

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,719
security posture so these steps will be

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,940
kind of high-level in nature but I do

22
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,420
hope to go more into how to actually and

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,390
actively accomplish these things so step

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,699
number zero the title of this talk is a

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,489
bit of a falsehood I actually start at

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,030
zero and go to five inclusive so it's

27
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:06,689
actually six but five steps sounds much

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,100
cooler and the title than six so this is

29
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,649
step zero because it's a little

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,360
self-evident to train a cyber security

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,820
team you'll need a space for them to

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,520
work in and grow so put together

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,350
infrastructure that both digitally and

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,380
physically encourages their development

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,720
this typically means unfiltered internet

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,390
access to a wide range of Technology

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
most notably Windows and Linux

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,009
especially Linux and you'll want to make

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,229
this space very cool and very hacker

40
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,840
friendly right so I have toys in there

41
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,850
like a Raspberry Pi Epona gotcha a

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,460
rubber ducky security books and

43
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,320
references etc create the environment

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,470
that fosters people's excitement and

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,500
interest and certainly you want this

46
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,450
space to be collaborative segregated

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,119
desks where people aren't working

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,369
together that doesn't seem to work as

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,619
well you want your peers to tag-team

50
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,750
problems you want to be in a room that's

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,790
kind of close together and friendly and

52
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,500
open and inviting with the ability for

53
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,070
yourself and your teammates to work

54
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,770
together

55
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,949
the real step number one is get your

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,299
people on a keyboard as fast as you can

57
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,940
that's the first thing you should do

58
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,750
and it should be everything that you do

59
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,490
everything should be hands-on

60
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,440
interactive when you're first starting

61
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,690
out and building your team of people

62
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,010
trying to recruit new people and get

63
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,380
some newcomers engaged

64
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,780
you'll definitely interact with some

65
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,090
individuals that have no idea how to use

66
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,250
a computer right what any of these weird

67
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,520
acronyms are what even is a mouse and a

68
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,920
keyboard that's okay you want to be open

69
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,190
to everyone and not selectively right

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,399
you're warm and welcoming so get them on

71
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,770
a command line sit beside them and show

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,780
that you want to teach them walk through

73
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,260
each step with them and get them up to

74
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,540
speed

75
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,370
you'll end up teaching a lot of concepts

76
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,910
at the start but you can make all of

77
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,960
these things really fun and engaging

78
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,030
personally I think that active

79
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,700
engagement for learning in real time and

80
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,650
then reinforcement is an awesome way to

81
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,470
teach people things and get these ideas

82
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:12,070
to stick you should work your hardest to

83
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,650
gamify everything you guys play capture

84
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,540
the flag right so make everything a

85
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,080
capture the flag give your people an

86
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:23,130
opportunity to one learn something to

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,230
practice what they learn and three

88
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,660
always be in complete control of what

89
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,480
they're learning

90
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:34,180
number two grow a central repository of

91
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,450
training material put things under your

92
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,550
Christmas tree this can take any kind of

93
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,829
form you want right it could be a github

94
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,920
repo it could be a list on a whiteboard

95
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,590
anything but remember the more dynamic

96
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,250
active and engaging that that thing is

97
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,170
the better so for example like a web

98
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,820
portal your team members can have an

99
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,260
account they can interact with

100
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,560
everything related to what your team

101
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,840
does make sure that that central hub is

102
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,550
open and accessible to everyone so each

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,880
team member can add and create their own

104
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,610
content and with that constantly look

105
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,590
out for new events that way you can pull

106
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,600
together all those resources that you

107
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,180
might gather from other activities and

108
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,298
exercises that you go to your priority

109
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,250
should be training value do everything

110
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,310
in your power to share experiences with

111
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,560
other people so usually that means

112
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,469
sending the maximum amount of people

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,020
pause

114
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:32,810
to some upcoming events you want to be

115
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,000
thirsting for new events so look on the

116
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,370
internet check the pulse for upcoming

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,710
competitions or events stay on top of

118
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,439
b-sides conferences knowing the tickets

119
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,330
go on sale which have CTF competitions

120
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,310
available and try and plan the

121
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,448
availability to go to as many of those

122
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,099
events as you can you as a leader should

123
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,689
create and develop challenges and

124
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,729
training material and make them

125
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:59,150
available to your people and encourage

126
00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:01,039
others to do the same once someone

127
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,929
breaks the glass ceiling and kind of

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,020
creates their own custom homemade

129
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,909
challenge suddenly that excitement will

130
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,049
spread like wildfire because they'll

131
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,669
want to share their challenge with

132
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,490
everyone and others will want to make

133
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,318
their own challenge that is the secret

134
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,810
to fostering group growth and

135
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,789
development now you've got this awesome

136
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,159
feedback loop of training your people

137
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:24,590
you train your people and then you're

138
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:29,479
training your people to train the other

139
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,878
people that's super cool step number

140
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,699
three let your team members share their

141
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,460
knowledge now that everyone's educated

142
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:40,940
and learned up give them the spotlight

143
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,159
let them teach offer opportunities for

144
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,409
each individual to present and showcase

145
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:48,740
tools techniques vulnerabilities

146
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:51,860
exploits anything so every Sunday

147
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,839
maybe ping the team slack channel or

148
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,629
tangent that step three-and-a-half

149
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,550
create some kind of slack or discord or

150
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,349
matter most server or any kind of

151
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,360
communication method so that you can

152
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:05,569
keep in contact with your team and then

153
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,839
maybe let those veteran members or those

154
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:10,969
individuals that have been around longer

155
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:14,270
ask them if they're willing to present

156
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,830
or demonstrate something that way those

157
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,599
that have kind of already sharpened

158
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,400
their skillset they're knowledgeable

159
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,650
they can teach and train the other

160
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,750
members that might be new to the scene

161
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,849
and that can be anything some

162
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,319
presentations can be theoretical some

163
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:29,419
can be very general and just discuss a

164
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,189
topic some could get really deep in the

165
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,159
weeds talking about like cryptography or

166
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:37,520
blind sequel injection attacks Python

167
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:39,589
programming or anything so this gives a

168
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,870
bit more life to your practice and helps

169
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,090
spread the wealth

170
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,000
right as one person grows and develops

171
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,849
they can share what they learn and let

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,830
others grow with them and just like

173
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,230
creating challenges this sort of thing

174
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,849
is contagious once people start to see

175
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,730
their friends have an opportunity to

176
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,980
present they'll want to present too

177
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:02,740
mixed in with that is the intent to keep

178
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,870
constant communication and I mean with

179
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,700
worthwhile content right you don't want

180
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,470
to just kind of be spitting off random

181
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,260
articles and email things that you find

182
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,530
but you want to digest and curate what

183
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,750
you show an offer to your team I'd start

184
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,330
out practices with kind of what we would

185
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,130
fondly refer to as the spiel to pass

186
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,740
information and that would often include

187
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,870
time stamps and information from CTF

188
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,810
time org so we can monitor online

189
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,030
competitions that were coming up I'd

190
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,830
include information from the zero daily

191
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,479
newsletter that hacker one does or

192
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,719
things that I would catch in a subreddit

193
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,840
like our slash security CTF or our slash

194
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,670
net SEC and then at the end of this if

195
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,460
you're doing some kind of announcement

196
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,320
section you want to make sure you open

197
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,969
the floor to everyone so that your

198
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,930
teammates have a chance to share things

199
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:55,210
too and do that often

200
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,540
number four provide incentive for people

201
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,880
to engage and encourage them to give

202
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,760
praise and publicly recognize those

203
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,010
people that work hard your central

204
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,200
repository for challenges could have a

205
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,060
leaderboard where people who solve more

206
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,920
of those kind of custom homemade

207
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,930
challenges they could rise up on the

208
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,600
scoreboard team members who give

209
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:19,870
presentations or write write-ups perhaps

210
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,180
they could be given more points when you

211
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,460
provide an update like that spiel or

212
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,770
your announcement segment on a daily or

213
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,859
weekly basis don't hesitate to call out

214
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,510
people by name that are doing good work

215
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,190
if someone on your team is consistently

216
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,919
willing to give a presentation or

217
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,830
showcase something you want to recognize

218
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,780
them if someone solved a crazy hard

219
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,030
challenge in a recent competition that

220
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,449
took some like unique cyber ninja work

221
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,430
give props to them if only a few people

222
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,260
like a small number work on a capture

223
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:54,219
the flag with you but not all of your

224
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,170
teammates do that's okay

225
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,769
publicly celebrate the people that do

226
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:03,029
participate so maybe others will be more

227
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:08,649
likely to join in in the future

228
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:13,120
step number five play this is the most

229
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:15,910
important step actively do it actively

230
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,129
practice play captured the flags and

231
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,709
place so many capture the flags that you

232
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:24,459
as the leader start to grow some

233
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:27,638
association with repeat games say you've

234
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:30,279
played one CTF before last year and it

235
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,769
comes up again this year now you know

236
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,420
the discretion to tell your team oh this

237
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:36,009
is gonna be really hard one I don't know

238
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,449
how many we're gonna be able to solve we

239
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:40,810
don't need to put as much time into this

240
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:42,579
or hey this is a really good creative

241
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,649
game there are a ton of awesome

242
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:48,310
challenges I want you guys to try and

243
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:50,649
solve as many as you can what a capture

244
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,680
the flag competition isn't on play

245
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:56,079
online war games over the wire smashed

246
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,729
the stack crypto pals micro corruption

247
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:59,290
exploit exercises the holiday hack

248
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,509
challenge rings your opponent rank pony

249
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,969
bouquet are the list of practice

250
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:07,509
material just goes on and on there is so

251
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,160
much out there if the war games are just

252
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,559
a little out of reach for some of the

253
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,439
newcomers that's when you build your own

254
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:17,050
homemade content your own local custom

255
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:19,240
challenges you can share them in your

256
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,878
centralized hub tell your team about

257
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,350
them and help them work through it the

258
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,860
best benefit of creating your own

259
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,680
challenges is that the author is in the

260
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,139
same room you can offer as much help as

261
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,599
you see fit and other people can ask and

262
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:40,629
help learn all right so this is the

263
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,290
Infinity step repeat this process

264
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:46,930
do this over and over again this is an

265
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,610
iterative thing I'm sure that you

266
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,329
noticed none of these steps are like a

267
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:55,269
one-time only thing this is the pulse or

268
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:57,719
the heartbeat of a cyber team or capture

269
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:02,470
the flag team your holly-jolly hackers

270
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,750
and when you play read write-ups write

271
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,980
write-ups track down the solutions and

272
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,690
answers that maybe someone else

273
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,270
published on their blog

274
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,220
an article online if you solve a

275
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,230
challenge or someone else on your team

276
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,530
does and not a ton of other people get

277
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,990
it then do a presentation share the

278
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,150
knowledge recreate that challenge or

279
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,490
like a distilled version of it in your

280
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,100
own custom and homemade challenge that

281
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:31,600
again is accessible from that team

282
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,160
central hub that's how you improve tell

283
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,130
your team and your weekly or daily

284
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,110
update when write-ups are out and

285
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,380
available and encourage them to go read

286
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,140
through and ultimately throw everything

287
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:47,130
that you do with your team stretch your

288
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,930
people this is the icing on the cake a

289
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:52,240
lot of these steps when you implement

290
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,370
them will inherently mark you as the

291
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,530
leader because you'll be the example for

292
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:00,520
the team but if you want to hit the next

293
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:02,470
level to keep a team growing you have to

294
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,140
stretch your people and drag them out of

295
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,610
their comfort zone walk around practice

296
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,040
to make sure that people are actively

297
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,470
learning trying new things they all have

298
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,240
something to work on when a competition

299
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,740
comes up that you know has a lot of

300
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,450
training value and challenges you're

301
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,280
confident your game members can solve

302
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,280
then hold them to it

303
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,610
push them dissolve say five challenges

304
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,860
or ten or fifteen keep pushing them to

305
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,860
break that glass ceiling and show them

306
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,840
the people that are succeeding so those

307
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,760
individuals know hey these are the

308
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,740
stronger of veteran players those are

309
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,480
the kind of more leet hackers and they

310
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,940
know who to latch on to and ask for help

311
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,710
if they need it one thing that we would

312
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,440
do is we'd actually just create like a

313
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,850
cheesy Google Doc a spreadsheet where

314
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,160
other team members could mark the

315
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,170
challenges that they solved that way

316
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,390
there's a visual display of who has done

317
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,770
the most work who can help on a specific

318
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,199
challenge who needs a little bit more

319
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,439
assistance and it provides a kind of

320
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,839
like personal feedback or maybe a little

321
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,000
bit of accountability so that one person

322
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,650
can see how they measure up with their

323
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,200
peers and the people they sit beside

324
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,300
every day and maybe that fosters a sense

325
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,520
of competition right oh I can get just

326
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:18,680
one more I can keep playing I can keep

327
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:21,420
pushing this okay so this

328
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,780
wasn't entirely on target right

329
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,319
there's no five-step formula for this it

330
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,600
can't be

331
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,180
condensed or compressed down there's no

332
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,710
book on how to improve people and if

333
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,630
there were it wouldn't sell anyway

334
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,760
because you guys are all too smart for

335
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,470
that

336
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,960
you can't encapsulate what needs to be

337
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,150
done to keep people engaged learning and

338
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,600
growing within cybersecurity it's it's a

339
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:48,480
hard problem to solve but I think we can

340
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,170
at least figure out that for each person

341
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,680
it requires constant practice a platform

342
00:13:52,170 --> 00:14:00,290
and a framework to progress in and some

343
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:04,260
means to feel good when they succeed

344
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:07,380
that's the most important thing keep

345
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,230
your people happy keep them learning and

346
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,010

347
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,010
