1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,298
hello everybody and Happy Holidays my

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,760
name is Lesley also known as Hawks or

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,219
pancakes and I'm speaking to you here up

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,590
here in the North Pole about a topic

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,750
that's kind of different for InfoSec

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,198
which is InfoSec social media

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,490
particularly Twitter so some of you know

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,439
who I am

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,659
I'm known otherwise as hacks for

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,430
pancakes and I've been doing this for a

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,580
while since the 1990s

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,170
it's been fun I'm currently a level 13

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,570
rogue if you haven't been following my

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,850
profile over the years it's taken a

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,680
while to level up a little bit I've been

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,020
interviewing security professionally for

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,450
a little bit over a decade and around

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,010
2010 I decided it was a really good idea

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,600
to join when Twitter even though I

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,730
thought it was a terrible idea at the

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,230
time then I did some things and now I

22
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,300
have a hundred thousand Twitter

23
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,459
followers which is bad and good and

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,489
we'll talk about why between that and

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,469
other social media and I want to give

26
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,449
you a caveat and a warning for this talk

27
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,280
it's full of lots and lots of air quotes

28
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,408
I'm going to use words like cyber and

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,689
influencer and I don't want you to take

30
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,700
them very very seriously so I'm not

31
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,919
really sure why my Twitter account is so

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,860
popular I'll give you some ideas about

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,140
why some accounts get a lot of followers

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,000
and some don't but it doesn't really

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,100
matter because it's not a very important

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,659
thing in the real world um so we're not

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,850
gonna focus on Pat let's just talk about

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,770
what I've learned you're having a lot of

39
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,100
interaction with people on social media

40
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,020
and the thing that I found out the

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,298
lesson that I've learned about having a

42
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,130
lot of follower base on social media

43
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,490
especially in the InfoSec space is that

44
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,899
it's actually a real job over a certain

45
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,970
number of followers and I'm not going to

46
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,310
give you an exact number you start

47
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,789
having many many many many many many

48
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,720
quotes air quotes influence and what

49
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,490
does that actually mean

50
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,770
well you reach a lot of people and

51
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,810
that's bad and good you can do a lot of

52
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,908
good with a lot of reach but you also

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,040
can't do things like randomly call out

54
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,110
companies and complain anymore because

55
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,479
it starts a big firestorm and people get

56
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,220
really upset and you can have a lot of

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,370
negative consequences on people's

58
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,140
careers and their days etc there's a lot

59
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,500
of OPSEC and safety concerns that come

60
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,839
with

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,820
being a big public follower base to all

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
of a sudden people are trying to talk to

63
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,109
you trying to find out where you live

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,089
and there's a lot of negative

65
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,400
interactions that become concerning in

66
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,470
the real world and the other thing that

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,300
I found out is that at a certain point

68
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,640
you can't really be yourself anymore

69
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,710
you kind of have to construct a curated

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,679
personality so you can't be too perfect

71
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,660
you can't be too flawed or depressing

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,940
you have to try to be mostly positive

73
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,520
for people in most cases and you have to

74
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,750
try to stay mostly professional you have

75
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,090
to have a certain level of

76
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,500
responsiveness and engagement and you

77
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,270
have to try to make sure all of the

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,050
things you post or factually correct and

79
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,209
relevant to current discussions but even

80
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,500
with all this work and all these people

81
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,410
that you're reaching at the end of the

82
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,730
day being a quote unquote influencer it

83
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,709
really doesn't mean much in the real

84
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,530
world I don't get a special line at

85
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,570
Starbucks or anything but there's a

86
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,400
really dark side to this too to having

87
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,680
this reach and talking to all these

88
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,140
people across the world people have

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,450
unrealistic expectations about Who I am

90
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,890
and what I can do and they get really

91
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,010
angry at me sometimes when those

92
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,760
expectations aren't met that might be

93
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,459
responding to them really really quickly

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,859
or getting them information on any given

95
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,670
InfoSec topic whether that's red teaming

96
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,320
or blue teaming and that's meant that

97
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,970
I've had to learn how to say no to

98
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,120
people which really hurts because I like

99
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,100
to help people as much as I can and I've

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,380
had to learn how to say no to requests

101
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,190
for you know assistants mentorship

102
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,109
guidance

103
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,019
just because I'm overwhelmed as an

104
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,030
individual human being and people will

105
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,680
assume relationships and familiarity

106
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,840
they're out there so as you start

107
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,630
getting more interaction with people in

108
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,310
InfoSec social media they're going to

109
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,140
start assuming that your best friends

110
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,299
even though you've only met online and

111
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,190
maybe it's been kind of a one-sided

112
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,019
conversation or you've just been

113
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,980
providing them professional guidance and

114
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,720
they think you have a personal

115
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,440
relationship so again you have to learn

116
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,940
how to signal and set boundaries

117
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,950
somebody will always troll or contest

118
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,630
any statement that you make or opinion

119
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,849
that you share once you have a certain

120
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,710
level of follower base so you can talk

121
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,840
about something totally benign about

122
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,849
security and then people will still

123
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,500
contest it or toll you and it's

124
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,480
the nature of having a lot of people

125
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,010
follow you on the internet so that means

126
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,090
that mental health and self-care are

127
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,130
really really important but what have I

128
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,159
learned from all of this you might not

129
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,710
be trying to get 50,000 or 100,000 or

130
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,330
150,000 followers on social media and

131
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,280
meet that many people in security but

132
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,109
Twitter is still a really important

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,340
resource to a lot of us in security in

134
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,160
the hakjin communities and their

135
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,200
security communities and so here's what

136
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,450
I've learned first of all don't let the

137
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,969
trolls get you down the internet is full

138
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,159
of them and there's different kinds of

139
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,420
trolls okay so the first one are the

140
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,430
group of people who are just dealing

141
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,560
with problems in their own lives and

142
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,330
they take it out poorly and they take it

143
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,460
out on you and that happens in customer

144
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,560
service unfortunately and we wish it

145
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,750
didn't but it happens on this on the

146
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,910
internet - people have a really really

147
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,410
bad day and they they deal with that by

148
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,990
shouting at somebody else and trying to

149
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,120
make somebody else miserable and some

150
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,610
other people they don't realize they're

151
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,980
being cruel or offensive they just don't

152
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,240
have that level of social knowledge and

153
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,740
they haven't been in that situation

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,720
before and they don't know your

155
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,000
perspective so they're not deliberately

156
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,310
being offensive but they might really

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,260
hurt your feelings and then there are

158
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,630
people out there who are really cool and

159
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,969
they're really sociopaths or just really

160
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,550
malicious people and none of these

161
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,870
people are your problem you can try to

162
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,510
help people who don't realize that

163
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,920
they're being hurtful but none of this

164
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,200
is your problem and you can't take that

165
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,820
on emotionally on the Internet you

166
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,289
really have to you really have to step

167
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,849
back and understand that you don't

168
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,830
understand why other people are being

169
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,350
cruel you're not on their side of their

170
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,090
computer and this happens to all of us

171
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,910
we all deal with rules we all deal with

172
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,130
people who are cruel to us and it's not

173
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,590
okay but it's something that we all face

174
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,360
and the decision whether to engage or

175
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,039
ignore bullies is really tough sometimes

176
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,080
it's appropriate to do one and sometimes

177
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,850
it's appropriate to do the other it

178
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,159
depends on them and it depends on you

179
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,810
sometimes we can't let cruelty slide

180
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,760
because we want to protect other people

181
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,500
but at other times there's there's no

182
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,440
purpose in engaging it just makes things

183
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,270
worse but what about the good things

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,710
about being on infrastucture ATAR so

185
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,690
here's the sales pitch for why you

186
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,060
should be on social media why you should

187
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,930
be on info suck YouTube and introspect

188
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,539
LinkedIn and post

189
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,460
Twitter etc etc it's an incredible

190
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:47,219
source of real-time security information

191
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,250
both hacking cybersecurity education etc

192
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,100
job postings it's it's one of the best

193
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,840
real time resources out there it's a

194
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,759
really easy way to talk to anybody

195
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,979
whether that's you know people who are

196
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,780
higher profiled mentors researchers

197
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,820
people who developed our security tools

198
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,250
you can talk to them easily and they

199
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,110
usually respond it's a great way to

200
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,199
network and find job opportunities and

201
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,150
learn about conferences in your area

202
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,710
it's a wonderful social outlet if you're

203
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,239
isolated and you can't reach other

204
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,849
people in your local area who are

205
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,169
interested in security or hacking I've

206
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,780
made lots of good friends through

207
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:24,240
Twitter real life friends I've men made

208
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,099
many business connections and found

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,400
customers through it and I've reached

210
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:32,190
lots of students and job seekers and I

211
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,080
asked people on Twitter to tell me the

212
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,210
kindest tweet that somebody insecurity

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,758
is ever sent to them and I got more than

214
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,349
I can share in one slide but what you're

215
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,580
doing on Twitter and how you interact

216
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,830
with people really makes a difference

217
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,539
you can see these are phenomenal pause

218
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,979
to talk and take a look at this and just

219
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,210
read these wonderful things that have

220
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,449
changed people's lives for the better

221
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,659
and people have done nice things here me

222
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,060
too

223
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:55,440
um when my mom was very ill I asked

224
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,270
people to send her cards and I got

225
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,909
hundreds from people in security it was

226
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,500
amazing and then when I had trouble with

227
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,690
my landlord and they were doing some bad

228
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,070
security stuff I asked for help and I

229
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,860
got a ton of assistance in doing

230
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,750
last-minute research I'm saving my third

231
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,130
wish I don't know what I'll need in the

232
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,909
future maybe I'll be stranded on a

233
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,949
desert island

234
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:16,080
but seriously most of the people like

235
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,810
that on InfoSec twitter have been really

236
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,719
decent so pay it forward and be decent

237
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,250
to others as well and here's some tips

238
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,750
for getting value from introspect

239
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,940
Twitter if you're on it first of all

240
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,370
have reasonable expectations of humans

241
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,139
they can only do so much they can only

242
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,120
respond so fast and they might be

243
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,240
overwhelmed with real life social media

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,010
is not most of our jobs karma is real if

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,260
your kind of people usually it'll come

246
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,819
back to you if you're cruel to people

247
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,799
that might come back to YouTube but it

248
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,079
might take a while let's see your

249
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,760
friends that the space can get really

250
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,969
overwhelming now especially with

251
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,319
negative noise set boundaries for the

252
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,290
time you're going to spend on social

253
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,150
media yeah

254
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,829
of view of abuse and the types of abuse

255
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,319
you're willing to take from trolls and

256
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,390
people who are angry triggers in terms

257
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,890
of content that you really can't look at

258
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,260
or you don't want to see for various

259
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,390
reasons and request for help or

260
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,120
assistance or anything you have to learn

261
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,439
to say no and set boundaries consider

262
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,270
what you share on social media before

263
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,130
you share it the internet is forever and

264
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,829
we don't want to share something that's

265
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,570
going to negatively impact us later in

266
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,000
terms of our professional or personal

267
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,130
life it's okay to take breaks from

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,110
Twitter or any social media if you're

269
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,450
getting overwhelmed or it's impacting

270
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,190
you emotionally or physically look for

271
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,510
the helpers when you see a lot of tools

272
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,670
out there look for the people who are

273
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,319
doing good in the security community who

274
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,990
are sharing tools and research and

275
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,340
guides great blogs and blogs look for

276
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,760
those folks look for the people who are

277
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,740
helping people find jobs and you can do

278
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,840
a lot of good on social media still -

279
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,040
people don't know all the things about

280
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,350
security that you think are common

281
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,120
knowledge your insight is really really

282
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,130
important if so is your experience and

283
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,190
perspective you will have to share in

284
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,750
blogs and on social media and finally

285
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,110
set goals about what you actually want

286
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,310
to get out of being on social media

287
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,380
understand that maybe you're looking for

288
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,239
security conferences or you just want to

289
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,290
keep up to date with what's going on in

290
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,430
security news phase whatever that is

291
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,150
understand that you can go outside that

292
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:18,219
scope and it can become overwhelming

293
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,110
now quickly here's the contentious part

294
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,240
if I talked what could I change if I was

295
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,940
captain of intersect Twitter and I'm not

296
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,320
um this is what I would change first of

297
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,270
all stop fighting one another over

298
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,370
things it won't matter in a month we get

299
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,430
into a lot of small arguments about

300
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,460
small things it blew up into big hurtful

301
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,329
arguments where we shout at each other

302
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,730
there's a lot of things that really

303
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,160
don't matter in the in the larger space

304
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:45,480
in the real world that we heard each

305
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,380
other over on InfoSec social media

306
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,210
understand that people out there have

307
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,800
real battles you can see online they're

308
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,390
angry for their own reasons they're

309
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
upset they're fighting for things for

310
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,400
their own reason and that's not

311
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,319
necessarily visible to us I understand

312
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,180
that not everyone is living or has lived

313
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,670
the same life as you they have different

314
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,560
concerns for different reasons they are

315
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,180
concerned about different social issues

316
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,310
or political issues

317
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,319
they're concerned about how security and

318
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,300
privacy issues impact them personally

319
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,310
because of their own experiences in

320
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,209
professional circumstances or on their

321
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,290
own and that's really important to them

322
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,090
beaker fashion alehrer spectral of

323
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,400
college with colleagues and fellow

324
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,860
researchers so understand that people

325
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,590
have professional expertise and security

326
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,170
in their own niches and it's not right

327
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,950
to explain to them how to do their jobs

328
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,760
be respectful when you critique them be

329
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,060
professionally respectful of their

330
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,550
experience and their accomplishments and

331
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,300
when you run into the toxic people

332
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,069
understand that you have to make a

333
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,560
choice whether to engage or walk away

334
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,450
and make a rational choice about that

335
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,400
and I suggest people think about it like

336
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,050
their kindergarten teacher and they're

337
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,790
in a room with kids who are disruptive

338
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,579
and unruly and they're making a decision

339
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,290
of how to deal with them so when you

340
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,630
really reach a negative point and you're

341
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,890
about to tweet something angry or you

342
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,320
know post something and really on

343
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,640
YouTube sleep on it or count to 100

344
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,560
before you say what you want to say

345
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,650
especially if you're really angry and

346
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,479
exhausted sometimes just being hungry

347
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,920
and exhausted and tired has a huge

348
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,080
influence on your mood and how you

349
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,579
approach other people and just getting a

350
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,330
good night's sleep will have a bit will

351
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,700
give you a completely different

352
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,340
perspective and remember the Internet is

353
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,350
forever so the thing that you post in

354
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,060
anger might not be how you feel the next

355
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,210
day but it may have a huge impact on

356
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,890
your persona in your career a positive

357
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,110
attitude will help you in the world it's

358
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,510
just Twitter you guys it's just social

359
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,920
media it's yeah influencing really

360
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,530
doesn't mean much because it's just a

361
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,780
social media site if you react

362
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,040
positively to negative situations it'll

363
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,230
help you and it'll help the people

364
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,939
around you try to do something positive

365
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,380
if you have a bad day if somebody cuts

366
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,130
you off in traffic you could either get

367
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,930
mad about it

368
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,550
or you can say something nice to the

369
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,770
cashier at the store that you stopped at

370
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,030
and one is going to make you feel better

371
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,640
and one it's going to make you feel a

372
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,110
lot worse and remember the Internet is

373
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,150
forever so the things that you post

374
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,490
they're gonna be archived there gonna be

375
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,500
cached you never know when the thing is

376
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,210
that you read it's going to be copied by

377
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,580
a bunch of people and stored for later

378
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,860
just give a lot of thought to the things

379
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:18,400
you post and how they impact yourself

380
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,380
and other people my verdict on Twitter I

381
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,680
wouldn't change the last decade on it

382
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,170
for

383
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,910
anything I've made a lot of great

384
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,670
friends and connections it's been

385
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,860
marvelous I've made an impact I think I

386
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,209
hope some kind of small impact in the

387
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,040
world that other peoples can measure

388
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,510
some day I'm not going to guess what

389
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,589
that was but I hope that I've done

390
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,100
something meaningful

391
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,810
I still struggle as a quote/unquote big

392
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,550
air quotes work influencer with

393
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,810
work/life balance and keeping up with

394
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,120
all the requests they get from people

395
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,339
and there have been some really really

396
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,930
really bad days where people really came

397
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,850
after me and they're really cool to me

398
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,339
or two of people that I care about and

399
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,080
that's really rough there's a price for

400
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,480
being engaged influential in social

401
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,550
media but even if you don't want to be

402
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,860
in that space even if you just want a

403
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,240
feed of information and an interaction

404
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,190
with the security community I still

405
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,839

409
