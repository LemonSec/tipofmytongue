1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
hi everyone welcome back to Crangle Khan

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,838
I'm coming to you live from LC

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,910
University and I wanted to thank

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,429
everyone for joining when malware goes

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,370
mobile a quick detection is critical and

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,350
you can see here that I am a good elf I

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,300
am happy to greet you you may come

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,949
across some bad else while you're here

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,900
at LC university hopefully not too many

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,199
for this presentation I'm going to be

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,970
the good elf and teach you quickly how

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,189
to identify mobile malware and how to

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,380
isolate it and just get it away from

14
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,668
your networks a little bit about me I'm

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,530
the senior director of digital

16
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,489
intelligence at celebrate I'm a senior

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,890
instructor at Sam's

18
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,140
and of course author and I am simply

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,620
mobile obsessed and you can see here I'm

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,719
going to sprinkle some magic into your

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,269
life hopefully when we are looking at

22
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,879
mobile malware something to consider is

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,190
the threat is real when I talk to a lot

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,260
of people who do Incident Response

25
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,269
mobile isn't really on their radar and

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,809
it needs to be so it's kind of a hidden

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,710
threat that a lot of us aren't aware of

28
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,239
something else to consider is these

29
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,460
devices are always with us

30
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,220
they are very personal to us and they

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,669
may have the easiest access to our

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,500
digital life think about this most

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,090
people unlock with biometrics most

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,490
people use the same passwords over and

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,670
over someone could easily shoulder surf

36
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,350
think about how frequently you switch

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,780
through applications and how quickly

38
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,380
you're doing this most of the time it's

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,439
mindless

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,939
you could be in whatsapp and clicking

41
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,639
through chats and then in the next

42
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,529
message or a moment you're in your email

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,750
and now you're on another third-party

44
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,360
application most people aren't even

45
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,240
aware of where their chaps are going who

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,090
they're clicking what is downloading so

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,009
you need to really focus on how quickly

48
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,880
we're communicating with these devices

49
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,740
and just understand how easy it is once

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,969
malware hops on your phone to actually

51
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,439
hop on to your work network or hop on to

52
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:01,219
potentially your work computer cloud

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,139
these devices are very very vulnerable

54
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:07,048
my device I've always been really good

55
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,330
about keeping Bluetooth turned off not

56
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,430
scanning qrc codes but here's the issue

57
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,440
I have an Apple watch so now bluetooth

58
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,930
is turned on I'm talking to you right

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
now

60
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,299
my air pods so bluetooth is turned on

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,920
all of these things are a threat we're

62
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:22,269
leaving the door open and there are way

63
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,369
too many questions that are left

64
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:27,099
unanswered so just be very very careful

65
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,390
and though the threat is real so now I

66
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,328
want to help you get some footing here

67
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,730
so in LC university we want to make you

68
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,920
as successful as possible so that you

69
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,209
can get back to enjoying your holiday so

70
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,010
the first thing I'm going to do is I

71
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,260
have an Android image and I loaded it

72
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,689
into physical analyzers and I did get a

73
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,370
full physical extraction which means bit

74
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:48,250
by bit everything from beginning to end

75
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,709
the first thing I'm going to do is cheat

76
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,780
and I am going to go straight to my

77
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,220
downloads directory now this is not

78
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,930
everything that's downloaded to the

79
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,959
device it's just things that have been

80
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,370
downloaded in a possible unusual way per

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,709
se so not from the Play Store

82
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,319
essentially so here I see under

83
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:07,150
downloads I see one for Chrome I'm gonna

84
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,268
follow that trail why would we not let's

85
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,489
do what all else do and our curiosity is

86
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,139
piqued and we're following this trail so

87
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,719
now I pulled the thread and I have some

88
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:19,060
more information here on the left I

89
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,829
could see Google Chrome and then I can

90
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,169
see something about Dropbox which is

91
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,959
interesting where the information is

92
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,459
stored and a date/time stamp those three

93
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,489
pieces are going to make you so

94
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,500
successful so I'm gonna start letting

95
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,840
this thread and the entire spindle

96
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,790
unravel so I click on the first part and

97
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,689
I can see that something named calm

98
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:45,759
battery extender apk was downloaded on

99
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:47,530
1-3 2019 at 1957 that's interesting you

100
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,849
can also export the source file if you

101
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,129
wanted to right here but we're going to

102
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:54,280
keep digging we can then see how it was

103
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:58,030
downloaded the person was referred to

104
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,340
Dropbox from Chrome so we know that

105
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,889
someone was in Chrome looking at

106
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,259
something they had a reference to

107
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,449
Dropbox that ultimately ended up

108
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:10,599
downloading that calm battery extender

109
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:12,220
which is our malware in this example not

110
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,560
only do we know that we know where it's

111
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,959
saved it's in storage emulated zero

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,209
downloads what I would do next is go to

113
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,329
that directory when you go to that

114
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,130
directory magic is going to happen

115
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,370
holiday magic right here you are going

116
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,639
to see that there is a file called

117
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,189
course page

118
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,830
HTML which is what the user actually

119
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:35,439
clicked on to get the chrome which is

120
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,448
then an embedded Dropbox link which is

121
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,580
what they clicked on to ultimately get

122
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,800
infected with that malware think about

123
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,800
how quickly we just did that so this is

124
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,639
the perfect example of how everything

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,460
can just work right now that may not

126
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,710
always be the case so when those methods

127
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,080
are dead end this is where time lines

128
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,068
are key when do you think the device

129
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,729
became infected

130
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,080
when did your incident occur or when did

131
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:05,020
the person claim that their phone

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,810
started acting weird that is now your

133
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,549
time line you want to look for chats you

134
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,349
want to look for anything where a link

135
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,479
could be shared so think about this you

136
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:16,569
share links through email chat messages

137
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,210
third-party applications standard SMS

138
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,639
that's typical look there with your

139
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,539
timeline look at any apps that are

140
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,969
running in the background

141
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,830
now application usage and keyword

142
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:29,110
searching those require more of a mobile

143
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,520
forensics skill set if you're interested

144
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,990
in learning stuff like that I've blogged

145
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,698
a ton about it I'm going to have that

146
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,379
slide to the end for you but just be

147
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,819
aware that it may require some more

148
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,439
investigating on your part to uncover it

149
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,169
when it's not as easy as just looking in

150
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,629
the Downloads directory so if you like

151
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,818
things like this and you want to go into

152
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:51,039
overdrive with me the happy elf on the

153
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,899
right hand side keep your eye on things

154
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,930
I've been working on I am a research at

155
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:58,089
it there is no hiding it I blog on my

156
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,550
personal website smarter forensics comm

157
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,710
not only do i blog there I post all my

158
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,199
presentations I give it fans events and

159
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,930
other outside events on that location

160
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,060
I also blow for celebrate so if you go

161
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,639
to celebrate calm you'll find not only

162
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,639
blogs but also ask the expert in video

163
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,099
series I report a tip Tuesday every week

164
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,120
which is little hint two minutes or less

165
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,180
on things that are help your

166
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,149
investigation and obviously my

167
