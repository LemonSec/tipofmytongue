1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
all right everybody I want to say first

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,140
and foremost special thanks to the

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,080
people at elf university for putting on

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,399
this fantastic event we were at Santa's

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,340
castle last year you all know it

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,410
happened last year cuz that happened but

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,910
this year this year it's it we're

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,890
finally gonna have a year where

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,289
Christmas happens without a hiccup I

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,449
think I can feel it deep down in my boo

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,720
have a piece of spaghetti rockin with

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,610
Santa the other instructors at Sands

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,540
Institute we think that we've had such a

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,760
long run of really harrowing Christmases

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,629
that it's finally time for a Christmas

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,510
where absolutely nothing of any interest

17
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:47,218
happens whatsoever and we'll have to see

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,739
if that actually happens this year so

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,510
here's hoping um so I got this

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,339
presentation a-hunting we must go that I

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,660
wanted to share with everybody the

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,430
holiday spirit because it stands

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,739
Institute what I like to do at Black

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,480
Hills information security is we are all

25
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,980
about trying to share we're trying to

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,289
give back to community as much as we

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,030
possibly can because that's what we want

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,130
to see in the community that we are all

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,040
a part of so let's go ahead and let's

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,600
get started I love these slides whenever

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,950
we're talking about how organizations

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,169
discovered that they were actually

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,240
breached in the first place Verizon data

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,689
breach report has been coming out for a

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,429
large long number of years and they've

36
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,839
been covering for the breaches that they

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,549
work and other organizations that are

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,020
contributing to these reports how

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,540
organizations discovered that they were

40
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,630
actually compromised and one of the big

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,549
concerns about this particular slide is

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,908
the vast majority of the Detex something

43
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,409
like 67 percent of organizations

44
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,790
discovering that they were breached they

45
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,930
find out from external third parties

46
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,049
they would find out through external

47
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,030
customers actor disclosure external

48
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,070
audit service or working in incident

49
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,530
finding another incident and this really

50
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,270
shows that what we're dealing with in

51
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,030
computer security at least as it stands

52
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,340
today is a fundamental gap in skills

53
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,649
that are actually required and in many

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,750
situations the proper toolkits to be

55
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,250
able to detect the attacks that are

56
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,038
hitting our organizations and that's why

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,449
things like Kringle kahn and the hard

58
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,549
work that ed SCOTUS and the team at

59
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,589
counter hack does is so important for

60
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,760
giving back to the community and

61
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,890
you know really giving people an

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,890
opportunity to dig in develop skills and

63
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,869
do it in a safe and fun and free manner

64
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,700
so if we're trying to discover how we're

65
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,010
breached we've got to find some new ways

66
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,709
that we can discover breaches in our

67
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,350
organization hence why threat hunting is

68
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,390
so incredibly important so whenever

69
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,280
you're looking at a hunt team and actual

70
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,799
hunt team is actively looking for

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,990
advanced attackers you probably have

72
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,220
been compromised in some fashion or

73
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,320
another it could be something as

74
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,240
complicated as a nation-state attacker

75
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,109
breaking into your organization could be

76
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:52,050
something as basic as ransomware

77
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,610
that's dormant or or crypto mining that

78
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,989
could be running in your organization it

79
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,170
could be any number of these different

80
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,190
ranges of things in organizations and

81
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,329
honestly if you're looking at a lot of

82
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,359
the attacks that have hit the news

83
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,430
lately it's very clear that if security

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,280
penetration testers and professionals

85
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,560
have the ability to bypass ids/ips and

86
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,900
antivirus then a lot of the attackers

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,550
have those skills as well so we need to

88
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,110
be able to look at analysis from a

89
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,239
number of different data sources and

90
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,950
specifically I'm gonna be talking about

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,330
network connections we're gonna be

92
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,238
looking at how we can look at network

93
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,810
level data to develop better ways of

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,209
trying to identify non-human beaconing

95
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,880
behavior so it's just one small slice of

96
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,230
the pie on how we need to improve as a

97
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,109
number of organizations but at least

98
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,399
something interesting and it's free so

99
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,900
the tool that I wanted to share with

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,820
everybody is actually a tool that's very

101
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,130
near and dear to my heart it's called

102
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,350
read up real intelligence threat

103
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,239
analytics and what it does is it

104
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,670
identifies patterns within network

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,680
traffic and specifically it's looking

106
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,290
for beaconing traffic long connections

107
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,360
weird DNS anomalies and all of it's for

108
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,530
free you can download it at this github

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,870
repository it's relatively

110
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,130
straightforward easy to install in a

111
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,110
number of different computer systems

112
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,549
different operating systems that are

113
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,860
Linux based operating systems but

114
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,590
personally I prefer to run it on an

115
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,730
abuti to 1604 system we also have some

116
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,410
instructions for getting it up and

117
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,760
running on security onion as well but

118
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,100
you're going to have to change the

119
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,599
output format of Bro once again all

120
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,239
those instructions are actually there

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,390
and easy to follow as well but it

122
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,679
ingests that bro zeke data so if you're

123
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,030
already running bro Zeke in your

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
environment great readers

125
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,900
to be able to eat that alive and kick

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,670
out all kinds of beaconing analytics for

127
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,590
you if you're not running Rosie

128
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,850
you really should the level of

129
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,770
visibility it gets in your environment

130
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,990
to second to none it's absolutely

131
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,419
amazing so check it out so let's talk

132
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,850
about how this thing actually works so

133
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,770
if we're trying to identify beaconing

134
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,030
behavior there's a number of ways that

135
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,700
we can do this we're gonna talk about

136
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,349
three different ways that we can

137
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,180
identify beaconing behavior an

138
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,280
organization the first one that we're

139
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,780
going to talk about is interval whenever

140
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,210
you're talking about an interval you're

141
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,780
talking about a heartbeat so a heartbeat

142
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,940
can be slow heartbeat can also be much

143
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,619
faster so you can have a number of

144
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,230
different heartbeats but the point is

145
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,060
it's usually fairly consistent erratic

146
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,290
heartbeats usually are good indication

147
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,240
that you're having a heart attack and

148
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,370
you need to get to a hospital

149
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,070
as quickly as possible so whenever we're

150
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,590
looking at interval the more consistent

151
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,560
that interval is the closer it is to a

152
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,210
value of what and whenever we're doing

153
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,889
that analytics if you have a beacon

154
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,500
that's absolutely consistent be it fast

155
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,960
or very very very slow the more

156
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,910
consistence it is the closer it is to an

157
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,979
overall value of one or a hundred or a

158
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,419
perfect beacon and as you can see here I

159
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,550
have a number of different scattered

160
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,280
connections and I'm just showing a cloud

161
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,780
if you notice the clouds not a hundred

162
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,429
percent like right on the money that's

163
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,539
because anytime you're looking at

164
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,270
network connections you're always gonna

165
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,159
have some level of data jitter just

166
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,299
because of network jitter latency that's

167
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,700
put into the network you're always gonna

168
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,280
have a slight variation so we can use

169
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,990
algorithms like k-means clustering to

170
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,179
actually look for the consistencies in

171
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,770
these patterns these data connections we

172
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,169
actually use a cousin to k-means

173
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,659
clustering and rita called mad mom

174
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,090
medium average distribution of the mean

175
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,890
what it does is it looks for consistency

176
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,919
in that interval data size connection

177
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,050
time and then it clusters identifies the

178
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,849
cluster of pattern c so tight yet that

179
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,530
pattern is now close to this to a value

180
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,720
of 1 and then it lets you know that that

181
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,299
interval is consistent we can also look

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,760
at data size but many back doors will

183
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,530
send command and control back to a c2

184
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,640
server and it'll say is there any

185
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,869
commands for me no are there any

186
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,300
commands for me no are there any

187
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,800
commands for me no an analogy I like to

188
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,360
use when we're talking about data size

189
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,009
and interval is children

190
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,569
if you're ever around a family that has

191
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,550
small children or if you have small

192
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,620
small children I'm sure that you had a

193
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,400
conversation with a child that goes mom

194
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,599
mom mom mom mom mom or dad dad dad dad

195
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,060
dad dad

196
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,460
that's a beacon and it's really really

197
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,979
really consistent and it's interval and

198
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,349
it's also consistent in its data size

199
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,020
and command and control back doors many

200
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:06,849
of them behave very similar they'll set

201
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,530
up a connection interval and they'll

202
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,810
beacon at that very regular interval

203
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,400
very similar data sizes and this is

204
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,620
wonderful because we don't actually have

205
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,628
to look at the payload we can just look

206
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,580
at the interval connection times and of

207
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:20,830
course that data size we can also look

208
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,840
at the connection time how long is a

209
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,789
connection established for is it

210
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,409
established for just like half a second

211
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:28,509
then it disconnects and it's very very

212
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:30,789
short connections or they're very long

213
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,520
connection times as well in fact Rita

214
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:35,889
has another module that exists called

215
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,719
long cons which basically adds up the

216
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,580
total amount of time two systems have

217
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:42,129
been communicating regardless of

218
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,779
interval and basically stitches that all

219
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,839
together so think of it like this

220
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,789
imagine you have a piece of spaghetti

221
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,639
all right and that piece of spaghetti

222
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:54,039
represents a 24 hour period and the

223
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,690
attacker wants to bypass beaconing

224
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,460
detection so one of the things they can

225
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,110
do is they can randomize those

226
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,229
connection intervals that's equivalent

227
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,940
of taking the spaghetti string and

228
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:05,949
breaking it into a bunch of pieces now

229
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,199
unless you're obsessive-compulsive and

230
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,330
you have serious OCD problems those

231
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,699
chunks of the spaghetti they're not

232
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,529
going to be the same size they're gonna

233
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,960
bigger pieces smaller pieces little itty

234
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:19,150
bitty tiny pieces but if you take all of

235
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,250
those pieces and add them together it

236
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,330
actually adds up to a full string of

237
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,159
spaghetti we can look at those

238
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,330
connection times throughout the course

239
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,188
of the day and we can make a

240
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,779
determination how long those systems are

241
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,300
communicating regardless of the interval

242
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:34,208
also talking about randomization it's

243
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,740
very common for adversaries to randomize

244
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,109
or introduce jitter

245
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,360
into their connection profiles which is

246
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,579
great for bypassing a lot of different

247
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,529
tools but Rita also has the ability to

248
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,420
look at the dispersion of the

249
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,250
connections so if you have an interval

250
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,990
that's 10 seconds plus or minus 2

251
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,660
seconds you can see all the connections

252
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,890
between 8 and 12 seconds and you're

253
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,490
gonna see 50%

254
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,230
8/10 and 50% from 10 to 12 so Rita does

255
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,329
all this and it does all this for free

256
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,790
so be sure to check it out it's very

257
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:05,739
cool tool that you can run so what are

258
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:10,349
you gonna find if you actually go about

259
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,430
doing this well to be honest many of the

260
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,470
compromises to your organization aren't

261
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,479
actually compromises behind a threat

262
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,649
assessment or a threat actor let me

263
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,180
explain the difference so if you have a

264
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,490
compromise in a hole of a ship that can

265
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,469
be a hole right you have a hole in it

266
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,420
all the sudden water's coming in that's

267
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,670
a compromise now there's no direct

268
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,890
threat actor around that compromise it's

269
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,779
just a hole in the ship in many

270
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,300
organizations they'll have compromises

271
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:41,019
in the integrity of their perimeter in

272
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,269
ways they're not really aware of for

273
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:46,200
example TeamViewer was compromised back

274
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:49,209
in 2016 and this attack allowed

275
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,660
adversaries to go through TeamViewer and

276
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:54,849
then access the organization's networks

277
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,079
through that connection profile or we

278
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,240
have Gillette Wyoming Gillette Wyoming

279
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,040
had their hospital compromised and they

280
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,279
believed it was compromised through an

281
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,019
open RDP session or nuance was

282
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,769
compromised very similar to Dragon

283
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,649
NaturallySpeaking

284
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:10,209
in fact nuance bought them and attackers

285
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,730
were going through this remote access

286
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:15,369
and gaining access to hospitals so

287
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,260
you're seeing this integrity compromised

288
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,329
and organizations that's through

289
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,579
third-party software can be TeamViewer

290
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,969
can be GoToMeeting it can be logged me

291
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,589
in it could be RDP it could be a beacon

292
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,720
that's coming out for remote access I

293
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,880
have this wonderful land turtle that I

294
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,680
have in the lower left-hand corner we

295
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,110
have seen in hospitals where they have

296
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,810
USB to Ethernet adapters that you can

297
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,209
remotely access just like a land turtle

298
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,949
from a vendor portal again that's a

299
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,199
degradation of the integrity of a

300
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:47,319
company without a threat actor behind it

301
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:49,120
but odds are give enough time threat

302
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,089
actors will actually come through those

303
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,570
back doors so tools like Rita allow you

304
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:58,209
to identify these different rogue IT

305
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,100
access points into your environment and

306
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,630
try to neutralize them before they

307
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,430
create massive breaches in your

308
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,410
organization as well so in addition to

309
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,010
detecting malware we can find these to

310
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,709
these things as well as ice

311
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,270
rina is free so let's kind of shift

312
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,630
gears a little bit we talked about

313
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,550
threat hunting and using tools like rita

314
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,410
to do network analytics i now want to

315
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,750
talk about cyber attribution and cyber

316
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,579
deception something that's very near and

317
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,230
dear to my heart before we talk about

318
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,690
this section I think it's important to

319
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,640
ask a basic question what did you think

320
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,500
IT security was gonna be like when you

321
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,939
started in this career field did you

322
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,710
think that you were gonna be defending

323
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,080
the internets and your network with a

324
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,210
Nintendo Power glove like hacker man or

325
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,370
did you think the attacker is a pop-up a

326
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,370
big green letter screen that said you've

327
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,810
been hacked or maybe maybe you thought

328
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,540
you would try to stop a hacker who's

329
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,550
trying to hack your firewall using

330
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,400
JavaScript with a younger attractive

331
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:55,189
member of the opposite sex either way a

332
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,610
lot of us have been disappointed by what

333
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,410
actually happened in computer security

334
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,270
we kind of moved away from the active

335
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,459
components we moved away from actively

336
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,260
checking IDs logs or dealing with some

337
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:10,430
alerts and we started spending a lot of

338
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,319
time basically babysitting automated

339
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,839
tools and if we tie it back to the

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,250
second slide of the presentation many of

341
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,350
those tools when you look at the Verizon

342
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,180
data breach report aren't working all

343
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,510
that well they have a successful

344
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,069
detection of less than 1% well maybe

345
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,200
there's some other things that we can do

346
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,910
maybe there's some other approaches and

347
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,430
we're looking at Rita and network threat

348
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,189
hunting that kind of is a different

349
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,660
approach right so we should start

350
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,100
looking at those things some of the

351
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,410
other things that we can look at is

352
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,510
cyber deception another way to look at

353
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,130
cyber deception is detention time plus

354
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,600
reaction time must be less than the

355
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,550
amount of time it takes for an attacker

356
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,960
to successfully break into an

357
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,760
organization that's kind of a

358
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,010
mathematical formula or another way to

359
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,040
put it as all warfare is based on

360
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:57,590
deception so why isn't when we're trying

361
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,449
to develop defensive architectures for

362
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,160
our organizations so we don't use a

363
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,750
little bit inception to kind of shake

364
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,270
things up a little bit for the attackers

365
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,820
coming against our networks so I wanted

366
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,079
to share with you some geolocation

367
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,880
software that we've been working on in

368
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,850
fact we just update this one of our

369
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,000
interns Bradley just update this updated

370
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:19,520
this at blackhat and we've got this

371
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,570
release it's awesome but it really goes

372
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,280
back quite a

373
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,080
that we've been using this tool this

374
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,520
tool is called the honey badger and if

375
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,410
you google honey badger it will take you

376
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,819
to Tim Holmes's website eventually

377
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,219
you'll find Bradley's website as well

378
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,060
and this particular tool has the ability

379
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,540
to geolocate

380
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,849
an adversary that uses or interacts with

381
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,890
an element it could be an executable say

382
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,920
if you put up an executable and you have

383
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,680
it say this is a VPN config an attacker

384
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,420
runs it Fang you can also have it run

385
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,280
vbscript so you can put it in Word

386
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,199
documents and Excel spreadsheets and

387
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,339
anytime an adversary opens those

388
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,350
different Word documents and Excel

389
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,510
spreadsheets as part of exfiltration it

390
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,340
triggers that macro and then it does

391
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,830
fold you a location on the adversary and

392
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,600
it does this using a wireless site

393
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,580
survey finding all the wireless access

394
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,740
points that are nearby and then it

395
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,180
uploads that to Google's API for

396
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,920
geolocation and Google will tell you

397
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,290
where you're at some situations with an

398
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,050
accuracy of 20 meters so we have

399
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,900
honeybadger this is somebody we found in

400
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,060
Moscow years ago Tim tones we try not to

401
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,010
talk too much about that because tends

402
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,510
to get a little bit too close to

403
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,240
politics so let's get put on through

404
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,819
that this was actually an attacker on

405
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,100
Pepperdine University put it right on

406
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,630
top of his dorm room with an accuracy of

407
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,760
a hundred and six meters so that was

408
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,490
pretty neat now the trick to getting an

409
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,790
adversary to run these is making sure

410
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,540
that you create bait that is believable

411
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,610
right

412
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:49,010
could it be an SSL VPN could it be that

413
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:50,240
VPN executable could it be a document or

414
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,770
an Excel spreadsheet or something that

415
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
you put out there that the attacker

416
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,720
wants to run they want to execute these

417
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,250
things a VNC if you actually do some

418
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,370
research and you look online there's

419
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,930
hundreds and hundreds of VNC servers

420
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,970
that are exposed to the open Internet

421
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,949
you can actually backdoor the java

422
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,990
version of the ANSI so that if an

423
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,390
attacker downloads and runs it it

424
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,830
actually will do geolocation as well so

425
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,360
there's a number of cool things that

426
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,250
we've been doing at Black Hills

427
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,110
information security that have been very

428
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,060
effective to give location on

429
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,850
adversaries and you can play with them

430
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,290
too because they're actually free so I

431
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,290
wanted to tell a little bit of a story

432
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:30,380
for fine friends here at Kringle con

433
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:34,120
years ago we had a contract that we were

434
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,400
working and this big scary bank

435
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,990
they wanted us to come out in Europe and

436
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,760
they wanted us we had a couple of

437
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,260
customers in Germany over the years and

438
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,700
some of those people are still friends

439
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,260
and they do contracting with us and

440
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,680
that's great but this one Bank they

441
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,630
wanted us to come out and they wanted us

442
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,949
to set up cyber deception across the

443
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,960
bank we spent about a week and a half

444
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,339
there setting it up and I remember the

445
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,839
CISO of this bank or at least this

446
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:58,630
branch of the bank was like there's no

447
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,940
way there's no way an adversary is going

448
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,200
to run any of these cyber attribution

449
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,360
technologies that you're going to be

450
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,820
putting in place well some other fun

451
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,740
things about this contract one was they

452
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,230
wanted us to be out over Thanksgiving in

453
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:15,400
fact we got on an airplane about I would

454
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,630
say seven years ago and exactly seven

455
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,550
years ago because it was right before

456
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,350
Thanksgiving we flew out there and the

457
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,630
only reason why we took the contract was

458
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,670
because when they set up the contract

459
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,650
they gave them a price that was a lot of

460
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,199
money because it was over Thanksgiving

461
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,339
and I didn't go away from my family and

462
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,710
they came back and they're like great

463
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,870
that's a good deal and they offered to

464
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,790
pay me in Euros which at the time was a

465
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,339
hundred and fifty percent of a US dollar

466
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,529
so my wife was initially very angry

467
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,450
about this she was not happy about us

468
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,980
getting on an airplane over Thanksgiving

469
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,330
and then she saw the contract and she

470
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,080
like walked away and I'm like where are

471
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:53,200
you going she's like so off we go to to

472
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,270
Germany on the family so we get into

473
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,130
Germany and one of the first things that

474
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,600
was kind of weird is my wife actually

475
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,830
set up the hotel for us in Germany and

476
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,510
she found this hotel that was a great

477
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,250
hotel the cost was right it was about a

478
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,780
mile from the site but I can walk that

479
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,569
it was no big deal was in the summertime

480
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,809
it was not summertime it was it was not

481
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,339
cold I guess I should say so we land we

482
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,730
get out and we're going to this hotel

483
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,480
and I'm using my phone GPS walking

484
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:25,870
around trying to find this hotel and the

485
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,600
GPS has us go down this street that all

486
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:31,629
the lights are like red and pink all the

487
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,790
way down the street and I'm like I can't

488
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,700
be in a street it's the red-light

489
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,678
district so like kind of turn around and

490
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,590
try to get my bearing and breed you the

491
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,390
GPS and it's like no that's the street

492
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,889
so turns out our hotel was in the

493
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,810
red-light district and it turns out it

494
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,970
wasn't a hotel it was an O tell because

495
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,520
the H was

496
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,200
it's out on the hotel sign and it was

497
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,610
one of those high-class establishments

498
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,370
that you had to go up and push a button

499
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,559
to buzz in because they had less gates

500
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,989
and we went up and buzz they catered to

501
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,620
Americans and like what do you want like

502
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,299
oh what a sad and they let us in and we

503
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,158
get upstairs and immediately the lady at

504
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,289
the front desk is like oh my god you

505
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,330
have children and like that's an awkward

506
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:14,250
thing to say she was all excited she

507
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,289
started making dinner for our family and

508
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,510
she yells at her husband she's like oh

509
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,460
we got to put new carpet in their hotel

510
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,450
room and her like this is just getting

511
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,850
stranger and stranger

512
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,559
sure enough the husband comes out the

513
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,719
big roll of carpet heads up the stairs

514
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,668
were like this is bizarre and she makes

515
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,640
a wonderful dinner for my family and I

516
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:35,039
and finally the rooms are done we have

517
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,880
two rooms with drawer between them and

518
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,830
we're snuggling in for the night and or

519
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,289
terrified right so we're in Germany

520
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,600
another red light district and it's

521
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:50,129
we're clearly in a hotel does not cater

522
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,090
to families normally and it's just kind

523
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,440
of one of those moments where you're

524
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:58,168
laying with your significant other and

525
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:00,570
you're like and all of a sudden the the

526
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:02,159
guy owner of the hotel like Boston just

527
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,918
kind of comes in cuz he has keys to

528
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,690
everything he comes in he comes right up

529
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,440
next to me while I'm in bed and goes

530
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:13,590
don't televisions and he runs into both

531
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,559
the rooms and unplugs the TVs and then

532
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:19,168
like leaps right away well it turns out

533
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,059
that the televisions every single

534
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:22,980
station had a different type of porn

535
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,840
that was the type of place that we were

536
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,820
staying in and for the rest of the time

537
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,309
like our kids are constantly trying to

538
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,809
like plug the TVs back in figure out you

539
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,908
know what's on and oh we want to watch

540
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:35,100
Spongebob and I'm like no you don't want

541
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:36,510
to watch that at all and like I said

542
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,969
every morning we would get up and

543
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,230
there'd be like like like these people

544
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,669
on the streets that would like look at

545
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,260
me and be like honey you looking for a

546
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:45,260
good time at my kids would be like oh

547
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:52,590
quick to the trains so it's just this

548
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,820
absolutely insane sort of engagement

549
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,189
that I was on because we're dealing with

550
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,570
this and eventually it was all cool the

551
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,280
kids got to know some of the people who

552
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,600
were walking around the streets and get

553
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,649
to the subway we could get whatever we

554
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,590
wanted but I

555
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,110
to work so we set up cyber deception and

556
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,790
cyber attribution on the edge of this

557
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,560
network and a number of different files

558
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,480
a number of different formats a number

559
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:20,399
of different ways and after two weeks we

560
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:22,710
had this we had 275 hits where attackers

561
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,290
all over the world were actively trying

562
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,910
to pull down any information any file

563
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,540
anything they could get their hands on

564
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:32,760
and we were able to locate them now

565
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,220
let's talk about this especially if

566
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,230
you're a very large bank and you're

567
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,530
attacked a lot is where do you even

568
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,900
begin right so what they did is they

569
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,510
took all of these ASNs that all of these

570
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,520
IP addresses were associated and then

571
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,960
they did a look-up on how many of their

572
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,990
systems were making connections to these

573
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,210
a SMS and they found four computers that

574
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,190
were compromised and we're calling back

575
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,800
to these various networks now that's

576
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,450
threat intelligence not threat

577
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,340
intelligence about what happened in

578
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,260
somebody else's network a week ago a

579
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,939
month ago a year ago but what's

580
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,750
happening in your organization right now

581
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,030
and this type of intelligence this type

582
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,540
of work with tools like rita tools like

583
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:18,690
honey badger tools like ADHD tools like

584
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,760
this when many of us thought defense was

585
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,010
gonna be like many of us thought

586
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,700
computer security was going to be like

587
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,780
the tools exist techniques exist we can

588
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,510
actually start doing some of these

589
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,280
things so one of the things I would also

590
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,870
like to do with krinkle Khan is I'd like

591
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,560
to spend a couple of moments and talk

592
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:42,540
about prayer because there's absolutely

593
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,429
no way that anybody at all really likes

594
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,810
this topic right because you know as

595
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,120
soon as you mention prayer you have

596
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,830
people that are non-religious that like

597
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,689
crap we're gonna have to shut down a

598
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,210
throat or you have religious people like

599
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,130
is he gonna say the right prayer and it

600
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,810
kind of kicks up the pucker factor in a

601
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,980
lot of ways and it's ands they're always

602
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,929
telling you never told jokes about

603
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,080
politics never tell jokes or anything

604
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,640
associated with religion and one of the

605
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,590
things I would like to do is I think I

606
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,360
think that there's a prayer that I think

607
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,399
everyone can get behind and this comes

608
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,740
from somebody by the name of APL Chi any

609
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,560
of this prayer god grant me the serenity

610
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,270
to accept the people that will not

611
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,129
sure they're networks the courage to

612
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,570
face them when they blame me for the

613
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,480
problems and the wisdom to go out

614
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,970
drinking afterwards and I think that's

615
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,900
something we can all get behind

616
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,210
regardless of any affiliations

617
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,800
whatsoever so with that I want to say

618
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,300
thank you very much to the counter hack

619
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,700
team say thank you very much for the

620
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,310
SANS Institute Kringle Khan is something

621
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,830
very very very special being the first

622
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:42,740
fellow making fellow with Kringle Khan

623
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,909
is actually I have that plaque around

624
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,750
here somewhere

625
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,740
oh I have it around here I've just got

626
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,900
to figure out we're resetting the

627
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,750
offices but it's something that means a

628
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,910
lot to me Ahmed SCOTUS means a lot to me

629
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,390
the counter hack team means a lot to me

630
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,520
and I know that I'm not the only one so

631
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:06,080
with that let's hope we have a peaceful

632
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,970
quiet non-catastrophic Christmas season

633
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,600
at Kringle khan and at counter hat

634
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,350
challenges

635
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,350
thank you so much
