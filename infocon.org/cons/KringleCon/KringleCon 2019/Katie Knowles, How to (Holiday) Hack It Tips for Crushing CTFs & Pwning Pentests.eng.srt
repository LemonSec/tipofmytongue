1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
hey everyone it's so great to see you

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,990
all again I am really excited to be out

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,610
here at the North Pole again looks like

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,650
we need to expand venues are you

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,239
familiar with this university it looks

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,740
like they've got some great courses too

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,780
might want to check that out if you want

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,060
to uh study abroad for some new

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,520
cybersecurity interesting curriculum

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,689
coming on here but yeah it's it's so

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,630
good to be here and I see some familiar

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,880
faces out there I see some new faces

13
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,799
really glad to kind of share all these

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,109
things holiday season as we work through

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,410
whatever challenge is in store for us

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:38,250
this year I am bringing to you this year

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,589
um how to holiday hack it some tips for

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,050
working through CTFs and pen tests so

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,300
especially if you're newer to solving

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,578
CTFs or if you get stuck a lot I know

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,030
that feeling really well hopefully this

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,160
will be good for you so last year I

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,079
don't know if everyone knows this but I

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,750
actually had a chance to chat with Santa

25
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,579
just a little bit before I left and I

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,799
was like Santa what if what if everyone

27
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:08,790
solved next year's holiday hack how cool

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,619
would that be Santa would be awesome and

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,090
he said well that's great how would we

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,030
do that what would that look like and I

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,549
said hmm we could tell them the answer's

32
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,450
no ho ho ho that's not how it works at

33
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,369
all Katie you know oh oh well what can I

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,380
tell them and I thought about it right

35
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,040
you know how could we get everyone maybe

36
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,079
not solving it just 10% 20% a little bit

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
further than you were last year a little

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,460
bit further than you expected to what

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,500
can we do and I can't teach you

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,658
everything right I thought about how I

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,460
usually handle these things so I'm a

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,320
penetration tester on my day to day job

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,960
I test systems through vulnerabilities a

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,729
hack things it's great but I'll

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,740
sometimes find myself in what I call the

46
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,899
problem spiral and I've kind of outlined

47
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,369
it here you'll do your recon right

48
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,110
you'll scan a system and see what

49
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,939
services are listening what ports are

50
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,439
open you'll try and understand what

51
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,548
those services are and you'll think oh

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,309
this is awesome

53
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,439
I found a vulnerability got it this is

54
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,030
the one you'll look for an exploit of it

55
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,740
you'll find a Metasploit module or

56
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,598
something similar maybe there's some

57
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,690
code on exploit TV and you're like I've

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,060
got this so ready you run it you test it

59
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,430
and

60
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,160
it doesn't really work it doesn't work

61
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,720
the way you expected it to right but no

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,760
there's no need to give up hope right

63
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,260
you you try figuring out a little bit

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,899
maybe it doesn't work after you thinker

65
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,670
but you go find another service give

66
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,040
that a shot you identify vulnerabilities

67
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,260
and you think this is it and the same

68
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,510
thing happens and again and again you

69
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,940
see that little side circle you get a

70
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,310
little stuck maybe after a little while

71
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,739
you get sort of a limited access you

72
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,959
know more than you did before you get a

73
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,250
little more information that's new you

74
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,019
can integrate maybe now you know a

75
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,090
little bit about the system that you can

76
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,580
use to try and figure out a web server

77
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,739
if you have a local SSH connection but

78
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,600
it's low privileges but in the end you

79
00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:00,069
kind of spin around in those new Endon

80
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,519
despair despair is not a holiday feeling

81
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,859
is it it's not fun I I like having fun I

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,319
don't know about you not big on despair

83
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,880
so how can we cut that we end up in this

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,069
situation where it's just oh there's

85
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,630
nothing that I can exploit there's

86
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:19,030
nothing I understand I don't know

87
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:21,130
anything about this it's difficult good

88
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,329
for us we've got a capture the flag

89
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,030
right here today that you can take to do

90
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,579
right now you can participate in this

91
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,070
and hack it as much as you want it's got

92
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:36,030
fantastic hints and challenges it's the

93
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:39,340
cringle con capture the flag challenge

94
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:44,200
or perhaps we don't even know what it is

95
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,510
yet but we can't know every answer right

96
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,640
we we don't necessarily coming into this

97
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,858
have a way of knowing what technologies

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,358
are gonna be in use and five years down

99
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:53,590
the road I can't tell you what a capture

100
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,810
the flag is gonna look like there's

101
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,390
gonna be different technologies I'll be

102
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,070
all these crazy things like cloud and

103
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,589
blockchain I don't know what those words

104
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,858
are right yeah they're already here but

105
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,170
what can we do to get unstuck

106
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:11,109
maybe bonused here what if we could do

107
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,119
that without Google as much we could

108
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:15,720
work towards it we could aspire towards

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,539
it even I used to have all these amazing

110
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,320
friends who were so good at playing CTF

111
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,849
and they're still fantastic and they're

112
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,320
still my friends but I don't live near

113
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,860
them anymore I can't pick their brains

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
as my

115
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,250
and I wanted to learn to be just as

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,349
fantastic as them I can't say that I am

117
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,090
but I can at least aspire to and here's

118
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:36,940
a little bit about how I think through

119
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,068
those challenges to try to be like them

120
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,960
the steps we're gonna take our

121
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,789
understanding exactly what we're hacking

122
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,409
like okay what are we dealing with here

123
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,870
we're gonna look through information

124
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:49,060
that's similar to what we are looking at

125
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,099
try to get a sense of what the system is

126
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,490
what technologies are in use and how

127
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:56,500
it's been hacked before if it has if it

128
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,780
hasn't we can still figure some things

129
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,639
out you can think it through and then

130
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,500
we're gonna go hack it and reflect on

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,870
what we've done before I forget to

132
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,110
mention I'm Katy Knowles I'm speaker

133
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,240
whoops I'm a security consultant with

134
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,830
f-secure consulting most of what I do is

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,449
penetration testing but I've been a blue

136
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,639
team or before and sometimes I help with

137
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:19,090
that too I like everything in security

138
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,610
to be totally honest so this is a math

139
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,198
book and I can hear you all drawing in

140
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,180
your breath and thinking oh no no I

141
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,159
didn't come here for a talk on math and

142
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,240
you in the back I I encourage you to

143
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:31,900
come back in just for a little while

144
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,610
just a little while it's not that bad so

145
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,219
this is a book that I read earlier this

146
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,469
year called how to solve it some of you

147
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:40,330
might have noticed if you you know some

148
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:42,789
of my friends at least I have noticed

149
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,199
that I've been a little less active on

150
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,029
social media this year and I've been

151
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,800
reading a lot that's okay there's

152
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:49,539
there's on years and off years but one

153
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,789
of the books I read along the way is how

154
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:53,860
to solve it it's a math professor who's

155
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:56,259
looked into the heuristics of problem

156
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,210
solving how people figure things out how

157
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,729
does da Vinci know how to design

158
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,409
something how does you know a really

159
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,240
brilliant student know how to solve that

160
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,610
crazy calculus problem what are they

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,080
thinking what steps are they taking it's

162
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,210
like having a math professor in your

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,340
pocket if you've ever wanted someone to

164
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,969
stand over your shoulder and go look at

165
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,799
the data and that's okay but we can

166
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,479
simplify this we can make this a little

167
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,710
more hacking relevant right you

168
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,779
shouldn't have to read that book unless

169
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,419
you really want to you oh no it's a good

170
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:26,560
book but if you don't all good so the

171
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,258
first thing we're gonna do is try to

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,150
understand the problem

173
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,620
what are we hacking right sometimes

174
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,469
they'll get into a problem I don't even

175
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,599
really understand fully what I'm hacking

176
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:39,909
especially with the CTF you just go all

177
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,580
out right you're gonna scan you're gonna

178
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,469
exploit

179
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,878
you're gonna get so excited about this

180
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,879
stuff and you might not really

181
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,250
understand when something stops what you

182
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,500
did or didn't do so this is just kind of

183
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,960
that stopping and slowing down we need

184
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,460
to understand what the system is what

185
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,729
ports are listening what operating

186
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,409
system is it are the ports we expect

187
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,169
doing the things we expect them to how

188
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:05,150
do they respond if we talk to them with

189
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:06,469
the tools we expect you do they act the

190
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,659
way we think they would how does the

191
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,669
service usually work the other thing

192
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,590
that I really loved that was a takeaway

193
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:15,530
from this book I'd already started doing

194
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,479
it a little bit but drawing it seems

195
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,409
ridiculous right this is a math book and

196
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,849
they're telling you to draw math

197
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,580
problems and that makes sense for

198
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,860
geometry but for hacking I don't know

199
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,539
and then I tried it and now I'm that

200
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,509
person who won't stop drawing things all

201
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:32,479
the time during conversations it helps

202
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:34,639
me a lot it might help you might not but

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,099
I'd give it a shot just try to draw out

204
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,830
those connections where's your computer

205
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,810
what hops are in your network between

206
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,169
you and the system you're targeting if

207
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,849
there's a system behind that one is

208
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:48,139
there maybe ports that are being blocked

209
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,270
or there are other services you don't

210
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,110
know about if your reverse shell isn't

211
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,560
coming back

212
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,690
well if you were using port for 444 like

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,819
we all love that may not come back

214
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,430
through you know some sort of firewall

215
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:04,729
but it's behind or some sort of firewall

216
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,500
rules on the host even and it helps to

217
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,150
think through those things as I was

218
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,610
drawing this out as an example I

219
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,739
actually explained things to myself in

220
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,719
this theoretical thing I drew I wrote

221
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,819
down 80 and 443 and then I realized I

222
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:19,550
hadn't told you whether they were TCP or

223
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:21,349
UDP that's important right maybe I just

224
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,569
did TCP scanning here and I forgot to do

225
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:26,990
UDP it can really help in the heat in

226
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,190
the heat of the moment so now we kind of

227
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,020
know what we're dealing with right we've

228
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,539
got a sense of the shape and the form

229
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,000
that it takes we know if it's sort of a

230
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,848
Linux flavor or a Windows flavor or

231
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,599
maybe a Cisco flavor who knows and we

232
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,279
can start devising a devious plan

233
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:47,480
because why else are we here right we

234
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,760
gotta be devious that's half the fun how

235
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,470
are we going to figure out our plan most

236
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,240
of you probably know this part right

237
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,530
this is one of my favorite parts too

238
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,260
it's called

239
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,360
googling things we look for other things

240
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,610
that are similar we're gonna look for

241
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,880
you know with a CTF comes in and it's

242
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,940
got some sort of some sort of web

243
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,230
situation going on maybe even a PHP

244
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,650
situation going on and we're gonna think

245
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,090
how's that been hacked before and we're

246
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,130
gonna look it up and see if we can do

247
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,740
those things especially for the right

248
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,510
versions of the software and that's good

249
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,480
there's nothing wrong with that that in

250
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:26,060
math terms is just looking for a problem

251
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,380
that's similar to yours so if you're

252
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,489
solving a calculus problem you're gonna

253
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,290
look for one that's similar to

254
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,480
understand how to solve a new one we're

255
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:36,819
just doing that but in CTF form now

256
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,960
you're all mathematicians I'm sorry but

257
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,090
sometimes we don't find things like that

258
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,670
right sometimes we could only find

259
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,590
things that are sort of related and we

260
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,689
need to almost reverse engineer how

261
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,910
someone found a bug or how that bug

262
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,340
works or what they did or what discovery

263
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,120
steps they took that's fine too those

264
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,070
can help you

265
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,750
all of them are information that can

266
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,140
contribute to us having that aha moment

267
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,120
where we go oh I'm gonna do it and then

268
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,100
we get it and we get root and it's

269
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,610
amazing right we get access to the

270
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,460
system that we wanted but sometimes we

271
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,839
get stuck we've tried looking through

272
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,310
all these blog posts and all these

273
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,080
write-ups we've tried looking at all the

274
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,780
ports the services and the versions

275
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,980
maybe there's a thousand ports listening

276
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,920
on this system and we don't know where

277
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,630
to start maybe there's one port

278
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,770
listening on this system and it's

279
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:31,580
patched what are we gonna - ok ok ok

280
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,460
deep breath right if we are stuck

281
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,400
there's some things we can do if it's a

282
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:42,200
CTF keep in mind there they're meant to

283
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,510
be fun ideally you know overall and a

284
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,830
lot of them have hints some of those

285
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:51,650
hints might even be in places like talks

286
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,630
at this conference wow that's crazy

287
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,660
I don't have any of those santé wouldn't

288
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,450
give me any but you never know you never

289
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,650
really know do you but we can look at

290
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,400
those hints and we can think all right

291
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,560
all right all right

292
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,750
did we interpret them right if someone

293
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,760
told us to think about what access we

294
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,240
have to a system did they mean the web

295
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,029
access

296
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,010
or the SSH if they mentioned something

297
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:15,350
about ports were they talking about

298
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,410
making sure we scanned all the ports on

299
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,930
a system all those thousands and

300
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,449
thousands and thousands of ports or is

301
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,459
it making sure we did UDP and if they're

302
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:30,350
talking about you know checking our

303
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:32,899
connection is the machine using ipv6 you

304
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,550
never know there's whole worlds of data

305
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,950
that you might have accidentally missed

306
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,959
and if a system looks like there's no

307
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:42,800
other way in it's worth looking into

308
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,839
those something else I love kind of

309
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,490
similar to a coding duck right if you

310
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,980
don't know a coding duck already they're

311
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,020
ducks that have been trained for years

312
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,029
decades even to listen carefully to our

313
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,459
problems and present a very solemn face

314
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,020
and we tell them our problems and they

315
00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:00,020
wait for us to find the answer on our

316
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,250
own yeah it sounds a little silly right

317
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,230
it's the rubber duck that you talk to

318
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,029
and in the process of explaining your

319
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,560
issue you sometimes find the answer I've

320
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,089
found this helpful all the time I'll

321
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,459
take notes on a system oh I'm about to

322
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,290
give up on trying to say where I got

323
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:14,660
stuck and where I can't find anymore

324
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,870
answers and in doing so I'll find out

325
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,520
the answer it's pretty cool just

326
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,680
generally understanding if we've missed

327
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,899
any information if there's anything else

328
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,520
did we enumerate a port that looks super

329
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,100
vulnerable at the beginning and then

330
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,589
forgot it existed to chase another

331
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,149
service these things are fine it's just

332
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:35,630
you know deep breaths come back to the

333
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,220
data that we had to start with hopefully

334
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,170
by now we've got a bit of a strategy

335
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,480
right we can kind of know what we're

336
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,339
looking at we generally understand okay

337
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,490
these things look sort of vulnerable

338
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:48,680
these things we kind of get cool good

339
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,350
got a little bit of a sense of where to

340
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,339
go we're gonna carry out our plan our

341
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,839
devious

342
00:12:52,339 --> 00:13:00,190
area scheme to get access we're gonna

343
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,899
hack it but it doesn't always work

344
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,290
that's no fun right look at all these

345
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:09,230
failed exploits that's no fun at all and

346
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,270
it happens that exploit completed but no

347
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,550
session was created it is so frustrating

348
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,560
to see and I've seen it on jobs so many

349
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,939
times and you're just sitting there

350
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,040
thinking why why did you do this to me

351
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,540
and then you realize may

352
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,219
you forgot to eat lunch and that porks

353
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,380
actually closed it happens to the best

354
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,199
of us in my case you'll notice the

355
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:33,949
example I did the system I'm testing

356
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:36,019
against definitely well I don't know I

357
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:36,560
don't know maybe that service isn't

358
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,970
listening

359
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,018
maybe it wasn't vulnerable to what we

360
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,699
saw so we can think about okay did we

361
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,050
make a silly mistake is there something

362
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,839
wrong with the exploit you can look into

363
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,639
the reliability of it just generally

364
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,259
understand is there another way to solve

365
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:54,350
this we've been chasing down a rabbit

366
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:56,089
hole of one service that we've really

367
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,790
thought was gonna be the one maybe we're

368
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:00,380
trying to exploit SSH but the

369
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,810
vulnerability and it actually isn't that

370
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,639
bad and we should be looking at a

371
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,920
different service but we haven't checked

372
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,480
into that just yet that's okay but we

373
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,240
can kind of recenter and take a look at

374
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,819
what we've forgotten other thing that

375
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,370
I've done some times do we have more

376
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:20,209
information than we did before did we

377
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,310
get any access anywhere even a tiny web

378
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,649
show even a little bit of command

379
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,290
execution what can we do with that how

380
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,850
can we learn more about the system we

381
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,760
just want to get to know it we want to

382
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,949
be friends with the system and then hack

383
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,589
it that's that's that's all it is

384
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:38,420
at this point you might need to revisit

385
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:41,029
previous steps if you hacked it

386
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,760
congratulations good work that's awesome

387
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:45,860
if you didn't that's still ok all the

388
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,660
thinking you did to get here does not go

389
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,829
to waste it builds your critical

390
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,660
thinking and that is so important now we

391
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:55,189
get to look back whether we succeeded or

392
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,170
not actually if you want to keep

393
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,110
following that loop until you hack it

394
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,639
that's great but if you really just need

395
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,480
a break that's ok too

396
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,279
I love taking notes on everything I've

397
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,829
solved I've found it's up to my game

398
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,389
immensely especially in the last year I

399
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,269
didn't used to organize my notes very

400
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:18,620
well or summarize them doing that gave

401
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:20,209
me my own internal wiki using cherry

402
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,819
trees what I use some folks use OneNote

403
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,959
some folks just use markdown there's a

404
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:26,209
ton of different ways you can do this

405
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,290
just choose one you can look back on

406
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,810
with those vulnerabilities and those

407
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,149
exploits were how you fix them all the

408
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,819
lessons you learned next time you're in

409
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,960
a CTF or on a job or looking at a bug

410
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:39,170
bounty program

411
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,120
it's fantastic because it's tricky to

412
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,699
find the right answer you get into very

413
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,170
specific vulnerabilities Google won't

414
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,970
always tell you what you want right away

415
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,430
it's looking for the most number of hits

416
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,710
on a term not necessarily what you want

417
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,540
I love having reference like this

418
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,700
sometimes I also track how long it takes

419
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,589
for me to figure things out you know you

420
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,870
might look at this and think oh that's

421
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,130
not five minutes but that's okay it's

422
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,649
alright if you take your time with the

423
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,480
system you'll notice I've got a tab here

424
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:07,459
for the holiday hack but I'm not allowed

425
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,440
to show you those answers I'm sorry

426
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,849
there are some fantastic write-ups from

427
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,100
previous years so if you want to go look

428
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,589
at the other challenges also great

429
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,270
reference for figuring things out

430
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,339
another thing I really like you can

431
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,709
watch other people solving things if SEC

432
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:23,959
has a great channel on solving a lot of

433
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:25,399
systems on hack the box it's fantastic

434
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:28,219
to take notes on and reference in the

435
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,050
future just record whatever you want see

436
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,950
if it works out if it doesn't you can

437
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,779
give it up I love it we've got a great

438
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,730
way to test this methodology right we've

439
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,589
gone through our four steps we've hacked

440
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,270
the things where we've gotten to a point

441
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:44,390
where we want a document how far we got

442
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:47,510
maybe save it for later and now we need

443
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,800
to practice so if you want to go out and

444
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,220
get involved in the holiday hack

445
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,290
challenge I definitely recommend you do

446
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,130
even if you didn't get super involved

447
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:00,170
last year just try try to do one two

448
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,839
more challenges I'm gonna push myself to

449
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,339
as well I have yet to finish it because

450
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,439
I always get so busy putting together

451
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,569
talks and having about the holidays and

452
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,439
those are great but maybe I can finish

453
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,760
it this year

454
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,620
will you so in summary I don't need you

455
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,910
to read all of these now but I did want

456
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,819
to give this to you so you can reference

457
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:22,040
it as you work on the challenge make

458
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,500
sure that when you get stuck you don't

459
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,059
necessarily get frustrated at first you

460
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,160
can take a break sure but when you come

461
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,780
back maybe these steps will help you

462
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,360
think through it feel free to screenshot

463
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,730
this hang on to it whatever you need to

464
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,629
reference whenever you get to that point

465
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:41,690
of oh my gosh I can't possibly hack this

466
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,470
cuz you probably can so that's all I've

467
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,050
got for you

468
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,220
huge Happy Holidays to all of you thank

469
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,950
you for coming out to the North Pole

470
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,760
it's a long trip I uh I get to play a

471
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,490
lot of video game

472
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,379
so anytime I dig a flight over here when

473
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,030
you're stuck just give it a shot

474
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,230
reframe your perspective and see if you

475
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,300
can get a little further than you

476
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,620
expected to on your own I think you'll

477
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,260
figure something out that you didn't

478
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,020
expect to you can take problems one step

479
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,820
at a time even if you started on a crazy

480
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,590
hectic tilt I love doing that kind of

481
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,260
thing right it's minute zero and bam

482
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,790
we're off but it's okay to slow down and

483
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,740
think things out too that kind of

484
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,629
thinking never goes to waste in the long

485
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,090
run is your training you're thinking

486
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,250
muscles it's pretty cool and remember to

487
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:25,280
take cocoa breaks obviously it's the
