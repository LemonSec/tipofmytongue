1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,660
what's up Kringle khan I am so excited

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,090
to be here in the very chilly North Pole

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,190
of course I wouldn't be here if it

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,379
wasn't for the man in the big red suit

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,750
that's right I'm talking about Santa

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,690
Claus himself asking me to come out

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,910
present I am so thankful and honored I

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,220
wanted to give a shout out to all of the

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,230
organizers who put in so much time and

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,229
effort into making this conference

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,929
happen and last but certainly not least

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,570
I wanted to extend a thank you to the

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,190
Association of Christmas villains for

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,640
giving me the time off of my busy

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,099
schedule to come out and present today

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,950
this is Santa's naughty list holiday

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,719
themed social engineering attacks I'm

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,719
snow let's rock and roll a little bit

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,660
about myself I am a professional social

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,430
engineer and I focus on open source

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,879
intelligence or ascent

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,730
I'll now refer to does fishing fishing

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,720
which is voice phishing and my favorite

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,670
physical security before I give my

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,679
presentation I always like to explain

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,600
why I came up with the talk that I'm

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,509
about to give that way you know where my

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:23,009
mind sets at so q4 is a crazy time of

29
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,990
year for consultants organizations have

30
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,420
budget left they have to spend before

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,399
January 1st or there may have an

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,369
assessment left for compliance reason

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,549
whatever it is it always hits in q4 in

34
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,740
it's ridiculous and hectic it's also

35
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,659
stressful time of year for users they

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,789
may have deadlines their train hit and

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,939
just a normal stress of the holiday

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,700
season with those two things above I

39
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,679
wanted to offer out some suggestions for

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,439
different types of social engineering

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,149
attacks that we can use around this time

42
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:59,699
of year the agenda for today's very fast

43
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,189
talk is looking at some phishing

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,649
campaign examples that are typically

45
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,809
successful this time of year we're also

46
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,640
gonna be talking about physical security

47
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,569
and one example for Breaking and

48
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,160
Entering we'll also be discussing

49
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,290
defense suggestions for both of these

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,470
two social engineering attack vectors

51
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,260
and what organizations can do to stop

52
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,530
these attacks all right jumping right

53
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,720
into fishing so I have created a fish

54
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,150
and I will show that example in just a

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,030
second but the goal of that fish is to

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,640
get Santa Claus to click on a malicious

57
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,530
URL and the pretext that we will be

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,980
using is that we are going to be

59
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,230
impersonating HR and we will be stating

60
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,280
that there's a new pto policy that all

61
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,890
employees must review in sign here is

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,220
the example fishing email the subject is

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,339
north pole inc pto policy update from

64
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,500
Human Resources Kris Kringle we are

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,810
pleased to announce that North Pole Inc

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,630

67
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,280
PTO policy for all full-time employees

68
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,150
that will go into effect starting

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,820
January 1st 2020 employee must review

70
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,340
and assign the policy located here which

71
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,030
is a hyperlink no later than December

72
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,120
20th 2019 failure to do so may result in

73
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,700
loss of accrued hours please ensure you

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,130
review the policy in its entirety as it

75
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,310
may affect any remaining PTO hours

76
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,100
employees have left in 2019 if you have

77
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,079
any questions or concerns feel free to

78
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,340
reply to this email and we will get back

79
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,340
to you as soon as possible

80
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,940
warm regards Human Resources Department

81
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,799
North Pole Inc and their phone number

82
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,350
now in the following slides I'm going to

83
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,690
be breaking down this email and talking

84
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,920
about different techniques used that

85
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,060
would make this campaign successful

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,540
something that I find extremely

87
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,989
important is looking outside of InfoSec

88
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,900
to other industries to learn different

89
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,900
techniques and tactics and the two

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,510
industries that I learn a lot from our

91
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,329
marketing and sells there's tons and

92
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,629
tons of information that I find and I

93
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,760
use especially in phishing campaigns so

94
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,159
if you're doing a lot of fishing that's

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,110
something I would recommend

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,430
only doing is researching both of those

97
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:29,250
industries OSINT is crucial when it

98
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,310
comes to picking the perfect pretext for

99
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,160
phishing campaigns a website that I like

100
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,700
to use a lot is glass door there I'm

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,220
able to identify vendors once I can see

102
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,260
who their vendors are I can use that

103
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,750
information to either impersonate them

104
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:49,200
or reference them in my phishing emails

105
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm also able to read through reviews

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,120
and see what employees are talking about

107
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,400
do they love different types of benefits

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,800
or policies that they have in place or

109
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,169
maybe they don't like them any little

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,950
piece of information we can use to our

111
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,110
advantage one of the first things your

112
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,630
target is going to see outside of the

113
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,630
sender is a subject line you want to

114
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,240
make sure it's short and sweet and that

115
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,770
it's not too long that the email clients

116
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,620
cutting it off because then they won't

117
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,120
even be able to read it and it has to

118
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,430
have a sense of importance or else

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,540
they're just going to skip over it so

120
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:31,050
here we have a very simple short and

121
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,260
important subject line typosquatting is

122
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,260
a tactic I've been using a lot lately

123
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,210
how it works is you use the domain that

124
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,880
looks very similar to the one that

125
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,640
you're impersonating so some examples

126
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,290
would be if the domain has a W in it

127
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,719
then you would purchase a domain with

128
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,720
two V's next to each other or you would

129
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,240
swap two character placements things

130
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,150
like this are pretty easy to overlook in

131
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,820
the example for the phishing campaign I

132
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,030
created for the ink instead of a capital

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,840
I it's just a yellow and it's really

134
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:09,630
hard to see so you can buy typosquatting

135
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,179
domains for internal like we have in the

136
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,340
example here or external so if you're

137
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,950
impersonating a vendor or just someone

138
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,679
outside of the organization a tool that

139
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,520
I like to use is URL crazy and you can

140
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,640
check it out here people love hearing

141
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,640
the sound of their own name and using a

142
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,750
full name in a phishing campaign can go

143
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,719
along

144
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,450
way MailChimp did a study and when they

145
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,520
used the first and last name compared to

146
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,640
just the last or just the first name

147
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,280
their emails got so many more opens and

148
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,349
I think that's extremely important so my

149
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,780
suggestion is spend the extra time

150
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:52,170
during Osen so don't go out and grab

151
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,820
just email addresses make sure you're

152
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,620
finding the full names too in

153
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,280
incorporating those in your phishing

154
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,770
campaigns a social engineering tactic

155
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,619
that was used in this phishing email was

156
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:08,359
Authority we did this by impersonating

157
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,740
human resources we can use authority by

158
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,230
impersonating specific people or groups

159
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,510
of people something important with

160
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,330
Authority and especially fishing is

161
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:22,950
having credibility and we can gain that

162
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:25,890
instantly by using an exact copy of an

163
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,530
email signature now in this example this

164
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,450
is exactly what the North Pole inks

165
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,000
Human Resources Department signature

166
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,039
looks like I know this because I sent

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,800
them an email ahead of time before I

168
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,110
even crafted the campaign and got a

169
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,450
response from them in that response was

170
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,150
that email signature that I was able to

171
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:48,659
use in the phishing campaign so now that

172
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,030
I have credibility I look so much more

173
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,660
legitimate and I have trust built with

174
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,460
the target another social engineering

175
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,430
technique that we used in the phishing

176
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,580
email is urgency we did this by saying

177
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,190
you had to complete this no later than

178
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:09,599
December 20th right it's giving them

179
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:12,030
that time line and using urgency is a

180
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,520
balancing act it can really make or

181
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:18,270
break a campaign so you have to do it

182
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,820
just right you don't want to say this is

183
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:24,390
due in 24 hours or due immediately

184
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,760
that's gonna set up red flags like crazy

185
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,620
and your fish is gonna get reported

186
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,010
faster than you can name all the

187
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,140
reindeers on the flip side you also

188
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,650
don't want to set the date way too far

189
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,390
into the future 3 4 5 weeks because then

190
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,588
your targets gonna put it off and think

191
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,260
I could do this later

192
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,790
I don't have

193
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,220
do it right now and they're gonna forget

194
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,900
about it and not comply so you have to

195
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,230
find that sweet spot when you're using

196
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,939
urgency there is a marketing technique

197
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,550
used in the fishing email and that's

198
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,470
called a call to action and what that is

199
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,290
is that's a statement where we're asking

200
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,350
our target to do something it's

201
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,300
something that I see often overlooked in

202
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,490
fishing campaigns and it's very

203
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,859
important so if you are making a lot of

204
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,480
fishing campaigns I highly suggest going

205
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,640
out and researching different types of

206
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,570
call to actions to make your campaigns

207
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,750
so much more successful in this fishing

208
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,900
email I used the phrase feel free to

209
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,870
reply to this email I did this very

210
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,420
specifically I want to have control over

211
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,020
this campaign I don't want someone who's

212
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:35,229
confused or might have questions go and

213
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,110
email someone directly in HR I want them

214
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,080
to reply so I get it and I can control

215
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,850
that conversation as much as possible

216
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,190
one of the defense suggestions I have is

217
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,800
to use an external sender warning this

218
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,920
can be placed in the subject line body

219
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,170
of the email or even both it's really a

220
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,569
visual flag for employees that let them

221
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,729
know the email they received came from

222
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,550
outside the organization so be cautious

223
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,610
with opening attachments or clicking on

224
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,949
any links it's important to test

225
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,950
employees on this so whether you just

226
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,350
set this control up or you've had it in

227
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,500
place make sure you're sending them

228
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,790
emails impersonating internal and seeing

229
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,880
if they're still clicking on links or

230
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,500
opening attachments if so they probably

231
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,600
don't really understand what that

232
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,330
warning is and they might need to be

233
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,570
retrained on the importance of it my

234
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:31,090
next defensive suggestion is around type

235
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,670
of squatting use a tool like URL crazy

236
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:36,280
and your organization's domain to see

237
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,770
what domains are available that are type

238
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,589
o squatting I would either buy those or

239
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,079
block them also see which ones are

240
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,510
already purchased and perform some I are

241
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,250
against them maybe you've been receiving

242
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,050
a tax or there's some malicious ones

243
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,250
that have just been purchased you're

244
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,160
gonna want to check those out and

245
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,990
probably block those

246
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,890
my last set of suggestions around

247
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,510
defense is security or EMS training you

248
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,029
really want to make sure it's not

249
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,399
outdated if you go back and look at the

250
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,100
example of the phishing email that we

251
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,190
use there's not a lot of typos or long

252
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,040
sketchy looking URLs you want to make

253
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,529
sure your training really has realistic

254
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,769
current-day issues so things like

255
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,990
typosquatting you also want to make sure

256
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,140
that you're testing your employees often

257
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,579
and I like to suggest letting them know

258
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,560
that you're going to be testing them

259
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,790
this keeps them on their toes and

260
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,810
they're always looking out for these

261
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,660
type of attacks

262
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,699
now let's discuss some fishing campaigns

263
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,640
that are typically successful this time

264
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,740
of year you have policies that are going

265
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,800
to be going into place the next year

266
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,140
this doesn't limit you to PTO you can

267
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,359
use any other type of policy I would

268
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,660
suggest searching the last door and see

269
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,930
what employees are talking about open

270
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,000
enrollment is also highly successful

271
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:01,000
because employees receive this type of

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,149
email around this time of year and they

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,220
are expecting it you also have fun

274
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,060
things like holiday office parties I

275
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,490
would create an email something like

276
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,018
event information is attached and then

277
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,850
that way the employee would have to go

278
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:18,670
and open the attachment to get more

279
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,380
details or something along the lines of

280
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,360
check out what you've been assigned to

281
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,370
bring to the potluck of course

282
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,269
everyone's gonna want to know what that

283
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:30,420
is another type of successful phishing

284
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:33,279
campaign that I've used in the past is

285
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,010
impersonating the CEO with some type of

286
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,980
announcement for the next year maybe

287
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,649
tease some type of a merger or a company

288
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,779
buyout that's the kind of stuff that

289
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:48,250
employees are going to want to see right

290
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:51,010
away moving on to physical security

291
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,140
there's a lot of ways we can break into

292
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,709
organizations around this time of year

293
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,779
of course with authorization so you get

294
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,640
sneak into holiday events and I'll be

295
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:04,510
covering some different things to think

296
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,279
about in the next set of slides then

297
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,980
there's something I like to call the

298
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,480
reverse tailgate

299
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,670
traditional tailgating is defined as

300
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,980
following someone into a secure area

301
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,740
without authorization however the

302
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,390
reverse tailgate is waiting for someone

303
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,940
to leave the secure area

304
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,540
and as that doors shutting that's when

305
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,150
you make your opportunity to get inside

306
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,949
this technique works amazing this time

307
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,720
of year because a lot of people are

308
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,880
checked out their stress they just want

309
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,110
to get home so I like to do this at the

310
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,620
end of the day as people are leaving

311
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:41,080
there are a lot less likely to report me

312
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,330
join me on a holiday heist we are going

313
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,910
to be breaking into an organization

314
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,920
during their Christmas party the first

315
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,670
thing we need to know when's it gonna

316
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,729
happen we can check the targets website

317
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,380
again this happens more with small and

318
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,750
medium-sized businesses they tend to

319
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,700
have event calendars we could also look

320
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,910
through social media posts of both the

321
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,920
organization and employees and you want

322
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,719
to look through current posts and past

323
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,449
posts around November and December of

324
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,810
previous years if you still can't find

325
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,690
it

326
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,119
call and ask you can impersonate a local

327
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,010
catering company and just say hey I want

328
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,720
it to confirm the time we didn't have it

329
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,450
written down and hopefully they'll give

330
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,310
you the time and date now we have to

331
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,220
figure out who we're gonna be pretending

332
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,000
to be are we gonna be event staff an

333
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,090
employee or a family member of an

334
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,220
employee once we have that picked out we

335
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,800
need to have some pretext support items

336
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,220
so are there any type of uniforms in

337
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,290
place and then trappings and what I mean

338
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,360
by trappings is if we're pretending to

339
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,520
be an employee do they have a badge and

340
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,980
what does that look like but not just a

341
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,870
badge alone is there a lanyard do they

342
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,150
use clips do they always clip it in a

343
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,510
specific location the more information

344
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,670
we can find during ascent so we can look

345
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,280
at the part the more we'll be able to

346
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,400
pull this off and then we have some

347
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,130
don'ts for protect support items you

348
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,620
don't want to wear bright colors or have

349
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,260
any type of strong smell like a perfume

350
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,450
or a Cologne that's gonna draw attention

351
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,880
to you and put a target on you you want

352
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,190
to blend in

353
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:26,250
as much as possible without standing out

354
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:28,079
and whoops Ron don't list some social

355
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,449
engineering techniques to keep in mind

356
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,310
as we're breaking into the building we

357
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:35,279
can impersonate someone like the head

358
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,550
event planner or a family member of a

359
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,870
c-level again this requires a lot of

360
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,469
Osen because you want to make sure

361
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,420
you're impersonating the right person

362
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,490
you can also use sympathy if you're

363
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,500
stopped or question you can act loss

364
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,449
you're going to want to do this if

365
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,699
you're pretending to be someone outside

366
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:54,449
of an employee because they should know

367
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:57,389
where they're going

368
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:59,459
these are just some tips in general to

369
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:03,240
break into organizations around

370
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:05,069
Christmas time during their party now a

371
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,459
couple defense suggestions around

372
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:11,219
physical security consider implementing

373
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:14,518
some type of policy that requires any

374
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:18,959
visitor or vendor on site to be escorted

375
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:21,810
at all times another suggestion I have

376
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,638
for defense is making sure your physical

377
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,099
security assessments you have performed

378
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,069
doesn't only test your building and

379
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,930
physical controls but it also tests your

380
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:33,509
employee security awareness you want to

381
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,819
make sure they're stopping and reporting

382
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:38,130
suspicious visitors this can be done

383
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:41,089
through a handful of attack vectors like

384
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,930
piggybacking eliciting information or

385
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,069
just seeing if employees will stop and

386
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:51,508
report you if you're doing something

387
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:56,839
suspicious out in the open and that is a

388
00:16:51,509 --> 00:17:00,420
wrap but before I go a shout out to the

389
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:03,300
Association of Christmas villains this

390
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:07,530
