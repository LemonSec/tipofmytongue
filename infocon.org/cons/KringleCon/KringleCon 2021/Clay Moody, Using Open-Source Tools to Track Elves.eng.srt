00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,360
ho ho ho cent using open source tools to

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,360
track elves i'm clay moody and it's

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
great to be back with you all here at

you know on the way up to the castle

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,840
today on the gondola i saw that it was

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
negative 40 degrees outside it didn't

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
say which scale it was but i'm not

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,799
really sure it even matters

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,519
a little bit about me before we get

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,360

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,640
at west point at the united states

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
competition sort of like holiday hack

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
challenge i was assigned as a researcher

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
with the army cyber institute where i

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
studied advanced education

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
for technically talented service members

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,840
and i was the lead of the tatooine

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,199
was quite an honor to serve and i'm glad

27

i've got a long running history with

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
holiday hack challenge in kringlecon

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
i've been a challenge developer

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,560
what helped design websites in the past

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
i've played tested some of the

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
challenges and last year i served as an

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,000
uh concierge

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,439
but this is the first time i've had a

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,799
chance to be a speaker and i'm really

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,280
glad to be with you here you know some

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
interesting things about me is i really

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
love punch cards i love puns python and

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
even play testing apparently also like

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
words that start with p

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,720
so let's get started with some

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759
definitions what is ocent well ocean is

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
short for open source intelligence and

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
it's defined in the title 50 of the

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
united states code

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
as you can see on the slide there is

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
intelligence is produced from publicly

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,960
available information okay so publicly

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,320
available that's what the open part

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,200
means

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
okay there's other types of intelligence

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
also that we talk about inside the

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
intelligence community but not

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,040
necessarily in the the ctf world or in

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,479
the cyber security world but we have

57
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,560
human intelligence or hument we've got

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
signal intelligence or sigit and then

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
there's always the famous rument or

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
rumor intelligence that's not a real one

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
but it's a fun thing to talk about

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
so to get started you know if you

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
haven't ever used osen tools before

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
there's a great website called the osen

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,959
framework it's run by a gentleman here

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,959
shown with the twitter handle

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
name is justin nordine

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
and it's open source for you all but

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,080
it's got a great

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
web interface that allows you to pick a

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,080
pick a topic in which you're interested

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
and then navigate and expand the tree

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
all the way down to the various tools

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
and as we go through and talk about some

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
of these tools today i'll try to

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
reference back where they fall in the

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,879
ocean framework for you to get started

78
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,879
so we think we're very appreciative of

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,920
justin

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
and and all the open source community

81
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,680
for providing tools

82
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
for us to use like this one

83
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
but instead of just talking about tools

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
and how you can use them let's actually

85
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
do a couple practical exercises

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
so

87
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
we've got these elves up here the north

88
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,599
pole and they were showing me earlier uh

89
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,360
this week that

90
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
during the off season they were able to

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
go out and follow their favorite rock

92
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,599
band let it snow well let it snow had a

93
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,519
world tour coming out of the

94
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
shut down world tour of 2020 and our

95
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
elves were able to travel to many

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
locations where the band was playing and

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
what they did while they were on this

98
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
tour is they took various photos and

99
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
they sent them to us on our santagram

100
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,360
app

101
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,959
and with each picture they sent us they

102
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,120
sent us a they provided a question a

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
basic question about each picture that

104
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
they'd like us to try to solve so i

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
guess they really want to see how well

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,280
we are at ocean and how we can use our

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
skills

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,080
and so what we're going to do is we're

109
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,319
going to work through these three images

110
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
that they provided to us so picture one

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,879
we've got an elf in front of a

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,720
interesting looking landmark

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
uh picture two

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,319
we have um

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,560
some snow can't really tell what that is

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
and then picture three well there looks

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,319
like a bus and a street sign and so we

118
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,080
can see below there the questions that

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
come along with these pictures

120
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,599
so picture one is saying what city was

121
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
this picture taken in that's probably we

122
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
can figure that out the next is what is

123
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,760
the name of the resort this picture was

124
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,959
taken

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,200
hmm that might be fun and then the last

126
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
is what's the name of the business that

127
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,959
i am facing this one looks like it

128
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,440
should be a challenge so let's go on

129
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,199
let's focus back on this first picture

130
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,120
that was provided to us so as we can see

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
here there's some type of building

132
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
kind of looks european in nature we've

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,639
got our elf standing there with some

134
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
folks in the background definitely looks

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
like a kind of a high visibility tourist

136
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
location so what should we do to find

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
out where this picture was taken well

138
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
since it looks like a recognizable

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
landmark we're going to ask uncle larry

140
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
and uncle sergey where we think this

141
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,840
possibly could be and so going back to

142
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,479
our open or ocean framework

143
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,199
website we can go through the images

144
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
video docs category go to images look at

145
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
search and you'll see there's a quick

146
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
search to google images if you've never

147
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,520
used google before welcome to the

148
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,759
internet but you may not know about this

149
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,680
feature inside of google that inside of

150
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
google images where the

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
camera icon is if you click that it'll

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
allow you to either provide a url or

153
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
upload an image which then will search

154
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
across the internet and try to match

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
like pictures to that so let's go ahead

156
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
and give that a shot

157
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,759
well as you can see when we take our

158
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,440
picture that was provided to us in image

159
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
one and we upload it we get a couple

160
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
references to some town hall squares but

161
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
we actually get the real building in

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
tallinn uh the capital of estonia it

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,199
says it's italian town hall so look at

164
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
that using google search and with this

165
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,919
image we are easily able to use our open

166
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,759
source tools and locate where this elf

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,440
was during the world tour

168
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,919
moving on to the next picture we see

169
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,120
it's really going to be hard to tell

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
what's going on in this image we've got

171
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
some snow

172
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
looks like it's been

173
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
manicured potentially with some type of

174
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,039
uh maybe snowmobile or snowmachine and

175
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,680
uh

176
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
in a rake it looks like potentially in

177
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,199
the background there are some

178
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
lifts for maybe potentially skiers but

179
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
it does reference the picture says what

180
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,840
resort was the picture taken at well it

181
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
looks like let it snow wanted to play at

182
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
some interesting locations so they

183
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,479
picked a resort so we're going to figure

184
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,240
out where this is i don't know if we're

185
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
going to be able to find anything using

186
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
our previous technique of google search

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
so let's see what else the ossent

188
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,198
framework may provide to us

189
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,759
well here we've got

190
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
a tool inside of image videos and docs

191
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
under images and metadata called the

192
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
exif tool if you have if you're not

193
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
familiar with metadata i made the little

194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
headlines a few years back it's actually

195
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
for those of us in in this field it's an

196
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,599
old old term but a lot of folks know

197
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
what it is these days because of

198
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
some recent media so anyways there's a

199
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
tool called xftool an xf tool allows you

200
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,479
to read and write and edit the meta

201
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,240
information of an image

202
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,479
you can download it from this website

203
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,400
but you can also install it in any linux

204
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,759
distribution with your normal

205
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,639
software repository install tools

206
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,960
so let's go ahead and use this tool

207
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,360
you see that when we run exif tool with

208
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,759
just the command exif tool on this image

209
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,120
we're provided a whole bunch of

210
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
information that's stored in the image

211
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
and of interest to us today is the gps

212
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
lat long position as you can see there

213
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
this image

214
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
when the picture was taken stored it was

215
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
at 41 degrees 6 minutes and various

216
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,599
number seconds 75 degrees and 39

217
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,919
minutes and that's north and west so

218
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
using some other mapping locate mapping

219
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
software on the internet entering our

220
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
information we provided we can see that

221
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,599
this plots to a lodge on jack frost

222
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
mountain road in

223
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
kinder township or kitter township in

224
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
pennsylvania

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,879
jack frost mountain huh i wonder if the

226
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,039
leaded snow is making fun of our villain

227
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,560
from previous

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
kringle con and holiday hack challenges

229
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
so as you can see here we have a little

230
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,039
warning that when you upload pictures to

231
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
the internet you need to be aware if

232
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
your social media tool automatically

233
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
strips geolocation data in it from it or

234
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
you need you should do it yourself you

235
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
also in your cameras if you use a phone

236
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
or other type of cameras you can disable

237
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,039
the ability to store geo location data

238
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,120
so using the exif tool looking at the

239
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
metadata we were able to figure out

240
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560
where

241
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
this picture was taken

242
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
all right let's move on to our third and

243
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,120
final image so this image really looks

244
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,958
challenging so we've got our elf

245
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,200
standing in front of a bus and a street

246
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,479
sign

247
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,839
you can't really tell much from the

248
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,880
terrain

249
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,600
looks like some evergreen trees

250
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,399
but

251
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
i wonder what we could do here well if

252
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,519
you'll notice that we kind of pay

253
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
attention we've got a bus with a seven

254
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
digit number

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,560
that's interesting but we've got a url

256
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,519
so let's let's use that url and maybe

257
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,800
some other stuff from the image and

258
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,200
figure out what we can do

259
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
so if we go to this url it'll

260
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,880
automatically redirect to this site and

261
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,360
it apparently fnsb

262
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,560
is

263
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
talking about the fairbanks northstar

264
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
bureau well actually when you go to the

265
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
slash max

266
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
url it's going to take us to the

267
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,399
metropolitan area commuter system and

268
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
you can see the buses well we know we

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
got a bus and so looking at the bus

270
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,959
route

271
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
which is provided on this website we're

272
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
not really able to tell exactly where

273
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
this is but we do see the mention of

274
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
fifth avenue well in the fairbanks main

275
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
area there's not much

276
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,800
you can see on them on the map about any

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,279
stops near 5th avenue but the north pole

278
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
area which is adjacent

279
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
to fairbanks alaska there's a mention of

280
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
8th avenue so i think we should probably

281
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
start looking in the north pole area for

282
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,640
our elf

283
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,240
so google

284
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920
spending some time looking at the map

285
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,000
and doing google street view we can see

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,560
that the richardson highway there is

287
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,399
that street sign that we just saw at the

288
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
fifth avenue

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
fifth avenue next right if we look this

290
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
is where our elf is standing looking

291
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
over here at this building and when we

292
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,880
kind of pan over in google earth or

293
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
google street view rather we see that

294
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
this is the santa claus house and santa

295
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
claus house is a santa claus themed

296
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,440
house and gift shop but this definitely

297
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
makes sense as a place that

298
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
letted snow would want to perform

299
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,880
so as you can see we're able to use

300
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
landmarks and street signs to find uh

301
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,399
places yeah not people we're not

302
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
stalking people we're stalking elves

303
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
okay

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,519
so as you can see

305
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,920
in summary open source tools are very

306
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,000
useful to find things on the website on

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,720
the web or on the internet in addition

308
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
to image searches but finding elves is

309
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,959
always a challenge as they are always

310
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,480
out there handing out bits to everyone

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,959
now only if letted snow had posted their

312
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
tour dates online this might have been a

313
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
little bit easier

314
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
well i appreciate you coming to my

315
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
kringlecon 4 talk just remember open

316
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
source tools are good but there are some

317
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
ways that you can protect yourself as

318
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
we've talked about

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,839
thanks a lot

320
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
hope to see you around the con if you

321
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
see me i'm mad i be great to talk to you

322
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,480
take care
