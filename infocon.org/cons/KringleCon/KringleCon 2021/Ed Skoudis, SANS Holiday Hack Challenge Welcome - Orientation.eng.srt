11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
this year's challenge with you all

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,760
now you might think that i don't look

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
much like ed scotus but here at the

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,079
north pole this is how i look when you

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,520

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
hack challenge you'll get an avatar too

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,280
i'll show you in a bit how you can

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,960
customize your look for this year's

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,440
challenge but first let's look at the

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,760
controls in the upper right hand side of

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,800
the screen

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
we've got a help button that looks kind

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
of like a question mark

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,760
also you can turn music on or off

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
and you can show or hide the chat

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
by the way to use the in-game chat just

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,600
hit the enter key anywhere on your

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
browser

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,159
and the chat entry at the bottom of the

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
screen will get the focus you can then

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,240
type things and hit enter and it will

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
display them above your character as

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,479
well as in the chat scroll on the right

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
hit enter again and then you can type

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,400
more into the chat

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
if you'd rather use discord for chatting

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
instead of the in-game chat

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,560
we have a link here so you can go

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
directly to our discord server and join

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
any one of the channels there that are

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
associated with the holiday hack now if

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
you look at the gear icon that's how you

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
can change settings for your account you

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,479
can mute audio you could hide chats you

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
could hide chat bubbles above players

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,759
and non-player avatars you can even hide

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
other players if you find the world's

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
getting a little too crowded for you you

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
can make everybody disappear so you can

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,320
focus on your objective

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
now i'm just going to click on exit to

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
go back to the main screen

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,560
if i click on this little head icon

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
it'll let me alter my avatar you can

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
change your color scheme

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
or you can change your head you can

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
change your eyes and so forth now i kind

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,280
of like mine the way it is so i'm just

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
gonna click on close

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
now next up we've got the home button

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,599
you can click on that button with a

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,520
little house in it to go all the way

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
back to the very start of the game so if

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
you ever get stuck or want to quickly

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
teleport back to the very start of the

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
game you just click on that little house

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,959
button and finally we have our log off

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,120
button i don't want to log off right now

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
so i'm going to walk around a little bit

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
more and move on to the rest of the game

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
but next let's take a look at our badge

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
when you get to kringlecon you'll pick

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
up your badge near the entrance your

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
badge looks like a little gift at the

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,480
center of your avatar kind of like a

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
wrapped present when you click on it

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
you'll see sections associated with

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,239
story

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,599
objectives

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,760
items and more

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,319
the story unfolds as you move around the

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,640
world and solve objectives so you'll see

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
the story building as you get further

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
through the objectives now these

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,560
objectives are the challenges you need

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,959
to solve they're a pretty big deal

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,360
because these objectives are what makes

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
the holiday hack challenge a challenge

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,120
the items are things you pick up by

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,440
walking over them they include some of

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
the virtual tech gear that you'll need

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,360
to solve some of the challenges there's

93
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,159
also a link in your badge to the kringle

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,599
con talks

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,080
you can click on it and then access any

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
of the talks at the conference

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,959
now some of those talks include hints

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
for the various challenges or as you

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,799
wander around the world up here at the

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,959
north pole you can walk into some of the

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
rooms and they will feature some of

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,680
those talks but the easiest way to get

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,920
to all of the kringle contacts is

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
through your badge

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,879
now again i'm going to hit exit to move

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,560
out of my badge

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
next i'd like to wander around the north

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
pole to see if anyone is up here that i

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,400
can talk with

110
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
oh and here i see santa and the four

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,319
calling birds

112
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,799
i can talk with santa by clicking on his

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,200
avatar and he will tell me some things

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,680
now pay careful attention to what these

115
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,079
non-player characters say

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,519
now as you click on them they will tell

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,358
you more and more but once they get to

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
the end of their dialogue you can just

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
on keep on clicking and they will cycle

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
and show you that dialogue again

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
you'll find that there are various elves

122
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,040
distributed around the north pole these

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
elves are non-player characters that

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
have hints on the objectives for you you

125
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
can click on an elf and then that elf

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
will ask you for help in solving a

127
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
technical challenge

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,479
if you help an elf solve a short

129
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,440
challenge

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
that elf will provide hints for a more

131
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,280
complex objective so in a sense the

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
elves are effectively our hint system at

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,880
the north pole

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
so please feel free to explore santa's

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
castle as well as all the other new

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,639
areas of the north pole that we have in

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,800
store for you this year have fun working

138

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,840

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,560
