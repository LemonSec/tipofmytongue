00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,200
hello kringlecon oh boy that was a long

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,960
ride to the north pole but i wouldn't

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,119
have missed it for the world thank you

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,439
santa for the invite my name is nancy

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
yeshi and today i'm going to talk about

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,519
how you can disclose security

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,000
vulnerabilities to open source projects

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
like a boss

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
open source software is everywhere and

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,160
leveraged by developers around the world

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,079
they use it to build other solutions

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,399
that power the ecosystem that we live in

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,879
every single day it's important that we

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,520
keep this software safe we need to work

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
together to make sure that the

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
vulnerabilities that affect them are

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,440
resolved as quickly as possible

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
i'm a senior developers advocates at

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,920
github security lab and a large portion

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,079
of that open source code lives in

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,800
github's repositories our internal

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
research of the vulnerability disclosure

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,680
process says that we could improve open

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
source software security if we enable

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,520
maintainers the developers who build and

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,159
maintain open source projects and

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,320
reporters that i may sometimes call

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
security researchers

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,080
they are the ones who report security

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,799
vulnerabilities to maintainers

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
if we get these two personas to interact

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
and collaborate with each other more

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
efficiently we can achieve the shared

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,680
goal of getting good security fixes

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
in this presentation i want to share

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
three tips to improve that collaboration

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
tip number one

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
clearly establish the rules of

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
engagement if you're a maintainer you'll

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,079
want to make sure that you have a clear

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,880
security policy that is easy to find

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,799
potential contributors who want to

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
report vulnerabilities that affect your

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,240
project

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
should easily figure out how to contact

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
you or a member of your team they should

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
also know exactly how to report it for

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
contributors who want to help by

50
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
reporting a vulnerability it can be

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,079
really frustrating not knowing how to

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,639
reach out to the people in charge

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,200
take the guesswork out of the whole

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
process or you may have to deal with a

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
bunch of spam emails or even worse if

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,680
you make it too hard they may just

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
decide by sheer frustration to publicly

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
disclose a vulnerability that you don't

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
have a proper patch for

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
you don't want to deal with a critical

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,879
old day drop

62
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,239
you know that

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,040
okay so how do we make that happen

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
well in your repository you can easily

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
add a security md file to define your

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
security policy it really doesn't have

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,200
to be long or complicated

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,519
here's an example from the systemd

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,560
project they provide contact information

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
and a short description of their process

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,920
that's it reporters will be super happy

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
if you have a policy like that because

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
it makes their life so much easier

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,599
as a reporter you can also be clear

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,760
about your expectations and disclosure

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,920
timeline by providing your own

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
disclosure policy

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
here's an example from github security

79
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,959
lab where we detail our policy in less

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,280
than five paragraphs

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
go ahead copy it and customize it if you

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
need one

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
your own disclosure policy can be really

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
helpful to communicate and negotiate

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,159
with maintainers especially if they

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
don't have a security policy of their

87
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,760
own

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,720
however keep an open mind and show some

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
empathy

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
many open source maintainers are often

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,480
not funded or they work on their passion

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,799
project in their free time think about

93
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,480
the possible limitation that could

94
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,120
explain why they can't precisely follow

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
your rules of engagement and meet your

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
expectations

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,480
just in case you don't get my sarcasm

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
do not be drake in that meme

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
tip number two

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,920
write an effective report as i just

101
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
mentioned typical maintainers of open

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,159
source projects are often working on

103
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,720
personal time without funding being on

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
the receiving end of a vulnerability

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
report when you're overworked tired

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
stressed and generally worried that

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,280
something bad is going on with your

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,399
project

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,720
doesn't sound like a good time

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
they may have to pause their paying

111
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
full-time job to fix something critical

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
on their open source project to protect

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,040
the people who are consuming and

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
leveraging their software

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
think of your vulnerability reports as

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759
contributions that are more than calling

117
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
their baby ugly make your report

118
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,479
actionable easy to triage verify and fix

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,199
help them identify the vulnerability but

120
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
also provide a clear actionable solution

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
when possible

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
be clear on the potential impact of the

123
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
vulnerability so that maintainers can

124
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,560
easily understand its criticality

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
precisely point out the code that is

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
responsible for their vulnerability and

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
suggest the fix they may decide to

128
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,440
remediate it differently than what you

129
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,960
suggested

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
still offer to be helpful you have a

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
unique background as a security

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
professional and they'll be grateful for

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,320
your constructive input

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,880
a proof of concept a poc

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
helps maintainers understand the bug

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,720
even reproduce it consider that it's not

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,280
because they built an awesome component

138
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,600
that many people use that it means that

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
they have the same level of proficiency

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,639
and security as you do as a reporter and

141
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,720
a security researcher

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,759
again

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
empathy and understanding can go a

144
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,280
really long way

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
want extra brownie points

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
inform maintainers that you're willing

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,639
to help review their fix ask them to

148
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,280
create a private patch environment so

149
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,680
that you can discreetly work together

150
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,759
until it's ready to be publicly

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
disclosed you'll be surprised how many

152
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,240
maintainers don't know they can even do

153
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,199
that

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
ask for it and even show them if they

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
don't know about it

156
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
writing an effective report helps boat

157
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,520
maintainers and reporters get to agree

158
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
on how bad is that bug and it helps them

159
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,440
decide how high a particular fix should

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
be on the project's long list of

161
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,240
competing priorities

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
final tip tip number three

163
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,600
notify notify notified three times

164
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
the disclosure of a vulnerability

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
doesn't end with a vulnerability report

166
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,400
it also doesn't end with the release of

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
a patch what good is a patch if no one

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
knows it exists or that there was even a

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
problem to begin with the disclosure

170
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,080
process truly ends when everyone who may

171
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
be affected by it is aware they need to

172
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,759
know

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
notify users of the vulnerability tell

174
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,560
them clearly how bad it really is and

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
why it should matter to them

176
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
you can't assume that everyone is

177
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
running the latest version

178
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
give them a path to update to the

179
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
patched version

180
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
if the maintainer opted to use a private

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
github security advisory while you were

182
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,960
collaborating

183
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
making it public will become

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
very useful

185
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
since github is a cna a cve numbering

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
authority when the advisory is published

187
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
it becomes available to downstream

188
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
consumers through the cve number

189
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,400
for some projects the now public

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
security advisory will trigger the

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
pandabar alerts that will do a lot of

192
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,280
the let work of notifying other projects

193
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,120
that are leveraging the vulnerable

194
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
component and letting them know they

195
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
should at least consider fixing it

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,319
and for projects that have enabled

197
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,400
depend about security updates

198
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
the pandabot will generate the pull

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
request that will do the update for them

200
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
it makes it really easy for the

201
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
downstream consumer to upgrade to the

202
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,319
latest and greatest

203
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
mind blown

204
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,680
okay

205
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
let's review and wrap up

206
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,759
whether you're wearing the maintainers

207
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
or the reporter's hat or even maybe both

208
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
here's what you can do to create a

209
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
positive experience for all and help

210
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,479
secure open source projects like a boss

211
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
if you're a maintainer have a clear and

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,280
easy to find security policy to help

213
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,840
give directions to reporters

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,160
learn how to use a security advisory in

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,919
a private patch environment to

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,879
discreetly collaborate with reporters

217
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,960
do everything you can to notify

218
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
consumers about the vulnerability and

219
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,080
fix

220
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
finally do not forget to credit the

221
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
reporter

222
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,719
if your reporter have a disclosure

223
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,200
policy that will help your collaboration

224
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,959
with the maintainers

225
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
show empathy put yourself in the

226
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,360
maintainer's shoes support a maintainer

227
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
first approach

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
write an effective report with a clear

229
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,360
impact and

230
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,279
include a proof of concept if at all

231
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,320
possible

232
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,279
finally focus on the goal

233
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,959
a fix not calling their baby ugly

234
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,560
that's it for me y'all

235
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,519

know more about how you can use your

238
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
skills to help protect open source

239
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,920
projects follow me and my super smart

240
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
