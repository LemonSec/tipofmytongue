4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,000

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,080
and on my way to the north pole santa

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,400
i want you to provide

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,558
some tips and tricks for getting into

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,399
threat hunting for the abominable

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,360
snowman and i said why

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,399
not

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
so let's get started

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,320
really quick though a note from the

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,200
lawyers that the opinions expressed in

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
this presentation are mine alone and do

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
not necessarily reflect those of my

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
employer and i'm here in my individual

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
capacity

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,559
and for funsies i made a github it's

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,760
under my name cheerio crinklecon 2021

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,400
so the abominable snowman let's call him

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
al for short

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
he has a little bit of a background in

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
cti

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,080
but for the purposes of this talk you

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
don't have to have you don't have to

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,159
come from a cti role

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,360
you can

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
jump right into threat hunting

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
um just need to practice and work

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,040
through some of the suggestions that i

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
gave him for getting into

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
a threat hunting role

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
so we're going to talk about research

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,479
practice

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,720
talking with the professional and then

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,200
finally applying these skills

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
so with research the whole goal is to

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
ask better questions the number one

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
place i usually go to first is sans

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,759
sans has a reading room with a ton of

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,880
articles sans also has the threat

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
hunting summit and i included some links

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
in the github

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
for various uh

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,759
youtube playlists that they have another

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,160
great resource of theirs is the find

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,080
evil poster so just sans all the things

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
sans your life if you can

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
the next suggestion i gave to al

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,959
are workshops and talks so al generally

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,680
tries to attend industry events

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
and whatever is available for him and i

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
said hey

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,519
i was like why don't you prioritize

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,560
threat hunting type talks and workshops

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640
before you go and attend either the

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,120
conferences or or whatever is being

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
offered in the community so

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,760
al said he would do that and youtube is

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
another really great resource for threat

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
hunting videos

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,879
so the next thing i suggested to al was

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,200
to look at hunting tip of the day on

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,160
twitter

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
and to follow all the threat hunting

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
accounts that he possibly can for

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
instance linkedin

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
has a threat hunting account

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
facebook has a threat hunting group

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,519
wherever it is that you feel comfortable

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,519
within the social media

73
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
reach out to the people engage with them

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
ask them ask them questions learn

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
from these industry professionals that

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,159
share openly on social media

77
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
and then the next one i said hey al

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,519
look at all of these amazing discords

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,680
and slacks and they have threat hunting

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
channels with threat hunting

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
professionals that sometimes post in

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,640
there or have conversations i said why

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,599
don't you join those and ask questions

84
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,440
and learn from these amazing people

85

sections

108

a day a night a week it'll help get you

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
into the threat hunting mindset and

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
framework and

111
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
take a look at attack look at the

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,520
various attack techniques and and uh and

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
the procedures and think about how you

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
would possibly hunt those

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,479
look at current detections available

116
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,199
such as the sigma rules they are amazing

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
they do such a good job take a look at

118
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,919
that and think huh oh that's a really

119
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
interesting way to to to to detect

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
whatever

121
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
that technique is that you're looking at

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
so

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
and size threat thursday so whenever

124
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,199
there's like a big thing that goes on in

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
in the in the world of cyber

126
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
uh you know side usually does something

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
related to that or ransomware and gives

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
you ideas of how you can run a purple

129
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
team operation which also means it gives

130
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
you ideas to hunt that within your

131
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
environment

132
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
so you want to document all of this and

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,479
in the github i go through some of the

134
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
notes that that i've personally taken

135
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,639
and i've suggested to al to take

136
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
whenever whenever he's attending the

137
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,280
talks

138
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,919
or the workshops

139
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,680
so now we're going to go into practice

140
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,560
and the goal with practice is to prepare

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
and i said hey

142
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,000
you know at the current organization

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,160
that you're at out you want to try to

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
get involved with either the sock

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
tickets or preparing reports or

146
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,600
something for other teams within your

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
organization the other thing is training

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,680
get as much hands-on training as you can

149
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,319
and boss of the sock is a really great

150
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,400
way to do that they also have an attack

151
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,199
range that you can play on your own

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,759
um another thing is when you're looking

153
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,680
at and reading all the stuff you're

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,479
reading the the red team reports and

155
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,800
then blogs and the threat reports and

156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
the differ reports and all of that

157
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
think about how you would hunt it

158
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
and then finally another great way to

159
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,600
document what it is that you're learning

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
and how you're progressing

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,680
is to give a talk about what it is that

162
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
you're doing or something that's hunt

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,240
related or adjacent and i'll talk a

164
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
little bit more through something that i

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,840
did

166
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,400
and santa also wanted me to point out

167
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
that

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,479
uh you know the the hunt of hypothesis

169
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,039
development is really important so when

170
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
you're reading all of the stuff you want

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,599
to understand and think about

172
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,080
what would this badness look like for

173
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,800
instance you're reading a red team blog

174
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
what would this look like how would i

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,639
where where would i find it is step

176
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,840
number two and then number three is what

177
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,319
is this search going to look like and

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,520
this is where

179
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,039
the hands-on

180
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,520
uh practical experience is really going

181
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,319
to come in handy

182
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,240
so this part of this talk is about how i

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
applied cyber threat intelligence to a

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
purple teaming exercise and it can also

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,759
double as research that you could

186
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,759
perform when you're

187
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
doing threat hunting and just give you

188
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,400
some high level tips and tricks and i'll

189
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,479
walk through it and and just give you a

190
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,960
high level so this is a hawkeye sample

191
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,840
and threw it in malware bazaar gotta joe

192
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,280
sandbox and joe sandbox provides ttps so

193
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,240
you can deep dive into it a little bit

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,479
and perform a little research and if you

195
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,199
look at stack overflow and atomic red

196
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
team it they provide some wonderful

197
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
resources that you can either use for

198
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,639
hunting or purple team exercises

199
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
and as you're going through this you

200
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
also want to think about behaviors and

201
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,840
also

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
any detections that it's keying on so

203
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,360
this one is a yara rule 2015 looks kind

204
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
of important if you're doing a

205
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
structured threat hunt which i'll

206
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,120
explain in a couple seconds

207
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,639
you want to

208
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
kind of condense this information for

209
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
the threat hunters so they know hey

210
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
you know if they want me to hunt for

211
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
hawkeye in the environment or derivative

212
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
thereof

213
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
i can look at what's already known and

214
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,958
then kind of pivot from there

215
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,279
so providing that additional research

216
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,159
for them could be potentially helpful

217
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,958
masquerading that's a hunt all all in

218
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,279
and of itself

219
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,200
credential access

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,680
and just go through the ttps for a

221
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
malware sample you can do this on your

222
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
own as well and practice

223
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
get practice doing this and being able

224
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
to read this reports and perform their

225
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
research and read the blogs and and all

226
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
the stuff that's out there

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
another thing that's great is the c2

228
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
matrix so i suggested hey

229
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
they have a slingshot vm with the c2

230
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
matrix and you can utilize that to

231
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,680
understand um and look at the c2 traffic

232
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
as well

233
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
so that that it'll only help you become

234
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,399
a better threat hunter

235
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,160
and you want to document your practice

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,279
so the pro the pro time is money so when

237
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,640
you approach a

238
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,720
seasoned threat hunter you want to be

239
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,040
the best mentee you can be and you want

240
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
to give them a time frame of let's say

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
al wants to be

242
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
wants to start interviewing for a threat

243
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,720
hunting role in approximately six months

244
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,279
well the experienced threat hunter will

245
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,120
help you narrow it down and guide your

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
focus and your learning let's say as a

247
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,640
year that's more time to devote to

248
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
learning what you need to learn in order

249
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
to get into a threat hunting role

250
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
biggest suggestion i can give you is to

251
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,480
come with questions and be very specific

252
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,760
with uh with outcomes and goals tied to

253
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
the conversation that you have with the

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
professional

255
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,120
also too after you're done talking with

256
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
them you want to

257
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
let the pro know how they impacted your

258
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,120
life

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
giving feedback and i don't know a

260
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,079
simple thank you as well is also very

261
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,160
helpful

262
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
so i i copious amounts of notes of

263
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
different professionals that i get to

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
speak with and i learn from and i

265
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,360
incorporate

266
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,399
into

267
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,800
how i threat hunt

268
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
so finally apply

269
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,680
the goal with application is to prepare

270
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,440
you for the interview

271
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,320
and so that once you are hired in a

272
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
threat hunting role you can provide

273
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,279
value immediately right out of the gate

274
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,519
so the first thing that i suggested to

275
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
al is to look at mitre attack and to

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
pick a few different techniques and

277
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
procedures and really understand them

278
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,760
and be able to speak to them in detail

279
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
the next one are cesa

280
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,800
public threat reports and you want to

281
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,360
develop enough hunt hypotheses per

282
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,000
threat hunt or per threat report or

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,839
whatever it is that you're reading for

284
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,959
approximately an hour worth of content

285
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
and this is so that when you're in an

286
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,640
interview they ask you about this or

287
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,200
that or whatever you'll have an hour of

288
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
content to kind of pick through and be

289
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
able to highlight

290
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
the the big takeaways when they're when

291
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
you're having the conversation or the

292
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,720
group interview and finally current

293
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
events you want to stay up with current

294
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,640
events and you want to think about not

295
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
only the

296
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839
technical attack chain of whatever it is

297
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,000
that's going on but also you want to

298
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
think about how you would hunt that

299
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
and be able to speak to that as well

300
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,079
so santa shared his threat hunting cycle

301
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,839
and it starts with research you want to

302
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,560
do hypothesis generation understanding

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
the technical details you go into

304
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,480
analysis

305
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
conclusions and then finally detections

306
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,639
you want to automate the hunts that you

307
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,360
can and why is this important well when

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
you're reading through all of it

309
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
especially when you're in an interview

310
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
you want to keep track of all the stuff

311
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,560
that you're doing as far as the

312
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,839
application

313
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
portion is concerned and you want to be

314
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,320
able to speak to the managers and the

315
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
other experienced threat hunters or

316
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,880
professionals on the call with you and

317
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,399
you want to have a framework that you

318
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,399
can address that with and kind of make

319
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,920
sense of all the learning that you're

320
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
doing

321
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,480
you also want to break it down and this

322
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,079
is where i talk about structured or

323
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,040
known

324
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,600
known ttps ioks and artifacts and

325
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,160
unstructured is unknown so i'm going to

326
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
add another layer of what you want to

327
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,240
look at when you're reading the d4

328
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,800
reporter or any of anything throughout

329
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,320
hunting related is that you want to

330
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,200
think about internal versus external how

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
you would hunt

332
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,639
for cobalt strike beacons in your

333
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,120
environment is different than how you

334
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
would hunt for cobalt strike beacons out

335
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,519
in the wild so just think about that

336
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,639
when you're reading through these

337
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
different reports

338
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,399
also the pyramid of pain no talk would

339
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,600
be complete without david j bianco the

340
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,160
man the myth the legend

341
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,519
and so when you're looking at the

342
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
pyramid of pain you want to focus on

343
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
behaviors

344
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
and tools and artifacts and you want to

345
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,519
look at the host and network related

346
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
information to those

347
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,279
also i suggested hey al while you're

348
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,639
doing all of this

349
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,360
track the time that you're spending on

350
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,519
these three different areas of research

351
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
practice and apply and you can do this

352
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,639
over time and get an idea of where

353
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,800
you're spending more of your time at and

354
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
you can tweak as necessary and this will

355
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
help you kind of get an understanding of

356
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
where your level up

357
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,199
in

358
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,079
activities are

359
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,720
so document your application

360
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,880
like i said this is important during the

361
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,639
interviews and also when you're on the

362
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
job i promise

363
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
that the notes and all the resources

364
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,480
that you document and all the

365
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
information that you have it'll come in

366
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,680
handy at some point in the future so if

367
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,839
you document it and where you find it

368
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,760
it'll be helpful

369
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,720
so some of the main takeaways research

370
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
main goal of that is to be able to ask

371
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
better questions

372
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
and to know

373
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
where to find stuff

374
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,440
there's so much stuff out there the

375
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,199
faster you know to find it the faster

376
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,880
you can get the answer the faster you

377
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,519
can hunt the badness and

378
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,199
solve whatever problem it is that you're

379
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,320
looking at

380
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
next one practice you want to day dream

381
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,839
hunt hypotheses

382
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,480
someone talks about some sort of attack

383
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,959
how would i hunt that and then run that

384
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,440
through the hunt uh dev development

385
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
process and then the hunt cycle

386
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
and it helps you prepare so that way

387
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
you know if you're cso or your vp or

388
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
your manager or whomever director comes

389
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,800
to you and they're like you know we need

390
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
to hunt this because it's a big deal

391
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,120
you'll be like i got this i've already

392
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,360
been thinking about it and here's how i

393
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
would do it

394
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,519
finally apply you want to make sure that

395
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,800
you're practical that you're consistent

396
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
and the end goal with this

397
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
besides being super awesome day one on

398
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,639
the job

399
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,560
is to prepare for the interview

400
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,720
so thank you very much i hope you all

401
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,560

with you

404
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
will help lay out some sort of framework

405
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,519
for you to approach

406
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,440
pivoting into a threat hunting role

407
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
wherever you come from if that's your

408
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,399
interest i know al of the abominable

409
