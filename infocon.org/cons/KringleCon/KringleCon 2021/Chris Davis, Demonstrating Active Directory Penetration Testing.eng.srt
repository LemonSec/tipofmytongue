00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
hello welcome to kringlecon my name is

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,920
chris davis and i work for counter hack

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
challenges i'm going to be demonstrating

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
active directory penetration testing

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,359
using kerberosting bloodhound and

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
powershell

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320
okay so before we start what i'm going

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
to be demonstrating is how to manipulate

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,720
active directory in a number of

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,719
different techniques and methods to go

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,559
from a limited user escalating all the

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,880
way up to the highest user privileges

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,280
possible typically domain admins the

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,040
reason why i wanted to do a

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,640
demonstration on this is because very

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
often what you'll see is you'll have

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
individual talks talking about one

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
particular thing for example curb

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
roasting only what it is conceptually or

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
how to use bloodhound or how to use

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
power view but a lot of times they don't

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,520
connect the full dots of here's how you

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,680
go from start to finish and so that's

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,239
what i'm going to be demonstrating here

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
however there are some really great

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
talks i'll link to those two here in a

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,200
moment but again that this demonstration

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
is really just to kind of connect all

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,080
the dots show you how to use all these

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
tools and methods and also a little bit

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,479
of endpoint protection evasion

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,000
so as i go through the demonstration try

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
to keep in mind that it might seem

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
somewhat contrived in arbitrary and

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
that's just because we're on a limited

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,640
time and it's also pretty difficult to

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,040
emulate a live network perfectly

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
however you will likely find some of

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
these tools and techniques helpful

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
during your penetration testing and you

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,320
might also even find it useful at

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,040
kringle con and frost fest

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,439
so a lot of the resources that i either

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
talk about or actively use during this

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
demonstration can be found using any of

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
these links

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
i don't go into a lot about what these

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,159
actually are or what the underlying

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,560
technology is only because i think that

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,079
would be outside of the scope of this

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
demonstration however i do provide some

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,119
links to a lot of these resources for

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
example tim madine's talk there at the

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
very top on curb roasting which is

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,880
absolutely excellent he covers it in

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
complete detail way better than i ever

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,479
could i would highly recommend you

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,840
checking out that talk and some of these

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
other links in addition to that that

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
certain point i will use some custom

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,440
code snippets that i created to evade

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,040
endpoint protection

64
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
these can be found at that bottom link

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
at the very bottom of this page here

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
okay now let's jump over to our

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
demonstration

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,319
okay so we're going to begin our demo

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
here and in this demo i'm going to be

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
essentially demonstrating what an

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
assumed breach assessment would look

72
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,040
like this is where

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
a company hires you to and they give you

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
limited access to their environment they

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
usually give you a laptop or like some

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
kind of remote access with a limited

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
domain user account and your job is to

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
essentially try to escalate permissions

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
as high as you can possibly go on the

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
domain typically trying to get domain

81
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,040
admin and so that's what i'm going to

82
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,120
demonstrate here using the

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,200
bloodhound framework but also kerber

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,519
hosting the network uh

85
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
cracking some service account hashes

86
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
using those hashes to pivot to another

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
account and then finally leveraging and

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,879
exploiting

89
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
uh some improper permissions on some

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
group objects which will allow us to get

91
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,879
domain admin

92
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,680
so i have i am sitting here with the

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,480
domain vulns.local i already have some

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,319
scripts set up here to begin with we're

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,760
going to go ahead and run

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
bloodhound collector in this case it's a

97
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,920
powershell script called sharp hound now

98
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
very often times this script won't work

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
because you're going to have very solid

100
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,599
endpoint protection that's going to

101
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,200
prevent this from running

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
in this case i'm just trying to do a

103
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
demo and the case that you do run into a

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,840
situation where you have strong endpoint

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,360
protection though you can use something

106
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,319
like a sharp hound the c-sharp project

107
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,640
you would have to download visual studio

108
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
community and then download the original

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,120
c-sharp source code for sharp hound and

110
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
then recompile it

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
usually you have to tweak some things in

112
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,159
order to make it to where av doesn't

113
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,920
pick up on it but that's typically what

114
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,480
i do on a lot of assessments

115
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
so in this case i'm going to import this

116
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,879
module here

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,679
attack module

118
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,920
okay so that's imported

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,159
now as long as this machine is domain

120
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,640
join i should be able to just do invoke

121
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
bloodhound collection method all

122
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,640
we'll see what happens

123
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,200
should run it might take a moment or two

124
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
so

125
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
we'll let this run and get back to you

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,639
in a second

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
okay so now that that is complete we

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
should have a zip file here that the

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
bloodhound ran for the collector

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
we're gonna go ahead and copy this over

131
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
to our kali instance that has the

132
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
bloodhound front end interface set up so

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
we'll go over to that now

134
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
okay so on here we have bloodhound setup

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
and i have already imported the database

136
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,160
and in here we can actually see the

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
database info info it's populated with

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
users computers groups for our domain

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
in this case we have

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
the domain users object showing up here

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,520
and we can actually see that there are

142
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,198
207 domain users

143
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
and the interface is pretty easy to use

144
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
that's one of the beautiful things about

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
bloodhound

146
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,919
is

147
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,880
it's

148
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
takes all this huge amounts of data and

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
then

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
visualizes it for you in such a way that

151
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,080
it's easy to pivot through data so in

152
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,199
this case what we are curious in is the

153
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
shortest path to domain admins and

154
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,560
what's beautiful about this is it

155
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
already has pre-built queries there's

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
very few times where i've ever need to

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
break outside of these pre-built queries

158
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,639
because they pretty much get me

159
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,560
everywhere i need to get so in this case

160
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,759
we'll click on the pre-built queries

161
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,919
we'll go find shortest path to domain

162
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
admins

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
and here we have our domain admins and

164
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,120
then we have everything that springs off

165
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,639
of it that if we had access to one of

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
these things there it is potentially

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
possible for us to gain domain app okay

168
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
so here we have the remote employee user

169
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
and it has right tackle permissions on

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,199
the ad group object domain admins and if

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
we right click that we can actually

172
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
click on help and it'll have the abuse

173
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
info section here and this is

174
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,680
essentially a step-by-step how to abuse

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
it to where you can gain access to

176
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,919
domain admins in this case if we had the

177
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,600
power view project

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
we could uh leverage that to give

179
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,560
ourselves or add ourselves to the domain

180
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,479
admins group

181
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,080
using the steps around here in this

182
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,919
demonstration we are actually not going

183
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,520
to use this but you certainly could use

184
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,960
power view again you would just need to

185
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,638
click on the abuse info section

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,639
but we do know that we need to get

187
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
access to remote employee now next what

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
we want to do is we want to see if we

189
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,000
can find a list of kerberos accounts

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
so if we click on

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
vols service so if we click on this

192
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
account

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
what we find here is some useful

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,639
information

195
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,000
so there's a little bit of a strip

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
description here it says used by the i t

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
admins to run scripts can run scripts in

198
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,599
the it share

199
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,919
okay so let's see if we can kerberos

200
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,440
this account

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,919
get its account hash and then crack that

202
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,360
hash

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,199
all right so so to do that

204
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,880
let's jump back over to our windows 10

205
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
box we need to find out what our server

206
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,080
is or what our domain controller is

207
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
so now what we want to do is actually

208
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
let's just take a look at that

209
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
let's uh look at the shares available on

210
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
it oh there's an it share that's

211
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,560
interesting

212
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
okay so what we want to do is we want to

213
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
use the

214
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,160
uh get user spns as part of the impact

215
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,280
software

216
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
that can be found on github now a lot of

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
times you're not going to have a machine

218
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
that has python installed on here you

219
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,479
can use the pi installer

220
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
suite to compile

221
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,639
this python script and then run it as an

222
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,960
executable on the windows machine

223
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,680
you can also use this from any host

224
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
essentially that has network access so

225
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,919
there's been times where i had access to

226
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
a linux host and i was able to run this

227
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,120
as well

228
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,000
there is also a invoke kerberos

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,919
powershell script that you can use this

230
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,680
with and i believe there's also the

231
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
rubius project which will allow you to

232
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
compile your own binary and essentially

233
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,479
run the same thing in this case again

234
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,520
for the demo i'm just going to go ahead

235
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
and run this script

236
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
as if i had python on system

237
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
so here we have my limited user account

238
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
with my limited user password i'm going

239
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
to go ahead and run this against the

240
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
domain controller

241
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,879
and

242
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,360
we are going to

243
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
i don't know if that's the correct dc

244
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,239
yeah i think it is

245
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
it's going to take you just a moment to

246
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
run and when it's done we should have

247
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
ours

248
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,240
our hash

249
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
all right so let's take this hash and

250
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
we're going to go ahead and load that up

251
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
into hashcat

252
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
okay so i've copied this over we have

253
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,279
our file here called spns.txt

254
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,519
again we just have our one

255
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,160
service account hash in there we're

256
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
gonna go ahead and run our hash cat

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,279
command to

258
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
all right so we got hash cat running we

259
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
are going to be using the best 64 rule

260
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,279
set on this

261
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
and then we're using just a simple

262
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
file called rocky.txt it's actually a

263
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
really small password list it's it's

264
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
commonly used in ctfs in this case again

265
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
i'm just doing a demonstration to crack

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,480
the hash

267
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,720
and what do we know we have a cracked

268
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,440
hash so it is the password for the the

269
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
vols underscore svc account is simpsons

270
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,480
zero

271
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
okay so uh back over to our windows

272
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
machine here we actually saw earlier

273
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
that we have the itshare available on

274
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
the windows domain controller and

275
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,320
according to what we found

276
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
in bloodhound the that account had

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,959
access to the itshare found in the

278
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,279
description for the account so let's go

279
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,080
ahead and run a command prompt as that

280
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
user

281
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
so we're going to go ahead and run as no

282
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,519
profile vol service

283
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,080
we need to put in the correct password

284
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,399
that we got

285
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
okay so using our new command prompt

286
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
running as the vols service account we

287
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
should be able to

288
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,399
net view

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
that file share on the domain controller

290
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
and we do see that there

291
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
and then we can use a unc file path to

292
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
actually list the contents of that

293
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,760
folder

294
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,519
so if we do that and it share

295
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
yep we in fact are able to list the

296
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
contents of that directory remotely so

297
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
let's go ahead and copy that file off

298
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
there it looks kind of juicy says get

299
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
proc info let's see what's on that

300
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
you can also just cat it if we need to

301
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
but

302
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,320
see if we can copy it over here

303
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,880
all right

304
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
so now that we got the file copied off

305
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,839
using the account hash that we cracked

306
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,160
all right let's go ahead and take a look

307
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,240
at what's in this file here

308
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
that was found on the it

309
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,120
share

310
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
ah what do you know some ite person was

311
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,959
uh generous enough to leave their

312
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
credentials in a file here

313
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
that's interesting so we it's actually

314
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,519
the account that we saw earlier so let's

315
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,560
actually see if we can pull that up here

316
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,079
but now we pretty much have the

317
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,519
credentials for this account let's see

318
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
if we can

319
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
pull this guy up in

320
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,839
bloodhound

321
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,880
and then let's uh go ahead and mark this

322
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,959
as

323
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,519
mark user as owned now that we have this

324
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,440
user marked as owned we can actually do

325
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,560
a new query

326
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
we can do

327
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,540
show shortest path from owned principles

328
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,440
[Music]

329
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
and what do you know we have a direct

330
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
path to domain admins as i as we had saw

331
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
earlier so it looks like the remote

332
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
employee account

333
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,959
has the right tackle permissions to the

334
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,839
domain admins ad group now what this

335
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,200
means is

336
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
you have the ability to change the

337
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
tackle permissions of the 80 group

338
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
object domain admins which means you can

339
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,079
actually set the permissions such that

340
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
you can add yourself into the group and

341
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,279
then once you're in the group your

342
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,680
domain admin right again we can use that

343
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,959
we can actually accomplish that using

344
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,680
the power view suite in this case again

345
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
i'm actually going to show you another

346
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
way because a lot of times what happens

347
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
is if the power view suite is is going

348
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,440
to be picked up by

349
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
every endpoint protection and so what we

350
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
want to do is come up with our own

351
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
script or a modified version of power

352
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
view that won't be picked up but there's

353
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,519
actually just regular powershell script

354
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
blocks that one could use to accomplish

355
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,680
the same things essentially and that's

356
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
what we're going to show here in just a

357
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,639
moment so let's go back over to the

358
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,320
other machine

359
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
since we're very close to getting domain

360
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,880
admin

361
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
okay so we have our credentials here

362
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
that we found on itshare from popping

363
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
that account using

364
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
kerberosting

365
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,200
so we should actually be able to verify

366
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
that information so we can use power

367
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,399
view or we can use bloodhound to see

368
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
that there was the the right tackle

369
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,959
permissions by the remote employee user

370
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,959
we should be able to verify that without

371
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,320
those frameworks though because a lot

372
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
again a lot of times those will be

373
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,680
blocked by endpoint protections

374
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
uh so in this instance i have a little

375
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
short code snippet that you can see here

376
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
so let me go ahead and expand the screen

377
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,519
oh whoops i forgot to uncomment them uh

378
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,519
so this is one short code snippet we can

379
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,320
use

380
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,279
and we in this uh once we run this it

381
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,000
should query and we should see a remote

382
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
employee user

383
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
has that right tackle permission set uh

384
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
oh there it is right there so we can

385
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
actually see that the

386
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
right deco permission was given or is

387
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
granted to the remote employee so it

388
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
means we can add ourselves

389
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,160
give ourselves generic all permissions

390
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
and then add ourselves to the group

391
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,199
here's another short clip we can use to

392
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,680
do essentially the same thing

393
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
to query the domain admins group and get

394
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
the right access permissions

395
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
again it gives us essentially the same

396
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
results

397
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,959
okay so what we want to do in this

398
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
situation is to

399
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,199
uh here's another script that we can use

400
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,800
again we can use the power view

401
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,399
framework to do exactly what i'm doing

402
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,199
now

403
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,120
but in this instance

404
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
maybe let's say that endpoint protection

405
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,519
was giving us some heartache so

406
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,880
and so essentially what we're using is

407
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,440
ldap to connect to the domain controller

408
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
we're setting our user account christie

409
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
christy will have generic all which

410
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
should be set here yep so we have the

411
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
generic all permission once we have

412
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
generic all we should have access over

413
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,240
the entire a domain admins group and

414
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
then we can simply add ourselves to the

415
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,440
domain admins group

416
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
okay so to accomplish this here we need

417
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,240
to run as uh the remote employee user so

418
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
we should be able to

419
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
run the same run as command early as we

420
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,440
did earlier

421
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
all right so

422
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,120
run as go ahead and close this

423
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,959
and we're gonna go ahead and give it the

424
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,599
password

425
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
oh whoops

426
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,399
there we go all right so

427
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
now we are running in powershell

428
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,079
or we're running in command prompt

429
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,800
rather but we need to be in powershell

430
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,480
all right so

431
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
let's go ahead and

432
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,399
run that script that we had here before

433
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,160
all right so let's go ahead and run that

434
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,880
okay so if that's finished correctly we

435
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,839
should see our account christie has been

436
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,839
added so we can run that query that we

437
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
ran that other time

438
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,399
to get the permissions on the object

439
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,320
see if that changed

440
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
all right let's take a

441
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,160
look oh there it is okay so our christie

442
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,639
account has now been given generic all

443
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,120
access

444
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
using this little code snippet that we

445
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
came up with

446
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
all right so now that we've been given

447
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
generic all access we need to add

448
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,160
ourselves to the group now unfortunately

449
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,800
um we can't just run the

450
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,360
a lot of the standard commands like net

451
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
add you know users and

452
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
add a user to ad group using powershell

453
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,240
because a lot of those will get access

454
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,399
denied so we're gonna have to actually

455
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,480
use a powershell code block in order

456
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
that we could also use the power views

457
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
uh framework um so in this case we're

458
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
gonna do the same thing again we have

459
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,480
another script block here

460
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
that we're gonna use in this case

461
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,120
and so again uh we are set the domain

462
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,839
admins user and i have my account here

463
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,680
with my password

464
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,639
and this script block should add us to

465
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,199
the domain admins account here

466
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,039
so let's take a look here

467
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,880
all right so again using the the

468
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
powershell prompt that we had run as

469
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,520
the remote underscore employee user we

470
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
should be able to just

471
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,720
paste all that in

472
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,559
and now that works correctly we should

473
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,240
be in the domain admins

474
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,160
all right and so if that worked properly

475
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
then what we should be able to do is uh

476
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,599
check that group so net group domain

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,120
admins domain

478
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
and voila there's our user account

479
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,559
christy

480
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,880
who is now in the domain admins group so

481
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
let's go ahead and use our credentials

482
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,600
to

483
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,919
go ahead and remote into the windows

484
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
domain controller

485
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,760
and we're in okay so again just to

486
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,480
confirm that

487
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,440
okay so that's it i hope you found that

488
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
demonstration useful and will help you

489
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,720
in your future active directory

490
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
penetration testing

491
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,440
endeavors and or at kringlecon frostfest

492
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
this year so you should definitely go

493
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
check those out my name is chris davis
