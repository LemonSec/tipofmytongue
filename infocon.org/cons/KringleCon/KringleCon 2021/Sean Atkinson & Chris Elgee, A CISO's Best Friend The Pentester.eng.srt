00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,400
welcome to ascizzo's best friend the pen

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,199
tester my name's sean atkinson sizzo for

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,920
the center for internet security and i'm

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,880
here with my best friend chris elgi hey

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,000
chris

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,640
hey sean how's it going

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,679
do you have a good time making it up

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,760
here to the north pole took me a while

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
but i got here eventually

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,079
you get a little farther to go than i do

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,079
but not much

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
uh yeah and i'm chris lg i'm with

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,760
counter hack challenges we of course

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
make the holiday hack and other range

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,760
products and we also do a fair bit of

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,200
pen testing

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,360
i'm glad to be here with sean uh one of

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
one of my best friends

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,719
so we want to talk about consulting with

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
the enemy and getting past

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,160
this us versus them ideal so we'll add

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
some reasons why we'll talk about blue

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,840
responsibilities

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
chris will talk about red and then we'll

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
conclude

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,360
so let's move into why so why it pen

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,600
testing really only exists because it

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,759
makes blue better makes a defensive

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,280
posture more resilient and pen testing

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
is not a red versus blue exercise this

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,960
is not a competition what it is is to

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,520
understand and bring value

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
to an organization through pen testing

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
and really the ultimate why here is to

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,040
understand

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,799
how we're going to do that so we're

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,520
building risk mitigating capabilities

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
we need pen testers to assess the

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
strengths and weaknesses of that

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,640
capability to provide value back

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,479
so it provides expert assessment

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,159
utilizing ttps to prove resiliency of

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
controls and identify those weaknesses

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,479
so value is not generated from a blue

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,399
perspective if we're going to restrict

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,880
the scope on what pentesters can do we

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
need to open up we need to allow pen

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,759
testers access into our infrastructure

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,000
beyond layers of defense in order to

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,239
test those layers if any one of those

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,680
were to fail

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,400
and success is not scored as a clean

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,599
report

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
really need to emphasize that this is

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
not a grading exercise this is to

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
identify value and continual improvement

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,760
and for any organization and we'll use

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,120
the cis critical security controls 18.

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,599
this should be the force multiplier of

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
your security program

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,680
so let's move in then to blue

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
responsibilities so we have violet here

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
looking at her risk strategy

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
and what she did and we'll move on to

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
the responsibilities here is with a

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
restricted scope thinking everything

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
not really thinking everything through

69
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,519
from a risk perspective blew up and

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,599
that's because there was not enough red

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,560
and violet turned into a blueberry

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
so what we need to do in order to avoid

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
that is identify our own goals we're

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,400
going to look at compliance we're going

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
to understand business risk and this is

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
not security theater this is not

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,200
something to get a report clean report

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
we're perfect in every way shape and

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,519
form that's not what we're trying to do

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,599
this needs scope so we need to look at

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,720
new web web applications we need annual

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,799
review we've got to look at on-premise

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,480
infrastructure we've got to look at

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,799
cloud physical wireless social

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,959
engineering bring all of that to the

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
table because in each layer of this

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,599
infrastructure weaknesses lie and we

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,280
need to find them

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
we want permissive rules of engagement

90
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,840
so it's okay to have checkpoints we want

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
to have communication we need this

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,840
backwards and forwards between the two

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
teams in order for us to become best

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,959
friends

95
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,159
we're going to lay the cards on the

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
table we're forwarding alerts we're

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,879
looking at open source code we've got

98
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
known weaknesses that we're sharing

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,680
through past reports and also change

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,239
management to identify what we've done

101
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
to improve since the last pen test

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,640
planting flags is also good as well this

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,319
allows multiple stages of alerts and

104
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
really findings to be exposed through

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
this process

106
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,238
having those flags identified shows

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,560
which layer of our infrastructure either

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
was weak or which was not found is

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
strong we want to gamify the experience

110
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
we want to check in with the pentest

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,000
team and do the detection game we found

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,919
you at this level of alert and allowing

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
us to report that back to the pen tester

114
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
to know the avenues uh that are working

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,479
and those that are not

116
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
the findings are not for shaming we've

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
got to appreciate that this is found by

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,040
our friends not the adversary who do we

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
want to find these issues within our

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
infrastructure i'd rather be a friend

121
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,400
than an enemy and we want to contin the

122
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
continuity of the engagement really is

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
make sure they come back and test again

124
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
next time we will make it more difficult

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,039
for you friend that's the adage we need

126
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
to have with our pen test teams in order

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
for them to come back and see what we've

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,479
done to continuously improve

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,280
over to you chris thanks don you know as

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,120
you go through that it makes me think of

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
uh

132
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
a professor x and magneto you know

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,120
they're they're they're enemies but

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
they're friends and they they keep

135
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,759
coming back to that chess table over and

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,720
over again

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
uh maybe maybe less of a good friend

138
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,320
would be someone like like biff tan in

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,639
here and we don't want to be biftin as

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
pet testers because you may end up in a

141
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,199
pile of stink um the the first thing we

142
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
we need to make sure we're doing on the

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
pentest side it's get back to what sean

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
said they have goals there are reasons

145
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
they're having a pen test maybe it's

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,479
compliance or something like that but

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,240
probably they actually want to know

148
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,039
where their security uh concerns are as

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,120
it relates to business risk right and

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
and that never means that the the

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
president wants to see how many

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
shells you can get the the company

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,680
president has no idea what domain

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,919
administrator is most likely

155
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,919
um although probably not not true in

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,479
sean's case it's very technical uh we

157
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,000
also want to check in all the time right

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
we at least once a day we want to say

159
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
hey this is how far we've gotten these

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
are the things we've tried

161
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
this is what we're going to try next or

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
maybe in the middle of the day hey i

163
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,400
just found this this old service i think

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
i can throw this exploit at it and get a

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
shell

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
is is now a good time is this an okay

167
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,160
thing to test

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
because we don't want to end up in a

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
pile of manure

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,919
um i i will tell you one time i did

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,840
throw something at a at an edge router

172
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
that i thought would be a cool exploit

173
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
and it ended up just just kind of

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
locking the thing up pretty hard so this

175
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
this small financial was disconnected

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,680
from the internet for a few minutes

177
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
while they while they rebooted the

178
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,919
device

179
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,240
learn from my mistakes um how about this

180
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,319
too make make sure you do get caught at

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
least once during the test right like

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080
like sean said this can be a game thing

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,639
back and forth uh hey did you catch this

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
no i didn't but i but i saw that

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,440
and that that gives them a win in the in

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
the test so that your your report isn't

187
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
just

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,039
here are all the things that you need to

189
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,400
fix but hey here are the things that

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
you're doing really well and that can be

191
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
super meaningful and honestly it makes

192
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,880
the it makes the uh recommendations more

193
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
easily easy to digest when there are

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,120
things that that were seen as as doing

195
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
well and also too gives the organization

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,440
some idea of what types of attacks they

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,919
can detect so it helps them tune their

198
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,400
their detection game don't be the

199
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
naughty pen tester if you're sending

200
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
fishing lures about injured children or

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
uh or back to office requirements with

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
with the pandemics right you you are a

203
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,960
bad pen tester and you're getting a love

204
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,680
of coal so be sure you you don't do that

205
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,759
and and if you happen to find

206
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,479
personally embarrassing information in

207
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,199
in the cfos you know my documents folder

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,080
uh

209
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,000
that's not in scope okay even if it says

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
everything's in scope that that's not

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,160
cool let's let's just uh move along to

212
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
something else

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,879
and then here too we to gauge risk and

214
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,080
to give recommendations that are

215
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
actually going to be implementable by

216
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
the organization we have to communicate

217
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,479
if if we see something like you know ftp

218
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,479
being used back and forth between hosts

219
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,160
to transfer data and say hey you got to

220
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,919
shut that down but we don't understand

221
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,759
that that's core to how they do billing

222
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,039
then that's that's a worthless

223
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,400
recommendation so make sure you're

224
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
talking a lot and understanding what

225
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,960
what really makes sense for for that

226
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,919
group and and also too

227
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,520
again like sean said findings are not

228
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
shaming you you aren't winning either

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,440
right it isn't it isn't they win if it's

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,759
a if it's a blank pentas report and we

231
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,960
win if there are lots of findings

232
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
there's no shaming it's just about about

233
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
helping our friend and making sure that

234
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
they they best understand their risk and

235
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
can move forward and grow in maturity

236
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,958
and then lastly for the report you know

237
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,958
we definitely make a habit of sending

238
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
draft reports to all our clients so that

239
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
they've got a couple of weeks to look at

240
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
it and say geez you know counter hack

241
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
you misinterpreted this this here you

242
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
marked it as a medium or a high but but

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
really that's uh you were just looking

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
at sample code so

245
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
so that never goes to development or

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,040
certainly production so that gives

247
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,880
the client a chance to make the report

248
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,839
something even better

249
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,120
absolutely

250
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
thank you chris and ultimately becomes

251
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
show me the risk so we're having this

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,839
pen test for a reason right this is the

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,160
whole point it's focused on the goals

254
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
not a report guide it's not an

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
assessment of the security team and

256
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,720
whether or not your job's valuable it is

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,800
this is not the format that that should

258
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,399
take this report is here to help us so

259
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
we want to help the pen testers by

260
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
giving a wide scope a capability in our

261
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,279
organization in order to understand

262
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,760
multiple levels of control

263
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,839
we want the opportunity to gauge our

264
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,240
capability to what chris said that win

265
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
allows us to understand where our

266
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
controls are working and whether or not

267
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,839
and again this is not us versus them

268
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
this is friends coming together to make

269
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,480
things better

270
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
right and

271
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
and on the pentest side let's let's

272
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
remember too that that there is a reason

273
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
there's a pen test and and we have to

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
understand what their their reasons are

275
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
and one more time all the shells is not

276
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
the reason

277
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,800
um and then

278
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
in terms of openness if they're giving

279
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
us you know source code to their web

280
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
applications and full network maps um we

281
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
need to make sure we're laying our cards

282
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
on the table as well these are the

283
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
things i'm going to try here's where i

284
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
struggled here here's the exploit i

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,040
tried to run but it just wouldn't fire

286
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,399
these are all useful pieces of

287
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
information for the client and they are

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,079
they are the ones in charge of this this

289
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,600
whole engagement

290
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
and lastly make sure your

291
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,040
recommendations are helpful that they

292
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
fit the organization that you give

293
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
short-term and long-term recommendations

294
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
and maybe some some really cheap ones

295
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,920
and some more involved resource

296
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,839
intensive ones because then the client

297
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
gets things to pick from and it's going

298
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
to be more likely to to be able to

299
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,079
implement something that fits them well

300
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,440
exactly exactly well said chris and like

301
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,519
we've said red exists to make blue

302
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,160
better and blue needs red to define what

303
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,440
is better

304
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
and as we move forward that's the

305
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
engagements we want to see and so we'd

306
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,839
like to thank you uh for being here with

307
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,920
us at the north pole and it wasn't all

308
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,079
bad chris i actually got to got some

309
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,120
