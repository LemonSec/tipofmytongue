2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,679
thank you

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,940
hello this is Professor Cordy petabind

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,560
from Elf University

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,140
and I'm here today to give you a

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,140
presentation titled you can still have

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,400
fun with non-fundable tokens

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,979
sometimes those puns even make me laugh

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,780
what is a non-fungal token well there's

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,059
nothing like opening up a newspaper and

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,940
reading that an animated gif of Nyan Cat

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,780
a flying cat with a Pop-Tart body sold

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,120
for nearly six hundred thousand dollars

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,100
that'll take your interest in this new

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,760
collectible format but what exactly is

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,019
an nft

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,480
non-fungible that word really doesn't

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
help out a whole lot because most people

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
don't know what it means

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,740
non-fungal means something that is

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,900
unique or distinguishable so twins would

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,619
not be non-fungal

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,119
this non-fungible attribute

24
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,979
differentiates nfts from standard

25
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,619
cryptocurrency tokens because crypto

26
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,259
tokens are all the same

27
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,540
you can exchange one for another because

28
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,659
really they're no different

29
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,159
however just like crypto tokens nfts are

30
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,860
based on Smart contracts and live their

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,500
lives on the blockchain

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,740
the contracts are different because they

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,960
need to account for the uniqueness that

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,339
makes nfts special

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,619
but what is it what are people buying

36
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,880
in theory a non-fungal token is a unique

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,840
digital identifier that cannot be copied

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,940
substituted or subdivided and is

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,120
recorded on a blockchain that is used to

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,180
certify authenticity and ownership

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,040
because it's recorded on the blockchain

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,640
it's immutable it can't be changed

43
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,280
so when you've purchased it when you own

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,099
it this single thing this single nft

45
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,440
identifies your relationship to the

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,959
entity that it describes but what

47
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,819
exactly do you own

48
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,640
well I like to use the analogy of a

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,500
baseball card

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,980
you don't own the player on the front of

51
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,599
your baseball card

52
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,120
you don't even own the rights to the

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,760
photo of the player you likely can't

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,739
even republish the information on the

55
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,620
card without getting in trouble with

56
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,959
tops or whoever makes the card or or

57
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,920
nature League Baseball itself

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,140
generally the way they think about it is

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,959
this you're pretty much just own the

60
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,200
card

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,659
but that's okay you see because in case

62
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,019
you don't pay attention to such things

63
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,000
rare baseball cards can be worth a lot

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,379
of money

65
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,280
and that's the point rare things can be

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,300
valuable

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,840
and nfts package up Rarity into a nice

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,080
neat blockchain ready bundle and put it

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,879
up for sale

70
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,080
remember it's right there in the name

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,959
non-fungal means unique

72
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,480
so long as an acre is trustworthy and

73
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,299
they won't make duplicate nfts you have

74
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,299
a unique artificially rare item

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,319
so rare things can be valuable

76
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,980
but not all rare things are valuable the

77
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,260
problem with nfts is they're

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,040
artificially rare rare desirable things

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,700
are valuable diamonds are rare and

80
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,738
desirable

81
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,560
remember Beanie Babies

82
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,680
at one time they were rare and desirable

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,180
desirable

84
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,900
but now not so much sure there are still

85
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,639
some that are valuable but for the most

86
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,919
part the bottom has dropped out of that

87
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,020
market

88
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,020
but if you can create an nft that

89
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,660
somehow excites the public

90
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,139
you can make a lot of money

91
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,259
but for those investing in them I would

92
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,320
caution you to use only those funds you

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,360
could potentially afford to lose

94
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,300
here's some items of interest that I

95
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,580
found out while I was studying about NF

96
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,820
teams

97
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,880
nfts generally only contain a link to

98
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,280
the actual collectible item the graphic

99
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,419
art the sound the video Etc that's

100
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,699
because storing data on the blockchain

101
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,620
itself is a fabulously expensive thing

102
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,800
at the current price of ethereum

103
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,340
storing just 500 kilobytes of data would

104
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,100
cost approximately twenty thousand

105
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,460
dollars

106
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,639
there are specifications for what data

107
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,220
should be stored within an NFC and how

108
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,979
that data should be formatted there are

109
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,199
several formats but many of the central

110
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,560
hubs for buying and selling nfts require

111
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,539
a specific format ERC 721

112
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,180
the reason they require the nft

113
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,940
information to be in that format is they

114
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,919
want to be able to display that

115
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,280
information automatically

116
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,340
here's one that I thought was very

117
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,639
interesting the most expensive board ape

118
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,180
which was number eight eight one seven

119
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,560
it sold for three million four hundred

120
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,320
eight thousand dollars

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,520
and because I'm just such a swell guy

122
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,219
you can see it here for free

123
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,319
when I was studying nfts I ended up

124
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,780
going down a rather interesting Rabbit

125
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,660
Hole I discovered something called a

126
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,060
Merkel tree

127
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,860
Miracle trees are data structures used

128
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,400
for various purposes in nft contracts

129
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,860
one reason you might use one is to

130
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,900
create a pre-sale allow list or

131
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,759
something like that

132
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,340
there are three types of nodes in a

133
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,280
Merkle tree there are Leaf nodes those

134
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
at the bottom of the tree when you're

135
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,220
looking at it inverted like this

136
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,460
they're items d e f and g in this

137
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,960
diagram

138
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,259
their value is created by using a hash

139
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,900
function on the original data that

140
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,240
you're wanting to store so for example

141
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
if you wanted to store wallet addresses

142
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,740
on the tree

143
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,940
you would store in d e f and g

144
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,780
four values for four different block

145
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,960
addresses created by hashing those block

146
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,880
addresses

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,419
then the next type of of node are parent

148
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,919
nodes

149
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,240
those are items B and C in this diagram

150
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,300
they sit between the top of the tree and

151
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,039
the bottom of the tree where the leaf

152
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,160
nodes are and depending on the number of

153
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,919
leaf nodes that you had there have there

154
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,380
may be various different amounts of

155
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,199
parent nodes various different levels of

156
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,580
parent nodes

157
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,160
the value of a parent node is determined

158
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,160
by concatenating the hashes of the nodes

159
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
below it and then just simply hashing

160
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,860
that value now order is important

161
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,680
because we typically concatenate them

162
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,580
from left to right

163
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,620
finally there's the root mode

164
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,900
this is the single node that sits up at

165
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,639
the top of the tree and its value is

166
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
created in the same way as parent nodes

167
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,520
in other words take the two values below

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,219
it concatenate them together going left

169
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,479
to right

170
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,059
and then hash that value and that's the

171
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,580
value of the root node

172
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,099
well why are we talking about all of

173
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,480
this

174
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,680
well

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,100
why Merkle trees are interesting is this

176
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,860
they're incredibly ingenious

177
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,940
because here's an interesting fact it

178
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,700
does not require any knowledge of the

179
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,300
original data blocks to verify that a

180
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,000
node belongs to our tree

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,700
all we need to know is the original

182
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,560
piece of data that we're trying to

183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,040
verify

184
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,459
and we just need to know the direct

185
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,860
neighboring Leaf node for that hash if

186
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,620
there is any and the neighboring parrot

187
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,620
node hashes directly above the leaf node

188
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,740
if we know those things we can use those

189
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,880
together with the value at the root node

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,399
to actually prove whether or not that

191
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,420
address

192
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,080
was hashed as one of those final lower

193
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,920
Leaf values this is amazingly elegant

194
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,399
and Incredibly useful I intend to do

195
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,380
some further investigation on this and

196
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,480
hopefully I'll be making some code

197
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,380
available uh somewhere on GitHub in the

198
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,500
future

199
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,820
thank you so very much for participating

200
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,500
in today's presentation on

201
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,399
nfts

202
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,100
and I hope you found that you really can

203
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,880
have fun with non-fungible tokens

204
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,539
