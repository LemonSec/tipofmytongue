2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,740
well hello there

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,719
Santa asked me to share with you the

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,160
instructions on the gift he brought to

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,299
you this year

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,480
the holiday hack challenge 2022

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,340
now I'm not going to tell you how to

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,859
solve all the problems in fact it's the

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,720
challenges themselves that can help you

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,060
in landing your first or next role in

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,920
cyber security

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,439
which is what the gift truly is

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,700
all right

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,219
so you're probably wondering who I am

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,680
and how I know Santa

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,860
well the last part's a secret but as for

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,980
who I am I'm Chris lemon I'm a security

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,559
engineer at secure Yeti where I do

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,600
assessments and Pen tests for some

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,460
pretty cool clients

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,559
I'm also an instructor and a curriculum

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,300
developer at city colleges of Chicago

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,360
where I run a CTF course and help get

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,820
non-traditional students into the cyber

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,620
security industry

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,140
I'm also a Sans diversity Academy

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,100
graduate and a dog mom which yes of

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,840
course it's relevant

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,360
especially when discussing cyber

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,900
security because look at those faces

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,220
okay

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,400
back on topic now I don't have a

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,860
traditional background I actually used

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,799
to be a professional nanny

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,259
when the pandemic hit in 2020 I was

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,259
working as a nanny so how do they make

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,360
the journey from Nanny to security

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,119
engineer

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,860
arguably the biggest thing needed to go

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,079
from being a nanny to an engineer is

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,100
knowledge

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,740
however knowledge itself isn't quite

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,640
enough

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,860
because we all know you can have the

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,880
skills

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,040
but actually getting the job takes more

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,439
than simply being capable

48
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,320
so let me break down my formula for you

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,479
into three components

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,060
learning the skills documenting the

51
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,119
skills and convincing people that you

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,159
have those skills

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,500
enter ctfs

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,720
not only are these games fun and

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,000
competitive because I do love a good

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
competition but they can also help you

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,860
tackle each of these three necessary

58
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,640
components

59
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,900
when you think of what you can gain from

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,239
ctfs you may think of technical skill

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,440
development

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,060
and you're not wrong

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,400
I remember setting up a Cali image for

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,220
my very first ETF it was incredibly

65
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,260
intimidating and it took me multiple

66
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,599
tries on multiple days before I got it

67
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,739
up and running

68
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,840
however now that's a skill that I use

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,540
daily in my job as a technical tester

70
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,879
and to tell you the truth I spent almost

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,519
my entire Monday this week fixing a

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,739
corrupted image that I needed to get a

73
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,360
file off of

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
which leads me to one of the most

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,819
critical skill sets exercised by ctfs

76
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,379
you aren't only bulking up your

77
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,599
technical skills you're also developing

78
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,180
problem-solving skills critical thinking

79
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,360
and yes Googling is a huge skill to have

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,420
as a technical tester or duck duck going

81
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,940
whatever your preferred method is for

82
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,900
searching

83
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,260
but this is a huge skill to have

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,800
in any sort of cyber security job or any

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
job I'd call it a life skill

86
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
knowing how to find the answer when you

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,860
don't know what it is

88
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,980
often crucial to getting the job done

89
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,900
and once you figure out how to solve the

90
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,220
problem

91
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,319
being able to document and know how to

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,599
reference that solution is immensely

93
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,480
important important for saving time and

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,640
not getting frustrated

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,180
as a technical tester documentation is a

96
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,680
large part of the job

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,780
clients don't care about your testing

98
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,299
they care about what your findings are

99
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,220
and if you can't show them what you

100
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,519
found they'll likely find the door on

101
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,560
the way out of that contract

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,180
so

103
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,459
learning how to effectively organize and

104
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,099
store your notes is a greatly important

105
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,379
skill and it'll help you as you continue

106
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,799
in your ctfs as well

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,599
personally my favorite tool for

108
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,299
documentation is OneNote you can search

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,660
across multiple Pages across books it's

110
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,459
easy to access and you can share it

111
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,120
across multiple devices seamlessly

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,940
figure out what works best for you but

113
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,040
no taking an organization will be really

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,540
helpful in helping you develop

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,880
documentation to Showcase your new

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,919
skills

117
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,740
all right so you're gaining some skills

118
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,479
however Pixar it didn't happen or

119
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,979
documentation or it didn't happen

120
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,080
documentation is the first step in

121
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,639
communicating what your skills are

122
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,940
because let's face it there are a lot of

123
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,440
people out there who claim to have

124
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,680
skills that end up being Duds people

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,580
often over embellish don't do that but

126
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,680
show people what your skills are

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,199
so now's your chance to Showcase your

128
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,660
true skills

129
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,580
now there are a couple of previous

130
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,699
holiday hack write-up examples on here

131
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,259
on this slide

132
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,660
use them as something to strive for but

133
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,060
don't be intimidated by them they are

134
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,160
after all a couple of the winners of the

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,540
competitions

136
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,259
and they are very impressive

137
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,240
of course quite possibly the most

138
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,419
important piece of documentation is your

139
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,320
resume

140
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,440
however when adding ctfs to your resume

141
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,259
don't just add the CTF include skills

142
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,180
that you learned if you're really

143
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,820
lacking solid experience to put on your

144
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,280
resume you can add bullets to add

145
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,699
additional content for example solved 24

146
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,060
out of 28 available problems and

147
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,680
finished in the top 10 percent of

148
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,600
contestants

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,580
you can also add bullets that highlight

150
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,620
some of the tools and Concepts you've

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,840
utilized during the competition

152
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,180
Additionally you can add multiple years

153
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,460
of ctfs to show your improvement from

154
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,020
year to year

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,360
don't forget you've honed more than just

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,699
technical skills include soft skills

157
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,500
like problem solving and documentation

158
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,960
and potentially report writing within

159
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,400
your resume

160
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,160
now while write-ups may be helpful for

161
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
your own skill development

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,759
in order to fully take advantage of this

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,660
gift you'll need to share it with others

164
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,479
that's where networking comes in

165
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,340
let's go back for a minute to where I

166
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,680
said I went from being a nanny to a

167
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,419
security engineer

168
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,520
one of the biggest components that got

169
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,860
me here was my personal Network

170
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,720
when I landed my first job in the

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,600
industry I did it through networking

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,780
also my second and my third job as well

173
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,240
and I'm going to tell you a secret

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm as introverted as they come yet here

175
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,960
I am speaking to all of you

176
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,400
why

177
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,419
because Chris LG asked me to because

178
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:05,280
networking shout out to Chris by the way

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,740
if you don't know Chris he is one of the

180
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,199
amazing holiday hack developers Chris

181
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,139
you are awesome and thanks so much for

182
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,840
such an amazing and fun CTF

183
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,039
okay

184
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
back on topic

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,500
so ctfs are a great way to grow your

186
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,720
network and connect with others and

187
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,240
guess what when you work with others you

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,539
gain another skill collaboration

189
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,880
which is a pretty huge skill when it

190
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,699
comes to working on a team

191
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,340
honestly many technical testers are lone

192
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,979
wolves so if you work well on a team

193
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,720
that's a skill that employers would love

194
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,740
to see

195
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,560
so if you haven't already make sure to

196
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
join the holiday hack Discord Channel

197
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,660
and get involved you never know who you

198
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,220
may be talking to and how you can help

199
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,099
each other and if not now maybe in the

200
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,539
future

201
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,819
also sharing your progress on social

202
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,919
media is a great way to get on people's

203
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
radar

204
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,020
with the CTF course I facilitate one of

205
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,880
the largest benefits of the course is

206
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,380
the networking space that is available

207
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,240
to the students

208
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,380
consider joining a CTF club or a Meetup

209
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,599
I attend a monthly hacker Meetup and the

210
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,039
connections I have made there are

211
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,900
invaluable

212
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,000
if there isn't anything in your area you

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,520
can always start something which would

214
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
yet be another thing to add to your

215
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,900
already impressive resume

216
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,539
or you can focus on networking online

217
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,760
either way sharing what you've learned

218
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,799
is definitely the icing on the cake when

219
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,979
it comes to the power of ctfs

220
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,159
all right well that's it for Santa's

221
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,680
instructions learn the skills document

222
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,720
the skills and go out there and convince

223
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
people you have the skills so

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,100
whether you're looking to land your

225
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,380
first role in cyber security or you're

226
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,740
looking to move on to your next remember

227
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,360
fun and technical skills aren't all you

228
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,940
gain from ctfs Earnest the full power of

229
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,220
what ctfs have to offer

230
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,019
hopefully you all have a wonderful

231
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,360
holiday season and hope to see you all

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,940
around the virtual North Pole happy

233
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,480
hacking

234
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:23,049
