2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,960
thank you

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,480
hello and welcome to my crinklecon talk

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,480
a curmudgeon looks at cryptocurrencies

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,359
my name is Tom Liston I'm the curmudgeon

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,220
in Residence at counterhack

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,740
let's get something out of the way right

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,380
up front

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,740
there's a really really bothersome

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,680
Trend going on right now in the

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,480
cryptocurrency community and that is

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,739
they're calling cryptocurrencies crypto

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,879
stop it we were using crypto for

14
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,739
cryptography before most of the crypto

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,899
Bros were born

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,680
stop calling it crypto

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,199
see if you can work out all of the

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,760
strength required to say cryptocurrency

19
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,120
like I said I'm the curmudgeon get off

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,719
my lawn

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
now that that's out of the way we can

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,960
move on to some other things

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,820
what is a cryptocurrency well a

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,100
cryptocurrency is just a digital

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,439
currency which can act as an alternative

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,240
form of payment

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,000
and it's created by using encryption

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,979
algorithms

29
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,200
and the use of encryption Technologies

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,580
and especially the fact that these

31
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,960
transactions are stored the the

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,180
cryptocurrency transactions are stored

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,640
on a blockchain means that

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
cryptocurrencies function both as a

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,079
currency something you can use to buy

36
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,000
something and also as a virtual

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,079
accounting system or a ledger system

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,479
as I said cryptocurrencies use something

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,340
called A blockchain and A blockchain is

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,460
simply a linked list of data where each

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,340
node holds a cryptographically sound

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,420
hash of the node that came before it and

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,219
the node before it

44
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,340
holds a cryptographically sound hash of

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,440
the node that came before it and the

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,720
node that became before that one holds a

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,420
cryptographically sound hash of the node

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,400
before that one so you can if you think

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,560
about what this means

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,680
every time you add a new block

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,860
to the blockchain

52
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,620
it's proving the validity of the block

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,160
before it and the one before that and

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
the one before that and the one before

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,080
that because each block proves the

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,760
validity of the block before it

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,720
therefore you can't change anything once

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,599
it's put on to the Block Chain

59
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,400
and that is how uh

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,560
cryptocurrencies have this virtual

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
accounting system or Ledger system in

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,739
that once a transaction is placed on the

63
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,080
blockchain it's immutable it can't be

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
taken off of the blockchain without

65
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,060
someone at least knowing that someone

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,400
has done something to the blockchain

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,480
uh because it will invalidate the hashes

68
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,819
of uh the blocks that follow it

69
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,900
an important thing to remember here when

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,400
we're talking about blockchain and

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
cryptocurrency a lot of people tend to

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,319
use those two terms interchangeably but

73
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,260
blockchain and cryptocurrency are not

74
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,720
the same thing cryptocurrencies use

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,420
blockchains but blockchains have many

76
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,200
other uses

77
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,879
now there are multiple flavors of

78
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,860
cryptocurrencies out there various

79
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,540
different kinds of either they're called

80
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,299
crypto coins or tokens uh the most

81
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,760
famous one being Bitcoin followed

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,000
probably uh by ethereum uh then there's

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,680
tether USD coin BNB binance USD xrp

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,959
which used to be called Ripple Litecoin

85
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,379
Dogecoin coins coins coins tokens tokens

86
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,620
tokens the fact that there are so many

87
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,080
different kinds of cryptocurrency or

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,340
crypto tokens uh becomes a problem and

89
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,980
we'll talk about why that is later on by

90
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,918
fracturing this Marketplace uh this has

91
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,040
caused an enormous amount of volatility

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,180
in the marketplace

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
from a North Pole perspective we want to

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,460
talk about ethereum now ethereum is the

95
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,520
name of a decentralized open source

96
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,919
blockchain that has something called

97
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,520
smart contract functionality now ether

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,180
is the native cryptocurrency found on

99
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,040
the ethereum blockchain but more

100
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,800
interesting than ether is this whole

101
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,660
idea about smart contracts uh the

102
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,900
ability to write smart contracts

103
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,960
so what this means is using a smart

104
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,120
contract you can create programs that

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,680
perform specific Financial tasks

106
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,600
automatically or autonomously

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,320
based on market conditions they can

108
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
perform trades they can do lots of

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
various things and as an example you can

110
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,780
create an entire cryptocurrency uh

111
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,600
by writing a smart contract that runs on

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,699
the ethereum blockchain so that your

113
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,860
cryptocurrency will use the ethereum

114
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,900
blockchain as well

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,539
if you've been you know

116
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,340
playing around at the North Pole

117
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,979
wandering around at the North Pole uh

118
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,199
you will have noticed that the North

119
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,860
Pole has its very own brand new

120
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,539
cryptocurrency just this year called

121
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,820
kringlecoin

122
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,979
uh this is an example of a a smart token

123
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,259
uh created using a smart contract

124
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,660
written in a programming language called

125
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,500
solidity uh it's designed to meet a

126
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,620
standard known as erc20 ERC stands for

127
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,979
uh ethereum request for comment uh sort

128
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,759
of akin to the whole internet RFC kind

129
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,900
of idea and in order to be an erc20

130
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,380
compliant token uh the token needs to

131
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,680
support various different functions so

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,380
that it can be uh traded back and forth

133
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,000
uh with other erc20 compliant uh tokens

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,160
so you can actually

135
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,580
um have some sort of conversion between

136
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,919
the two of those or you can use one

137
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,039
erc20 token to purchase an other uh

138
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,759
erc20 token and the kringlecoin smart

139
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,720
contract is written to be mostly erc20

140
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,620
compliant

141
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,080
so let's take a step back for a minute

142
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,360
as we you know continue our discussion

143
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,280
about cryptocurrencies and let's let's

144
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
talk about what is a currency

145
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
so

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,819
at this very most basic level a currency

147
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,000
is any item that can be used as a medium

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,699
medium of exchange and what do we mean

149
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,780
by that well we mean an item has to be

150
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,099
considered

151
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,000
uh to have a widely accepted and agreed

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,639
upon level of value

153
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,919
meaning that

154
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,660
uh three beads will get me

155
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,300
um I don't know a a cow or uh six beads

156
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,580
will get me a house or or whatever it

157
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,400
might be we but there has to be a widely

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,520
accepted and agreed-upon level of value

159
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,060
so over time people have used lots of

160
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,120
different things uh as currency probably

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,860
the the ones that everyone is most

162
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,039
familiar with gold and silver but gems

163
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,500
have been used as currency beads have

164
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,440
been used as currency fur salt whale

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,099
teeth bricks of tea and even wheels of

166
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,620
Parmesan cheese have been used as

167
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,500
currency at points in time in the past

168
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,440
now as people have evolved we've moved

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,000
away from using

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,440
um large and and perishable items or

171
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,979
incredibly expensive or incredibly rare

172
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,039
items and we've moved on to uh

173
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,059
standardized metal coins or paper money

174
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,779
and and even today uh most of the

175
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,820
financial transactions are bits stored

176
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,159
on hard drives or in memory so where

177
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
does a cryptocurrency fit into all this

178
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,600
well a cryptocurrency is different from

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
all of that in that cryptocurrencies

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,420
live on and are

181
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,440
um kept track of on blockchains

182
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,660
so the question becomes

183
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,740
are cryptocurrencies going to be the

184
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,640
reigning currency in the future

185
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
well

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
I'm about to disappoint a bunch of

187
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,860
crypto Bros because I'm going to say no

188
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,700
or at least not in the near future the

189
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,880
potential is there possibly but not in

190
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,700
the near future why well

191
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,600
there are lots and lots of problems with

192
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,260
cryptocurrencies as currencies so let's

193
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,500
let's talk about a few of those

194
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,380
so one of the biggest problems with

195
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,880
cryptocurrencies

196
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,120
is is involved in this whole idea of the

197
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,140
the cryptocurrencies being designed as

198
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,300
software essentially

199
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,220
and the problem is

200
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,820
most of the folks who are writing the

201
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,220
salinity code or the various different

202
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,120
kinds of codes surrounding exchanges and

203
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,660
crypto coins are not the Rock Solid

204
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,839
programmers that they think they are

205
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,700
for example a whopping 14 billion

206
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,980
dollars of cryptocurrencies were

207
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,420
reported stolen in 2021 most

208
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,480
of those thefts were due to errors in

209
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,279
programming

210
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,440
the other problem is people aren't

211
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,540
nearly as security conscious as they

212
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,920
think they are

213
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,959
so nfts are are non-fungal tokens now uh

214
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,300
cryptocurrencies are fungible meaning

215
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,060
they can be broken up and and used part

216
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,800
of them can be used to pay for one thing

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,360
part of them can be used to pay for

218
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,940
another thing if I have 10 crypto coins

219
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,120
I can use a half of a crypto coin to

220
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,220
purchase something over here and half of

221
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,959
a crypto coin over there I can break

222
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,839
them up nfts are essentially like

223
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,940
crypto tokens but they're non-fungal

224
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,980
they can't be broken up they are one

225
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,579
thing and they stay one thing forever

226
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,420
um over 100 million dollars worth of

227
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,680
nfts were publicly reported as stolen

228
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,760
uh through scams between July of 2021

229
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,760
and July of 2022.

230
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,420
now both of these things the 14 billion

231
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,240
dollars of cryptocurrencies stolen and

232
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,279
the 100 million dollars worth of nfts

233
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,440
are only those thefts that are reported

234
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,279
and as we all know

235
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,500
crimes like this are often underreported

236
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,899
because people are either embarrassed

237
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:50,660
or they have some sort of uh Financial

238
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,720
uh security issue in reporting that they

239
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,100
have lost

240
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,600
uh

241
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
hundreds of thousands of dollars perhaps

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,180
millions of dollars and so these crimes

243
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,560
go under reported

244
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,320
the other problem or one of the other

245
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,079
problems with with the cryptocurrency

246
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,720
industry is it's not really a mature

247
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,260
industry uh regulation has yet to catch

248
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,240
up with cryptocurrency Market

249
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,200
uh it is essentially the Wild Wild West

250
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,620
there are so many scammers out there so

251
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,560
much money lost uh there are so many

252
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,720
scams and so much money being lost that

253
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,820
there's an entire new vocabulary being

254
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,260
created just to uh describe the things

255
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,180
that are happening happening out there

256
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,200
uh for example the the term rug pull is

257
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,620
uh is is a is a description of a

258
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,920
specific kind of scam uh and so you know

259
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,300
when when you're talking about a market

260
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,820
in which new vocabulary needs to be

261
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,760
created in order to describe the scams

262
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,860
that are going on you know that's not

263
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,160
really a mature industry recently uh

264
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,899
we've all heard about the collapse of

265
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,500
FTX and that uncovered a huge number of

266
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,200
shady strategies and failed corporate

267
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,579
controls there was just no regulation

268
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,040
going on in this organization whatsoever

269
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,940
they ended up with at the latest count

270
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,100
nine billion dollars in liabilities

271
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,519
and 800 million dollars in assets and

272
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,880
and in an article where I was reading

273
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,320
about this uh one sentence kind of stuck

274
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,079
out uh they set a substantial number of

275
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,320
assets may be missing or stolen which

276
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,540
means that nobody was paying attention

277
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,540
there were no controls over what this

278
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,959
organization was doing people will not

279
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,899
use a system that is viewed as being

280
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,540
substantially corrupt they're not going

281
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,459
to be putting their money into something

282
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,660
like this

283
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,920
the other problem uh I would term the

284
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,200
the the the mom and dad or Grandma and

285
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Grandpa problem

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,100
as you're going to find out if you

287
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,260
haven't already when you use kringlecoin

288
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,380
it's a little difficult to use you have

289
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,740
to remember your keys you have to

290
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,180
remember uh your wallet ID uh it really

291
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,540
isn't an intuitive thing to to do uh

292
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,760
it's just it's difficult it's confusing

293
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,700
it's not how we're used to spending

294
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,660
money uh there are of course

295
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,339
user-friendly wallets that exist just

296
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,980
none of them are at the North Pole and

297
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,740
the problem is I really believe they're

298
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,240
still likely beyond the technical

299
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,800
capability of average folks my kind of

300
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,100
uh measuring stick for all of this is if

301
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,079
your parents or grandparents if you

302
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,839
think they couldn't use it it's not

303
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,660
going to be widely used technology

304
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,260
the other problem remember when we

305
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,139
talked about all that stuff that they

306
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,139
used to use as currencies remember we

307
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,600
said that there needed to be an agreed

308
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,160
upon value

309
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,500
well unfortunately the cryptocurrence

310
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,860
market Marketplace is so fractured with

311
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,480
all of these various different kinds of

312
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,199
coins and tokens and trying to get one

313
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,260
to be able to be traded into another and

314
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,160
there's just so much volatility that it

315
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,959
just isn't currently capable of being

316
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,720
used for day-to-day purchases if the

317
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,720
price swings are so huge

318
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,240
um nobody wants to put their their their

319
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,240
their their their cash into a

320
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,180
cryptocurrency where the value might be

321
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,600
wiped out or half wiped out or overnight

322
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,760
it's like what if what if your wheel of

323
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,040
Parmesan cheese was worth five cows

324
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
today but only worth one cow next week

325
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,560
your parmesan cheese starts to look like

326
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,740
a really bad currency and you might just

327
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,959
be you know trying to get out of the

328
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,339
parmesan cheese market

329
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,860
what the cryptocurrency market is

330
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,040
missing right now is really apparent

331
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,220
it's Santa

332
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,760
if Santa were to back a cryptocurrency

333
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,839
well he's trustworthy he will not scam

334
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,019
you Santa Claus wouldn't scam anyone he

335
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,779
doesn't need regulation because he's

336
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,820
