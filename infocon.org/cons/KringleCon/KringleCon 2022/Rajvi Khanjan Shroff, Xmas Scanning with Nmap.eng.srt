2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,720
thank you

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,500
hi everyone welcome to kringlecon my

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,960
name is rajui cranjan Shroff and I'm

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,260
excited to be talking about nmap all

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,760
right let's get started

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,940
to start off a little bit about me you

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,739
might already know me from some of my

9
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,500
other science events I keynoted at the

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,960
Sam's pentas hack Fest Summit I've

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
presented at the science Nisha Cyrus

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,219
Summit as well as the science cyber

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,040
count for teens I've also been a speaker

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,500
at the Linux foundation's open source

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,079
Summit along with speaking at various

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,120
events I'm also the founder of project

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,539
cyber we are an organization for teens

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,960
by teens interested in cyber security

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,319
we create content on cyber security such

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,380
as articles on various topics and we

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,720
have cyber security related events and

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,479
opportunities for teens to participate

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,200
in

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,860
I've listed the URLs for the website and

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,979
the YouTube right here so feel free to

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,020
check us out and learn more about what

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,200
we do a quick note we would love to

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,659
welcome more cyber Security

29
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,159
Professionals helping

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,799
um out with project cyber so if we'd

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,979
like to help us out please contact me at

32
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,180
rks Mission possible at their gmail.com

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,600
this email is also listed on the project

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,960
cyber website and at the end of the

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,759
slides

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,820
in addition I've also placed nationally

37
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,119
at two cyber security competitions and

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,340
recently I was a summer camp instructor

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,220
and taught cyber security Concepts to

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,619
students my age along with adult

41
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,219
teachers and most of all I'm a High

42
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,320
School junior who's passionate about

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,038
cyber security

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,780
okay cool now let's get into the agenda

45
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,300
for the day I've split the presentation

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,540
into a few chapters so the sections will

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,840
be covering are an introduction to nlab

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,260
so so if you're already acquainted with

49
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,540
the basics it can serve as a quick

50
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,239
refresher and if you're new it will

51
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,760
cover everything you need to know

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
the common syntax you need to be

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,620
acquainted with and also the types of

54
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,379
scans we will then go into scripting

55
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,379
with nmap and then finish off with the

56
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,540
resource as a tip if you want to do more

57
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,220
research

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,620
since you're doing it during Christmas I

59
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,080
thought to name this talk Xmas scanning

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,379
as a play on words so just to clarify we

61
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,560
won't be focusing on eczema scans only

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,180
but all offend Maps

63
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,019
nmap is a network mapper and it's used

64
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,420
to gather information for reconnaissance

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,659
and enumeration it can do this by

66
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,599
scanning posts and services the nice

67
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,580
thing about it is that it's very well

68
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,700
documented and easy to use and it's also

69
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,480
available on Linux Mac and windows nmap

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,099
is actually one of the most popular

71
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,159
network discovery tools out there and

72
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,220
fun fact along with a strong presence in

73
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,920
Academia and research it also has a

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
strong presence in popular culture as

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,840
well so it's something that has a broad

76
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,879
appeal which is pretty cool

77
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,599
the mechanism behind how and Map works

78
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,540
is that it sends packets to hosts and

79
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,140
networks and these will respond back and

80
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,360
these responses are actually what can

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,299
help us but figuring out what posts are

82
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,580
vulnerable in a network the kind of

83
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,799
vulnerability it possesses

84
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,620
there's also this idea of Port states

85
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,799
that the nmap can report back on there's

86
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,160
an open closed filtered unfiltered and

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,978
so on which we will go in depth about a

88
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,380
little bit later

89
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,660
nmap can also tell you the OS version

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,479
history and so much more it has a lot

91
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,380
more functionality

92
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,160
to work one of the things nmap relies on

93
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,000
are TCP and UDP protocols here's a

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,340
diagram from the official website of

95
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,639
nlab about how a scan might work

96
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,940
let's take an example a send scan which

97
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,020
is a kind of skin scan that nmap can do

98
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,259
and how it uses an incomplete three-way

99
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,979
handshake first we have a request sent

100
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,580
to the Target machine uh since fans were

101
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,160
synchronized and the scan me in this

102
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,160
case will respond back with a synack

103
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,740
which is a syn acknowledgment which is

104
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,080
almost like a thumbs up message

105
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,400
now because we're doing a since skin

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,740
scan we're not actually finishing up

107
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,580
with the TCP protocol so nmap responds

108
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,120
back with rst which stands for reset

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
which is kind of like it's cutting off

110
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
the conversation so whenever we run a

111
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,060
command using an nmap

112
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,460
using nmap this is behind the scenes

113
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,859
action that nmap does for us

114
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,680
it's also useful to know that there's an

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,800
nmap Suite which actually contains a lot

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,039
of interesting utilities too there's Zen

117
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,039
map which is a GUI turn Map There's also

118
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,340
what the nmap creators call a model view

119
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,600
implementation of netcat or ncat

120
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,840
we also have endif and and ping

121
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
all right let me now turn on my laser

122
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,440
pointer so I can kind of Point things

123
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,060
out here

124
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,639
okay now let's cover how to interpret

125
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,060
the results and map gives us every scan

126
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,000
is of course slightly different but it

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,280
should look look similar to The

128
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,638
Following

129
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,680
first I'll tell you the time and map has

130
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,300
started and it reminds you for what site

131
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,419
or domain or Target you're running an

132
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,380
nmap stand for it then tells you if this

133
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,699
host is up and if if the host is up it

134
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,460
will tell you the latency which you can

135
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,460
think of as the time it took in this

136
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,500
case the time it took for checking the

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,780
host is up

138
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,960
um now when nmap runs a scan there's

139
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,819
bound to be a few unfiltered ports

140
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,000
um like that are not shown and all it

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,300
means is that

142
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,360
um it can be classified we'll talk about

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,960
it more uh later in the presentation but

144
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,539
this is uh

145
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,080
this is what uh nmap tries to let you

146
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,520
know right over here

147
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,060
um and then we have something that's

148
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,060
known as a port table right over here

149
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,539
this whole section that says Port State

150
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,960
service

151
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,039
um

152
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,880
so

153
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,780
it then closes out with telling us how

154
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,139
long the entire and Maps can took and

155
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,419
this is pretty helpful if you are a

156
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,599
network admin or pen tester or even if

157
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,099
you just want to know what's on your

158
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,199
home network

159
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,539
um now notice under the state right over

160
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:08,580
here it has um all uh saying open but

161
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,099
there's more possibilities that nmap can

162
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,460
tell you

163
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,620
so now let's cover what port states are

164
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,599
open means that an application on the

165
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,879
target machine is listening for

166
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,720
connections or packets on that Port when

167
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,080
nmap says that a port is closed it means

168
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,440
that there is no application

169
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,179
listening as of the moment you ran the

170
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,820
scan but it's important to know that it

171
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,339
could open up anytime there's also

172
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,760
filtered and unfiltered

173
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,740
um and the key difference between the

174
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,560
two is that with filtered

175
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,660
um those ports have not responded to

176
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,600
nmap so nmap simply doesn't know which

177
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,260
of the two states it's in but unfiltered

178
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,380
means that it was responsive to nmap but

179
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,500
it's hard for a map to classify if it's

180
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,080
open or closed

181
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,100
another key the idea is that filtered

182
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,260
means that some kind of filter or

183
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,620
obstacle such as a firewall is blocking

184
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,360
the port

185
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,019
um there's also these State combinations

186
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,959
open filtered and closed filtered when

187
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,940
it's kind of in the middle of being

188
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,200
either of those two

189
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,740
another key thing to note is the base

190
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,940
syntax which goes like this and map scan

191
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,720
type options then Target like the target

192
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,480
specification

193
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,880
um note that you can pass in a lot of

194
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,740
different things for their target here

195
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,279
such as the IP address range

196
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,000
um things like that

197
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,180
I also have some examples of syntax here

198
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,459
first is if you want to scan a website

199
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:14,399
using its URL it'll be nmap Dash capital

200
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,019
P lowercase n exampleurl.com

201
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,019
um you can also substitute in the IP

202
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,080
address in place of the URL if you want

203
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,279
to do a scan that way

204
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,779
um on the other hand if you want to scan

205
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,339
a specific Port you can do nmap Dash p

206
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,620
then the port number and then finally

207
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,080
the IP address

208
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,240
um and then to check if report is open

209
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,519
you can do nmap dash s uh capital S and

210
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,040
then the IP address

211
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,920
this should help in getting a sense of

212
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,680
how a map works and what the commands

213
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,240
tend to look like

214
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,540
foreign

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,660
all right now let's get into the demos

216
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,920
um I'll be demoing using

217
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,600
scanme.nmap.org which is actually a nice

218
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,060
feature that's offered by nmap

219
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,720
themselves so let me open it up here for

220
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
us so this is what it um it looks like

221
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,640
now let's go back here and let me open

222
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,019
up the command prompt

223
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,839
okay here we go I've also made the font

224
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,000
size bigger so you guys should be able

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,180
to see it first thing I'll do is type

226
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,540
nmap dash dash health

227
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,720
so we have the

228
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,940
um help page pulled up for us

229
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,959
um here we can just see how many options

230
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,660
there are available so there's the

231
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,140
target specification that we can hear do

232
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,660
here so it kind of details more on that

233
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,320
there's host Discovery scan techniques

234
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,160
Port specification and then also a scan

235
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,660
order

236
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,320
um because actually it uh nmap by

237
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,339
default isn't going to scan all reports

238
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,079
um and then service slash version

239
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,560
detection script scan OS detection

240
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,440
timing and performance

241
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,880
um lots of lots of options in here

242
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,200
um

243
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,100
so right here are some example commands

244
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,459
you can run as well the first demo I'll

245
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,920
do is nmap Dash ask S

246
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,600
um

247
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,920
scan me Dot nmap.org

248
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,240
and so here uh you can see that

249
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,060
it has a format similar to what we had

250
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,279
earlier

251
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,060
um

252
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,899
so this is a pretty quick scan but for

253
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,620
longer scans one useful tip is to press

254
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,040
any key on your keyboard such as up

255
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,980
Arrow or even the enter key to get

256
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,700
information on the status so

257
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,240
um let's try this again and let's see if

258
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,660
it takes a bit longer yeah see so I just

259
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,540
pressed enter a couple of times right

260
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,540
then and it gave me some stats so it

261
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,899
told me the time elapsed then how many

262
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,180
hosts have completed

263
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,980
um and so on

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,980
um so that's a nice way to know what's

265
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,380
going on like what percent is completed

266
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,880
things like that like right here 1.4

267
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,200
8.0 8.60 20.30

268
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,279
[Music]

269
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,000
um

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,880
which is pretty cool another quick tip

271
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,380
is if I again repeat the same scan but

272
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,639
if I add a dash V parameter in here

273
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,300
um what it will do is it will change the

274
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,720
verbosity so the dash v stands for

275
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,420
verbosity level and verbosity

276
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,260
essentially controls how much output and

277
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,440
map will give out so basically how much

278
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,800
information we can see about what nmap

279
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,540
is doing while it completes the scan

280
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,440
so I can do Dash weaving for double

281
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,579
um

282
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,139
so

283
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,420
we can see here it's giving us a lot of

284
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,000
information like whenever it discovers

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,060
an open port it will tell us that and

286
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,220
then it'll tell us a whole lot more

287
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,000
information than it did earlier

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
um right over here when it when we did

289
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
it with the normal command

290
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,899
without the dash we double we

291
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,880
okay so now let's go back to the sides

292
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,839
now I want to cover scan types and

293
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,060
there's a lot of scans but the two

294
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,480
fundamentals are connect scan and synth

295
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,320
scan

296
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
so connect scan doesn't require root

297
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,260
privileges so if you don't have group

298
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,160
privileges this is a scam you can do

299
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,980
however it's a very basic scan and it's

300
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,860
quite obvious so

301
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,100
um when you run it it will most likely

302
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,180
be flat by many firewalls and IDs

303
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,380
um

304
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,800
and the thing is

305
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,959
that there's

306
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,120
a better alternative which is actually

307
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,420
why I put an X out here because a much

308
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,639
better alternative is a sin scan

309
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,720
um so going back to how a syn scan Works

310
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,940
um the slide where we covered that you

311
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,220
can see how this is a modified TCP

312
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,639
protocol in a way and actually the

313
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,339
reason why a skin since scan is so much

314
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,220
more powerful than a regular TCP connect

315
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,519
scan is because of this because in a

316
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,740
connect scan there's actually a

317
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,139
connection made with the other side

318
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,440
whereas here we can see that we stop

319
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,380
right over here before actually making

320
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,600
the connection so it's more stealthy

321
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,639
so since since scan

322
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,180
um also called a half open scan is

323
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,860
something that requires through

324
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,040
privileges but is faster and stealthier

325
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,380
so if you have that kind of access then

326
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,959
it's much better to do a send scan

327
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,000
okay finally a cool app side is about

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,240
Eczema scans Xmas scans are actually a

329
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,819
kind of scan attack and they're named

330
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,540
that because they turn on a set of flags

331
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,900
within a packet so right over here we

332
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,099
can see that

333
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,460
um because uh these flags

334
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,679
um within a packet when they're turned

335
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,260
on this kind of manipulates the TCP

336
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,200
header and when we view an xmascan in

337
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,580
Wireshark

338
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,740
um such as this visual right over here

339
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,620
you can see that alternating bits are

340
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,559
enabled and then it kind of looks like

341
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,200
it's blinking in a way

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,240
um kind of like how we would light up a

343
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,059
Christmas tree so it's a cool little

344
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,520
metaphor

345
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,400
um and that's why it's apply named

346
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,179
um another neat feature of nmap is that

347
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,880
it has something known as a scripting

348
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,179
engine built in which helps to automate

349
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,919
networking tests

350
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,320
it can help with activities mentioned

351
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,039
here like network discovery

352
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,400
vulnerability detection things like that

353
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,860
now this is a bit more on the advanced

354
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,080
side than what we'll cover in this quick

355
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,140
presentation so if you want to check out

356
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,240
the list of coolscripts that you can use

357
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,260
you can go to the link mentioned here

358
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,120
um

359
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,500
and finally

360
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,260
um nice little tidbit to know about is

361
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,620
the nmap man page online and it's an

362
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,080
in-depth manual guide and it has

363
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,419
everything you would want to know from

364
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,419
the foundations to advanced concepts and

365
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,820
I found it really helpful while I was

366
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,679
learning about nmap

367
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,460
um

368
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,340
so I highly recommend it

369
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,260
um if you want to go more in depth and

370
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,900
check out the documentation which can be

371
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,299
found there

372
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,480
all right so there you have it I hope

373
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
you had a lot of fun in this

374
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,179
presentation thanks for listening

375
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,419
um and happy hacking thank you bye

376
