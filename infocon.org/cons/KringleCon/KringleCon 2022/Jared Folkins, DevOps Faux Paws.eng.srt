glad you're here now our next guest he's

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,920
a last minute villain but excellent

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,320
nonetheless and while I don't know him

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,659
personally I heard great things please

28
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,360
give a warm welcome to

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,080
elf hello

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,479
uh yeah hiya I'm sorry you're a you're a

31
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,640
dwarf

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,360
oh yeah dwarves are the best you see

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,400
yeah I think there's some kind of

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,540
mistake I I asked Lynn to find an elf to

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,040
discuss this with

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,180
yes I am elf the dwarf and I am at your

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,259
service

38
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,560
so you're a dwarf named elf

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,780
that's correct

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,280
yeah

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,380
um why don't we start with this first

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,880
slide here in our first topic

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,280
okay yeah information leaks man that is

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
quite a problem see I recall a time

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,660
where a government agency tried to

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,140
redact a sensitive document by using the

47
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,840
redact feature of some very expensive

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
software to draw black rectangles over

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,940
top of the sensitive text

50
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,819
but unfortunately these rectangles were

51
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,160
just thin layers over top of the

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,500
document and they failed to overwrite

53
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,080
the underlying metadata which still

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,400
contained all the sensitive information

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
yes sadly the sound's about right

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
for my children I recall a time where

57
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,500
someone on our team committed some

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,379
incredibly sensitive passwords into one

59
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,260
of our git repos this developer then

60
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,180
went and deleted the file in the

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,720
repository but unfortunately failed to

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
clean out the previous commits on our

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
local branch I know as they left the

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,879
sensitive passwords there

65
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,940
over a year later their laptop was

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,659
stolen by nefarious thieves and somebody

67
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,519
was able to dig through this git

68
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,400
repository and extract the passwords

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,739
which were then utilized in what would

70
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,739
end up being a significant and most

71
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,459
expensive breach let me tell you that

72
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,519
was quite the faux pas did someone say

73
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,879
Four Paws that reminds me of when me and

74
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,480
my fellow dwarfs fought off 605 pod lava

75
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,540
Bears let me tell you it was quite a

76
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,720
feat now normally we have easily fended

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,299
off an attack from four pod lava bears

78
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,260
but nay this fifth power variation was

79
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,840
something else this extra paw would

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,060
seemingly come out to nowhere and like

81
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,239
attack diagonally and stuff it made for

82
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,760
quite a battle and yet we won the day

83
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,099
and received much Glory

84
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,199
[Music]

85
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,600
as in a mistake

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,940
and what is that sound by the way doors

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,699
don't make mistakes and this it's my

88
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,220
theme music

89
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,620
dude please we are in the middle of a

90
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,680
panel can you shut that music off oh

91
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
yeah sure you betcha

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,460
next slide please

93
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,440
ah now this is a good one

94
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,960
misconfigurations I could tell one of a

95
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,660
thousand stories of my passwords or

96
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,120
firewalls allowing Ingress to private

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,060
networks but what I'd like to share is a

98
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,040
time I was testing a web application

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,300
this was an spa and was used for complex

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,120
mathematical document creation

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,940
it used a Docker container to compose

102
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,580
the documents and I discovered something

103
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,820
quite by accident when utilizing the

104
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
misconfiguration of a privileged latte

105
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,580
command it allowed me to gain remote

106
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,419
shell access to the container itself and

107
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,720
issuing an ancient incantation one of

108
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,419
deep magic created before the dawn of

109
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,080
time I busted out of the container into

110
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,259
the underlying host and I was off

111
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,440
and this story articulates a saying we

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,360
have in tcpip Wizard school it's Turtles

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,080
all the way down did someone say turtles

114
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,259
that reminds me of when me and my dad by

115
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,840
ourselves fought off 1 000 Goblin

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,120
Turtles they were Giant and slow

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,039
creatures but for not to be

118
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,620
underestimated for should one set their

119
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,259
sight on you their neck was wicked fast

120
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,900
it like shoot their head out in their

121
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,539
mouth would bite at you and stuff it

122
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,000
took three days and three nights with

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
just me and my father but in the end we

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,940
defeated every last one and we brought

125
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,460
the spoils back to our town and my

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,860
father cooked up a Mean Soup and he

127
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,039
shared it with everyone it was Turtles

128
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,979
all the way down right in our bellies

129
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,840
and our fellow Jaws shared our name and

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,060
saying our Glory

131
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,479
oh please come on the music oh yeah

132
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,880
right sorry about that bud

133
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,860
yeah can I get the final slide please

134
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,100
now this is interesting continuous

135
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,020
integration and continuous deployment

136
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,240
now that's something many companies have

137
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,340
been using for a while now you see

138
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,259
generally when a developer creates a new

139
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,900
feature instead of manually testing and

140
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,639
deploying the software there is

141
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,860
infrastructure that is utilized which

142
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,800
automatically builds runs the test and

143
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,979
then deploys it to a production instance

144
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,800
an interesting story was when CI and CD

145
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,380
was first becoming prominent vendors

146
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,080
used to give it away for free that is

147
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,780
until the Bitcoin miners showed up did

148
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,020
someone say miners that reminds me of it

149
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:31,020
no no elf stop just stop

150
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,660
be already

151
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,120
seriously you gotta stop

152
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,199
all I said was Bitcoin miners

153
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,780
wait

154
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,500
elf would you ever consider helping a

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,380
fellow Miner who goes by the name of Tom

156
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,639
Liston

157

158
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,259
crypto coin

159
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,259
The long-lost Treasure of the undead toe

160
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,860
I can't believe it I'd love to Quest for

161
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,080
such a treasure in a mine but there

162
