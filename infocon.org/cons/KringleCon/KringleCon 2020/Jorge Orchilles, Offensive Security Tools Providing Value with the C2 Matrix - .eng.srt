00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,280
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,680
and welcome to my talk on offensive

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,879
security tools

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,559
providing value with the c2 matrix

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,040
my name is georgio chias and i'm so

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,120
excited to be here

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,240
first off i have to thank santa thanks

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
santa called me he invited me up to the

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,279
north pole

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,279
and i'm originally from venezuela which

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,519
is a caribbean country

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,000
it's generally very warm i now live in

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
miami which is still very warm

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,920
about 90 95 degrees fahrenheit every day

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,640
and i came up with very short notice

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
didn't even have time to get the right

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,120
clothes

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,520
so you see me here wearing my uh our

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,079
trademark unicorn shirts here

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
very purple because uh i'm bringing all

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,320
purple over to

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
santa this holiday season i know uh

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
it's all about the red and green but i'm

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,360
all about the purple

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,879
so let's get to it

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
who am i my name is george or chias i'm

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
the chief technology officer

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,600
at site and i've been doing offensive

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
security for a number of years

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
i led the offensive security team at

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,240
citigroup for 10 of those years

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,439
before then i was a system admin and i

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,880
wrote a book on windows 7 an

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
operating system you should not be using

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,159
today

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
and when i finished with

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
doing system admin stuff i worked in a

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,720
security operations center

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
then i went to the dark side

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
to work on the offensive side and i

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,799
started doing vulnerability assessment

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
then built out a penetration testing

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
team then a red team

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
and then a purple team function which is

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
what we're going to talk about today

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,360
so evolution of offensive security

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,600
this is really how i personally went

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,439
through this journey in the last 10 or

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,320
so years

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,560
also talked to a lot of people as i'm a

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,159
sans instructor as well

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
so i get to talk to a lot of people that

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
are building out these offensive

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
security programs

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,520
and more or less they go something like

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
this you start with vulnerability

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,240
scanning

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,318
where you run a nessus or a rapid seven

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,440
against a number of ips and web apps

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
then you get this really long report

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,480
after that you have someone that goes

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
through that report that's called the

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
vulnerability assessment

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
you do risk rating i did a lot of work

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
with that was part of the

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
common vulnerability scoring system

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
working group so we released version 3

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
and 3.1 which is the current

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
and then we got to a point where we were

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
exploiting vulnerabilities

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
that was a lot of fun that was pen

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,200
testing

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
then we noticed that you don't just test

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360
technology but you take

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
test people and processing there we

76
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
built out the red team

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
from the red team we realized that doing

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
all these zero knowledge engagements all

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,120
the time

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
weren't bringing the most value because

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
a lot of things weren't being fixed

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
so we built out a purple team function

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,480
and then lastly we realized that

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
individual ttps by themselves

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
don't really say much you really have to

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
create attack chains and then that's

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,440
when we started doing

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,480
adversary emulation so um anything i

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,159
reference you'll see links here so this

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,680
was a blog post i did

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
on uh that journey if you want to read a

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
little bit more about it

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
so offensive security was always and

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
should always be about providing

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
value right every assessment you do

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,680
has a number of different objectives you

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
have a scope you have a rules of

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,920
engagement

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
but at the end of the day the reason

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
that you were hired

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,319
whether you're an internal team or a

102
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
consultant was to bring

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,879
value sure some of you were bought hired

104
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,440
to

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
check off that box right that compliance

106
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,799
but you're still

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
providing some value so

108
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,879
something that occurred to us uh about

109
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400
six years ago was

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
exploitation is very valuable we like

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
doing exploitation we like finding o

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,120
days

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
and reporting them to vendors

114
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
responsibly maybe through bug bounty

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
make a little money

116
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
and those get fixed and those

117
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
vulnerabilities are fixed and that's

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
awesome super valuable super fun

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
but i remember clearly all the way back

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
in 2011

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
i was taking sans security 560 with ed

122
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,560
scotus

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
it was ctf day day six and

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,320
i was just trying to exploit everything

125
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,880
but

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,919
in that ctf you really only exploit

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,520
maybe one host

128
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,759
and that's when ed saw that i was stuck

129
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,960
and he came by

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
and he told me it is not all about

131
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,759
exploitation

132
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,040
and i looked at him and i kept trying to

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,320
metasplay my way through this etf

134
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,800
but then i realized it took me a couple

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
years to realize that indeed it's not

136
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,680
all about

137
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
exploitation exploitation is important

138
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
but there's more to that

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
perfect example is mitre i'm sure all of

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
you have heard of mitre

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
migra has cve common vulnerabilities and

142
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,000
exposures right if you find a

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,039
vulnerability

144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,320
awesome good job report it you either

145
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,160
gain your cv or generally you tell the

146
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
vendor the vendor

147
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
that has this vulnerability will create

148
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
a patch and then they create a cbe

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,880
awesome that's its own portal

150
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,240
cd.miner.org but then they have this

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
other thing now i'm sure you've heard

152
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,479
about

153
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,440
called attack adversary tactics

154
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
techniques and common knowledge

155
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,479
and this is more about behaviors the

156
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,520
best way i can

157
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,880
show you this is that cves we get

158
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,479
thousands of them every year

159
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,759
while in attack we have techniques and

160
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,960
sub techniques

161
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,560
and i actually counted them there's 525

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
techniques and sub techniques and the 12

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
or so tactics

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
and if you do a search for the word

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,479
exploit it's only referenced in nine of

166
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,400
these techniques and sub techniques

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
meaning that there's a lot of adversary

168
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
behavior

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,479
that does not rely on exploits

170
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,400
another method of focusing and

171
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,919
giving back and really giving value

172
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,639
in your assessments is working under an

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,080
assumed breach

174
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
uh method or mode and sansa told me i

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
was talking to him when i got up here um

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
he they operate in soon breach mode they

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
know they're going to be

178
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,240
compromised right if you've been to any

179
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,520
of the cringle cons

180
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
you know very well what can happen right

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,199
and many organizations are starting to

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,720
work under this mode as well

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
and pretty much what that means is that

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
everyone will be compromised at some

185
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,919
point right

186
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
that's just the way it is right it's

187
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,600
gonna happen

188
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,520
maybe a patch is not gonna be applied in

189
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
time and it's gonna get exploited

190
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,639
maybe um a user will fall for a phishing

191
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,240
campaign

192
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,280
but it's gonna happen right so

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,120
that mode is very important it's very

194
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,800
important when we do our assessments as

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
well

196
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
because what happens next is what

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
matters once someone gets in

198
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,199
what happens next will you get detected

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
so one of the methods that we found to

200
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
bring the most value while doing

201
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,720
offensive security

202
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,759
is through purple team and these

203
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
unlike red team engagements are full

204
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,199
knowledge

205
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,680
exercises and a purple team is actually

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,759
a virtual team it's a functional team

207
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,440
where you have multiple teams working

208
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,960
together you have your cyber threat

209
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,160
intelligence team

210
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,919
you have your red team and you have your

211
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
blue team we've released

212
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,319
a free public framework for this called

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,240
purple team exercise framework the link

214
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,120
is down there

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
and of course you can go and download it

216
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,199
right now and implement this but

217
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,240
let me tell you why first of all cyber

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
threat intelligence is very

219
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
important for your organization some

220
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
organizations have internal cyber threat

221
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,879
intelligence teams

222
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,080
some have external but many people think

223
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
that this is only about indicators of

224
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,319
compromise oh this bad domain or this

225
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,759
bad ip

226
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,199
but it's not it's a lot more

227
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,759
it's more about adversary behaviors what

228
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,879
we want to talk about

229
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,280
so a cyber threat intelligence analyst

230
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,639
working for a company or

231
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,960
as a vendor a consultant needs to

232
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,039
understand the target organization

233
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,680
they need to identify adversaries that

234
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,879
are likely to attack that organization

235
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
then gather threat intelligence about

236
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
that particular adversary

237
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
extract the ttps those are tactics

238
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
techniques and procedures

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
or also the adversary behaviors if you

240
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,559
will then they analyze and organize this

241
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,279
information

242
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,240
they create a plan and then you emulate

243
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
the adversary now you can do this from a

244
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
red team perspective

245
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
where the blue team doesn't know about

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,839
it or you can do it as a purple team

247
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
now who's the red team they are the

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
offensive team right

249
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
and red team i love the red team journal

250
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,839
they're back follow them on twitter

251
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,399
redteamjournal.com they have the

252
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
definition that red teaming is the

253
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
practice of looking at problem or

254
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,320
situation

255
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
from the perspective of an adversary but

256
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,880
really what we're doing is we're testing

257
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,839
measuring and improving right business

258
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,800
value

259
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,440
people process and technology not only

260
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,959
vulnerabilities in tech

261
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,720
but vulnerabilities and people and

262
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,560
processes as well

263
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,640
who are the blue team well the blue team

264
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
are the defenders now

265
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
you don't go and fight look up blue team

266
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,839
and find a job as a blue team or blue

267
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,480
teamers

268
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
are a lot of people right there's a lot

269
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
of defenders from security operations

270
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
analysts to manage security service

271
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
providers detection engineers

272
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,920
incident response forensics right

273
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
there's a lot of people that fall into

274
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,560
this and they're great

275
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
we love our defenders they do a great

276
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,040
job and their main role is to detect and

277
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,160
respond

278
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,040
to attacks now so far hopefully i've

279
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,120
talked enough saying that prevention

280
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
does not mean detection right at some

281
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
point someone might get in you didn't

282
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
prevent them now you have to detect them

283
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,240
how do you detect them well in the

284
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
simplest way possible you need to log

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,800
them

286
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
log what they're doing see what they're

287
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
doing get relevant logs

288
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
start locally and then send those logs

289
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,000
somewhere

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
then based on the logs that you receive

291
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,680
create alerts

292
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
and alert people follow a process

293
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
and then get to the response phase where

294
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
you actually respond and uh you have

295
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
process people and

296
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,560
automation for them so what's the flow

297
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,839
of a purple team engagement

298
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
first you all get together there's a lot

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
of planning that goes into it read the

300
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,720
framework if you want to know more about

301
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,279
that but

302
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,360
once everyone's together either on the

303
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
same room or all through video like we

304
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,079
are now

305
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,760
cyber thor intelligence presents the

306
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
adversary presents the tactics

307
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
techniques and procedures and technical

308
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
details

309
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,839
then the attendees have a tabletop

310
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,680
discussion this is a great discussion

311
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,240
because

312
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,839
you hear everyone's assumptions of

313
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,000
things that will work and won't work

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
and then you have the red team actually

315
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
emulate those ttps actually run those

316
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,519
ttps in the target environment

317
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,560
while the blues team watches then the

318
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,600
blue team goes

319
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,279
they follow their process they detect

320
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,040
and respond to his ttps

321
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
all while sharing their screen so now

322
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
the red team is learning how the blue

323
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,440
team works

324
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
it's fantastic then you document your

325
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,640
results

326
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,200
what worked what didn't work if you can

327
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
perform adjustments

328
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
then repeat the ttps and then go through

329
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
and do this over and over you can do

330
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,839
this in a one hour two hour exercise or

331
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
a week long exercise

332
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
of course to emulate adversaries you

333
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
need tools that's where the c2 matrix

334
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,399
comes in

335
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,880
c2 matrix is a collaborative evaluation

336
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,399
it's really a google sheet but there's a

337
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
website called the c2matrix.com

338
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
there are 60 command and control

339
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,240
frameworks

340
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
that you have available for you

341
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
um there's a lot they're free there's

342
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,399
some that are paid for

343
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,880
and there's also a how-to that teaches

344
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,440
you

345
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
how to use any of these frameworks

346
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,639
and what we've done along with

347
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,959
collaboration with sans and ryan o'grady

348
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,079
shout out to ryan

349
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,000
is we have created a virtual machine

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
called the sans slingshot

351
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
c2 matrix edition and the goal of this

352
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
is to lower the learning curve for you

353
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
instead of having to install any of

354
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
these you get straight to testing it

355
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,560
comes with eight of these c2s

356
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,680
already pre-installed and then you can

357
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,519
just use them you can follow the how-tos

358
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,680
on howto.c2matrix.com

359
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,519
you can set up things like empire or

360
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,360
apostle 2 or covenant

361
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
or merlin or sliver all these awesome

362
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
c2s

363
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
and then you have to provide value so

364
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
this is an example of a six week long

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
purple team exercise we were actually

366
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
hired to do

367
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,279
the cyber threat intelligence red team

368
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:33,839
blue team

369
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,519
and exercise coordinator so we brought

370
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,240
big team in uh to this organization

371
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
and we didn't assume breach scenario

372
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,639
that means that we ran everything

373
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,440
internally

374
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
we did not focus on fishing or

375
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
exploitation we

376
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
started on a system and we emulated a

377
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
variety of different apts from russian

378
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,040
to iranian

379
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,160
to chinese and we track this we use

380
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,519
vector and that's what you can see here

381
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,120
on the right and as you can see the

382
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
results weren't too

383
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
too pretty we tested 65 unique ttps

384
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,639
and only three of those were detected

385
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
while one of them was blocked

386
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,639
all of the others were not detected

387
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,600
meaning that

388
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
if this adversary would have gone and

389
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,680
targeted this organization

390
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
they would have achieved their objective

391
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
without being detected

392
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,519
after these six weeks we didn't spend

393
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,120
any money on technology

394
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
we only tuned what was already available

395
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
we enabled telemetry through cismod

396
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,360
we created logics and alerts on their

397
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,959
sim and at the end

398
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,800
we didn't get to 100 right this isn't

399
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,560
bingo but

400
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,320
we had 64 detection rate that means that

401
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,639
if

402
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,160
any of these adversaries would have

403
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
gotten onto this target system

404
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
they would have been detected and

405
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
responded to before they reach their

406
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,320
objective

407
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,079
and we did that using a tool called

408
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,240
vector vector is free

409
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,279
and it's for tracking and showing

410
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,240
measuring and showing value of your red

411
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,279
and purple team

412
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,199
engagements highly encourage you to

413
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,279
check that out it also comes as part of

414
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:03,920
the sans

415
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,320
slingshot c2 matrix edition so you get

416
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
eight command control frameworks

417
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
and you also get vector for tracking

418
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,920
that also use the how to

419
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,760
because there we show you how to use

420
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
everything

421
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
so with that i want to thank you all i

422
