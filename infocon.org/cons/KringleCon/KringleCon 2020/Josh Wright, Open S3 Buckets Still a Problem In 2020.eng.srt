to get me up here to the north pole

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
and today i'm going to be speaking about

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,560
open s3 buckets

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,760
still a problem in 2020 my name is

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,800

and i'm a technical director for counter

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,880
hack

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
working alongside this amazing team here

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,280
doing penetration testing work but also

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,760
putting

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,480
all the energy we have into developing

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,800
the

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,160
amazing holiday hack challenge every

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,800
year

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,960
so thank you to all of the amazing

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
people on the counter hack team

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,960
and i'm always thrilled that the chance

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,960
to work with all these amazing folks

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
so uh i'm going to be talking about a

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
problem that we call

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
insecure buckets which is something that

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,000
i would not have

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
uh predicted that we'd still need to

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,040
talk about

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
in 2020 yet here we are

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
and it seems like on an almost weekly

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,320
basis we see a new

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
major breach happen where significant

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,720
information is discovered publicly

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
available on the internet

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
in open in insecure amazon

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
s3 buckets and this has affected all

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,079
sorts of different verticals

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,280
not just uh finance but education

43
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,119
manufacturing health care insurance

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,159
industry and

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,360
many other places besides

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,159
now these buckets these s3 buckets are

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,960
just

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,159
fundamentally a cloud storage mechanism

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,560
it's amazon's simple storage service

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
which we refer to as s3

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
and it's basically just an object

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
storage mechanism they're designed to

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,960
store

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,240
data it's similar in nature to having

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,200
files that are stored on your local file

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,920
system

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
and they can be used to store resources

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
for public or

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,720
for private use now early on when amazon

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,360
came out with

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,840
s3 and people would create these s3

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,959
buckets for storage

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
they would default to public access so

64
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
if you didn't make any changes to

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
improve the security of your bucket

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,360
the data would just be publicly

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,520
accessible now amazon changed that

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
setting a long time ago

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
yet we still have a lot of data that

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,959
gets

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
disclosed publicly as people either kind

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
of stumble across

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
or intentionally seek out and try to

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
find these public buckets

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,400
now amazon is doing what it can to try

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
to make it so that these buckets

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
are not publicly shared or at least

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
are easily recognizable when they are

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,120
publicly shared

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
yet we still see lots of these public

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
buckets disclosing

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
really sensitive information as an

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,760
admin if you go to the amazon s3 console

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,159
page

85
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,879
and you go to the uh bucket creation

86
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,519
page

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,680
you can list and enumerate all of the

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
buckets that you've created and here we

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,519
can see that i have a bucket

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
called josh's private stuff

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
and you can see on the right hand side

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,840
here that is

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
even clearly labeled as public

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,319
now that's a pretty strong indicator

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,200
that any data that's in that bucket

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,840
should

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
not be sensitive because it is public

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,159
and accessible

99
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,560
yet many organizations either are

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
looking or don't understand the

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
implications of having a public bucket

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
resource like this and what we're seeing

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,319
is

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,080
other people discover them they

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,239
enumerate the data and the files in

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:48,799
those

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
bucket resources and then are often

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
stumbling across

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,879
sensitive or very damaging types of

110
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,840
information

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
for the target organization or their

112
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,239
customers

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,080
now every one of these buckets has

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
what's called a bucket identifier and

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
that identifier is what we call an

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,799
amazon

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,760
resource name or an arn here we can see

118
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,439
the amazon resource name is

119
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,720
arn aws s3 couple colons

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,279
and then whatever that bucket id or that

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,720
bucket name is

122
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
now every bucket that exists in amazon

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
s3 has a bucket name

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
and the bucket name is chosen by the

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
user creating the bucket

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,040
and it must be globally unique so if you

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
add a bucket you can supply a name but

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,919
if you supply a name

129
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,560
such as oracle for example that's

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,919
already taken and you're gonna have to

131
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,440
choose a different name

132
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
now whenever these buckets are created

133
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
we can access them over several

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
protocols but one of the common ways

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
that people access these buckets

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,840
is over http or or https

137
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,840
where the url https colon slash slash

138
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,639
s3.amazonaws.com

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,680
slash and then the name of the bucket

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
itself josh's private stuff or whatever

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
that bucket name

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
will actually allow the user to access

143
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
those resources

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
now in this case we've got a public

145
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
bucket josh's private stuff and if you

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,479
browse

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,720
to the url s3 amazon aws.com

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
josh's private stuff you'll be able to

149
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,680
access the resource or the resources

150
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
in that bucket now if this

151
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
is a non-us specific region

152
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,720
sometimes we see s3 region codes that

153
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
are used for

154
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
region specific locales but amazon will

155
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,199
also

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
redirect those buckets to those region

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,479
specific locales as well

158
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
this configuration detail is what we

159
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
need to understand

160
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
before we start talking about how to

161
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,400
find

162
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
these amazon buckets if they're secured

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,400
or they're insecure

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
and the nature of the data that's stored

165
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,639
in these buckets

166
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,840
s3.amazonaws.com

167
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
and then that bucket name that we're

168
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
looking for

169
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,479
now it turns out that there are a lot of

170
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,880
open buckets out there on the internet

171
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,039
the interesting part for us is

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,479
identifying them

173
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,440
and figuring out if they distribute

174
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
sensitive information

175
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,319
so what we're going to talk about next

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,000
is how do we do that how do we

177
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
find those resources and how do we

178
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
retrieve that information

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
well there's several tools that we can

180
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,440
use for this

181
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,720
robin wood who is a friend of mine and

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
has done a lot of amazing work for the

183
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,479
information security community

184
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
he wrote an early term called bucket

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,039
fund an early tool called bucket finder

186
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
bucket finder is a ruby script that

187
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
takes a word list of terms

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
and uses every one of those word list of

189
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,880
terms

190
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
to try to see if that term is

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,960
matching an arn an amazon resource name

192
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,280
to

193
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,479
identify an s3 bucket so you can see

194
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,880
here in my word list i did a cat word

195
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
list and i've got a couple of lines here

196
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,039
normally these files would be quite long

197
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,280
but here we just have a couple of lines

198
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,160
private dash gringlecon josh's private

199
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,639
stuff

200
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
and oracle to use bucket finder we just

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
run the bucketfinder.rb script

202
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,280
and then we specify whatever that word

203
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,880
list file is

204
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,479
and what bucket finder will do is go to

205
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,520
s3.amazonaws.com

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
and then every one of those words in the

207
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
word list

208
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,199
now i've also added the dash dash

209
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
download argument which you would

210
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,360
probably

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,919
not do when you're just running this

212
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,000
tool to scan through a large list of

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,639
files

214
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
but you would use that if you want to

215
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,160
retrieve everything

216
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,800
in a given bucket that's because in this

217
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,520
process

218
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,599
you may find lots of buckets that are

219
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
public but you might not want to

220
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
download everything from all those

221
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,039
buckets you want be might want to be a

222
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,680
little bit more

223
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
choosy but here we specify dash dash

224
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,120
download

225
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
and the first entry we can see the

226
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,160
bucket does not exist

227
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,039
private dash gringo con is not a bucket

228
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,039
the bucket josh's private stuff

229
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,240
does exist and what bucket finder will

230
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
do is enumerate all the files and then

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
download

232
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,599
the file from that bucket now the third

233
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
bucket oracle also exists

234
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
but is not a public bucket it's a

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
private bucket

236
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
so our access is denied now just using

237
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,080
this tool we can come up with our own

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
word list and try to find those

239
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
unprotected buckets and then retrieve

240
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,759
the information from

241
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,958
those bucket resources

242
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,279
now there are also other cloud resources

243
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,880
to find this as well

244
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,839
grey hat warfare

245
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,240
buckets.greyhoundwarfare.com

246
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,200
has a resource that allows us to search

247
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,159
from known

248
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
public buckets what they do at grey hat

249
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
warfare is that they're constantly kind

250
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
of refining their own word list

251
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
constantly scanning for new buckets that

252
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,320
are created

253
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
and then indexing and retrieving

254
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,720
information about those resources

255
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
so that they're easy to find now this is

256
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
a free resource

257
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
but it is also a commercial resource and

258
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:05,920
i

259
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,600
personally have had difficulty getting

260
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
this to work well for me

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
this is a nice resource for a quick

262
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
search but it's

263
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
not comprehensive and it only gives you

264
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
incomplete results

265
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
if you're not a paid user as a free user

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
you're only limited to searching a

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,720
couple thousand of the millions of files

268
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
that have been indexed with this tool

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
so while this can be useful it's mostly

270
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,680
going to be useful for paid accounts

271
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,120
not for free access

272
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,160
now you might ask how do i find buckets

273
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,000
that people haven't found before

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,560
a lot of people have run bucket finder

275
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
using their own word lists

276
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
a lot of people use the gray fat grey

277
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
hat warfare tool

278
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
to be able to find bucket resources as

279
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
well how do i find things that

280
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,959
other people haven't yet found new

281
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,560
bucket discovery is about

282
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
creativity and also staying current new

283
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,519
buckets are being created all the time

284
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,880
somebody that scanned for buckets

285
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
yesterday won't find something

286
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
that was created as a new bucket today

287
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,760
so keeping on top of these tools

288
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
but i think even more importantly is

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
about applying your own creativity so

290
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,079
look at this for an example

291
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,279
a bucket with the arn arn aws

292
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,120
s3 microsoft probably won't uncover

293
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,959
a public bucket if you search for a

294
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
bucket called microsoft that bucket

295
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,279
probably exists i'm pretty sure it does

296
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,320
and it's going to be

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
a private bucket that you're not going

298
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
to be able to access

299
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
but how about a different name something

300
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,959
like msdev

301
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,240
dash east dash cortana 2020

302
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,839
that might identify a bucket that nobody

303
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
has found before

304
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
so a lot of bucket discovery comes down

305
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,640
to you

306
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,279
using your creativity and coming up with

307
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,480
a word list

308
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
that will find things that nobody has

309
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,839
found before

310
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
you might start with a basic word list

311
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,839
just google for s3 bucket word list and

312
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,680
there's many to get started with

313
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,959
and then add suffixes and prefixes to

314
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,600
all those words for a specific company

315
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
that you might be targeting in a pen

316
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
test or some kind of an assessment

317
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
add the company name or an abbreviation

318
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
or the stock ticker quote

319
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,000
or maybe specific products or versions

320
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
of products or abbreviations for

321
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,560
products

322
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
consider adding region specific

323
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
information such as countries country

324
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
abbreviation provinces

325
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
states cities things like that also

326
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
don't forget just to look for basic

327
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
names if you have a product let's say a

328
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,440
new soho router or some kind of a device

329
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
maybe it's the product name itself that

330
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
will reveal a bucket

331
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
and maybe just nobody's found it yet

332
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
the process of identifying new buckets

333
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,839
is

334
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
doing it often try to find buckets that

335
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,120
may have been created

336
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,720
recently but also being creative

337
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
in the selection of the word list that

338
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
you're using to identify those buckets

339
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
as well

340
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,079
now we've been talking about s3 buckets

341
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,839
which is amazon specific

342
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,920
but this is not an amazon specific

343
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,880
problem

344
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,079
for microsoft azure cloud we have azure

345
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:12,880
blobs

346
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,320
and we've even seen recent

347
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,560
vulnerabilities where azure blobs

348
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
expose lots of public information such

349
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
as this case where

350
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,839
automatic license plate numbers and how

351
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,440
they do image recognition for the

352
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
company tesco

353
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,440
was recently disclosed now i've been

354
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,959
speaking with robin wood

355
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,079
his handle on twitter's at digit ninja

356
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,160
and we've been talking about how we can

357
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
discover these azure blobs using

358
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
automated scanning tools

359
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,000
to the best of my knowledge there isn't

360
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
a simple tool

361
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
like bucket finder that robin created

362
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,279
for s3 buckets

363
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,120
but hopefully robin will be able to come

364
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
up with another tool for us

365
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
in the future that can also do this kind

366
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
of scanning for azure blob

367
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,839
data as well i think it's also

368
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,880
interesting that

369
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,120
you can even make money finding insecure

370
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
s3 buckets

371
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
and if you go to websites like bug

372
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,680
bounty programs at hackerone.com

373
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,959
activity you can search for s3

374
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,839
or amazon or azure blob or just the

375
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,200
keyword bucket

376
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
and you can see where bounties have been

377
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
paid out

378
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,079
for the discovery of insecure s3 buckets

379
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,040
in the past

380
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,639
this is an article i found where

381
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,360
somebody claims to have gotten 1500

382
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
and it just took this person 15 minutes

383
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,639
to find an

384
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
insecure amazon s3 bucket so this can

385
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,000
also be a way to maybe even pick up some

386
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
side cash doing this kind of analysis as

387
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
well

388
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,639
now let's talk about some defenses what

389
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
can we do well i'm a big fan of

390
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
active defense through offense using

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
tools like bucket finder to scan your

392
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
own organization

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,839
and look for buckets that might match

394
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,680
what's going on in your company before

395
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
an attacker can find them

396
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
now if you also have access to locking

397
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,000
resources in your company

398
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
that can be another really valuable

399
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,279
source of information

400
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,839
so if you have access to dns server name

401
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,680
lookups within your organization

402
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
or proxy logs or endpoint detection or

403
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,800
response reports on host systems that

404
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,040
might indicate what websites people are

405
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
browsing to

406
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,959
or visiting or resolving with dns

407
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,600
i would look through all of those for

408
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
s3.amazonaws.com

409
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,560
just to try to identify bucket names

410
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,199
then

411
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
with the list of those bucket names test

412
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,399
them yourself

413
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
are they public do they disclose

414
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,839
sensitive information

415
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
and if they do then ask yourself well

416
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
who controls this bucket

417
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,360
and if you can identify that ask

418
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
yourself is there a mechanism to report

419
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
these vulnerabilities

420
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
either directly to the person that is

421
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,560
controlling the bucket or the company

422
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,760
controlling the bucket

423
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
or through some kind of a bug bounty

424
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,519
program again

425
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
be creative in your wordless generation

426
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,399
use what you can learn from monitoring

427
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,079
your own organization

428
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,560
and try to mutate those bucket names to

429
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,360
see if you can

430
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,519
find other things that maybe nobody else

431
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,440
has found yet

432
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
for your own organization you should

433
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
consider setting

434
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
and enforcing policies where if you are

435
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
using s3 buckets

436
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,000
they require authenticated access and

437
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,800
furthermore

438
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,959
they do not disclose personally

439
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,959
identifiable information

440
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,199
you should also audit your organization

441
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,320
in how s3 buckets may be used or even

442
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
third-party comparable services such as

443
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,600
azure blobs

444
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,480
and not just for your organization but

445
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
what are your partner organizations

446
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,279
doing

447
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,320
with your data as well remember

448
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
a lot of s3 breaches are not from the

449
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,480
main organization

450
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
but from partner organizations with your

451
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,160
data i hope this was a useful look and a

452
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,759
quick introduction for you

453
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,959
to be able to look at some of the

454
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,560
vulnerabilities and some of the issues

455
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,360
associated with

456
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
s3 buckets i encourage you to spend some

457
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,680
time looking at tools

458
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,320
like bucket finder being creative in

459
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
your wordless generation

460
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,720
and spend some time trying to find some

461
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,360
of those

462
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
exposed in public s3 buckets out on the

463
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,600
internet

464
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,839
again my name is joshua wright and i

465
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,839
thank you for coming to cringlecon
