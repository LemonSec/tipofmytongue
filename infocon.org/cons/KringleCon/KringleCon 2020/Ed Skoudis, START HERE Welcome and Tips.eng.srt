that we have here is

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,240
nefarious

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,560
holiday super villain we try to build

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
family friendly way so if you have kids

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,000
you can play along with the kids

they can work on some of the video game

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,119
components you can work on the cyber

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,600
security components and vice versa

45
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
we have challenges that range from very

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
easy for people who are beginners

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
all the way up to very challenging and

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
we try to tell you

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
in your badge you'll see the badge in

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
just a little bit but we try to tell you

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,000
in the badge

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,840
which are the easier challenges and

53
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
which are the ones that are more

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,840
difficult

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
so that you can kind of focus on your

56
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
skill level plus there's lots of hints

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
throughout the challenges

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
so that you can develop your skills

59
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
while having some good holiday fun

60
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
now there's various components of the

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,439
sands holiday hack challenge

62
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,399
i mean one of the most important

63
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
components is these high quality

64
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
in-depth focused challenges we call them

65
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
objectives and you're going to see a

66
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
bunch of objectives in your badge

67
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,439
when you arrive at the north pole we

68
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
also have some great

69
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,120
terminal challenges this is where in the

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
game you'll click on a little

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
terminal we call them a cranberry pi

72
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,239
terminal you click on the terminal and

73
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:16,959
it'll pop

74
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
up a command shell for you and you have

75
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,800
to help an elf do

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,280
something in that terminal when you help

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,640
the elf do something

78
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
that elf will give you hints to help you

79
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
with your objectives

80
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,879
now the sans holiday hack challenge also

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
features a virtual conference

82
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,080
called kringlecon 3 french hens you can

83
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,760
see the three french hens on the screen

84
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,879
here and you'll see them when you get

85
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
into the game

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
this virtual conference includes some

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,239
very fun short talks

88
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,959
like this one and many of these talks

89
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,599
will give you

90
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,560
hints and ideas for you to solve the

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
objectives

92
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
that's a really unique aspect of

93
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,519
kringlecon because it's a conference

94
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,319
virtually hosted at the north pole where

95
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,920
you will learn things at that conference

96
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
that you can then directly apply

97
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,040
to solving the challenges associated

98
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,159
with that conference

99
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,080
it's also a virtual world for you to

100
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
explore and socialize you can interact

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,360
with other players

102
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,000
and have fun we also have a free album

103
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,519
of highly engaging

104
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,680
customized holiday music created just

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,519
for the sans holiday hack challenge

106
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
and we have a whole bunch of mini games

107
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
included in this

108
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,799
these are small video games that teach

109
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,920
some important lessons

110
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,599
and each of our mini games are

111
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
inherently hackable so if you don't want

112
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,560
to play the game itself

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
you could always hack through it to get

114
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
to the given objective

115
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
beyond that game so we do hope you have

116
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
a lot of fun with this thing

117
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
the team has been working for over 15

118
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,239
months

119
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,920
building this thing to share with you

120
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,120
now we have some great speakers at

121
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,319
kringlecon3

122
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,680
some of these names you may recognize

123
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
some you may not but these are

124
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,200
just tremendous cyber security

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
professionals that wanted to share with

126
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,680
you

127
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
some of their insight now i'm not

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
telling you that every single one of

129
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,879
these talks

130
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
will give you hints for your objectives

131
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
but many of them will

132
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
you might want to look carefully at the

133
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
different objectives that you're going

134
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,840
to face

135
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,080
in the holiday hack challenge and then

136
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
look at these different talks

137
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,680
to see where you might be able to pick

138
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
up some tips and tricks for how to solve

139
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,238
that given objective

140
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,560
now this year we're more interactive

141
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
than ever and we have more community

142
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
support than ever

143
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
first of all this is the first time that

144
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
the sans holiday hack channel has ever

145
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
had

146
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,720
an official chat infrastructure people

147
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
have been asking us about this

148
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,880
for years so what we did this year is we

149
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
set up a 2020

150
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
discord channel in fact it's a whole set

151
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,000
of channels

152
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,919
and you can pop into these channels and

153
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,199
interact with other players

154
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,440
as well as people from our team we have

155
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
both voice channels

156
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
as well as text channels so you can

157
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,919
interact with each other

158
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,919
we also have channels that are dedicated

159
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,320
to specific objectives and challenges so

160
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
you can focus there

161
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,759
so that's a pretty pretty exciting new

162
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,120
thing that we have here

163
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
if you want to get more information

164
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,479
about joining the discord

165
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639

166
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,000
challenge you can look at

167
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,240

look at that webpage and it'll tell you

169
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
how to join the discord session

170
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
we've also added another new thing this

171
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,960
year we call kringle

172
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,400
concierges and what this is is during

173
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
the first couple of weeks after launch

174
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
when you log into discord and you're

175
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
logged into the game

176
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,039
you can look inside the general channel

177
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,320
within discord

178
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
and we will have a series of volunteers

179
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
there that will welcome you

180
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
into the holiday hack challenge this

181
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,800
year now those folks are not there for

182
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,880
technical support they're essentially

183
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
there to kind of greet you

184
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,919
and if you need help kind of

185
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,680
understanding what to do they can give

186
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
you some direction on how to get started

187
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
they're almost like the shopping store

188
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
greeters that you see it at some

189
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
retailers during the holiday season oh

190
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,639
other things that we have this year

191
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,479
uh soundtrack we've been releasing the

192
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,919
soundtracks for holiday hack challenge

193
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,039
for the last five years

194
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
but we always released them as mp3s that

195
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,400
you could download

196
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
but very few people download mp3s these

197
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,160
days so this year

198
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,479
for the first time ever we have uploaded

199
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,000
all the holiday hack challenge

200
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
music from previous years 2016

201
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,800
2017 2018 2019

202
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,880
we've uploaded all of that onto the

203
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,479
major streaming channels

204
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,880
spotify apple music amazon music and

205
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
more and i'm also here to tell you

206
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,080
the holiday hack challenge 2020 music is

207
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
uploaded to all of these streaming

208
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
services as well

209
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
and i'm really excited about the music

210
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
this year the music is

211
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
very heavily integrated into the

212
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,520
storyline and

213
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
theme of the holiday hack challenge so i

214
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
think you'll have a lot of fun with that

215
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,639
you can certainly listen to the music in

216
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,639
the game it's been carefully placed at

217
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
strategic points in the game to help

218
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
tell the story or you could also listen

219
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
to it

220
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,680
via your favorite streaming service and

221
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
this year we have more mini games

222
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
teaching vital skills and as i said

223
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
they're all hackable as well

224
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,960
uh in past holiday hack challenges we

225
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
might have had one or two mini games

226
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,039
this year depending on how you count

227
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,039
there are four or five different mini

228
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,599
games

229
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,720
and i hope you have fun with those now

230
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
at the end of last year's holiday hack

231
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,919
challenge

232
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,560
we had a bit of a cliffhanger so what we

233
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
wanted to do last year was to have you

234
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,919
resolve the challenge and get to the

235
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
final screen in fact this is the final

236
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
screen that you'd see

237
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
from the 2019 sans holiday hack

238
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,840
challenge

239
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,080
and there you have defeated the tooth

240
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,160
fairy and her plan for destroying the

241
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
holiday season

242
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,880
yup so there she is in her orange

243
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
jumpsuit because she's going

244
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,240
to prison and krampus he he's a

245
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,560
a good helper that helps you and santa

246
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
claus bring the tooth fairy to justice

247
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
you can see santa claus there as well

248
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
but we tried to put in this little

249
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
cliffhanger thing if you look

250
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
just behind krampus you can see there's

251
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
a scrap of paper on the ground

252
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,840
i'm talking about that little scrap of

253
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,759
paper there yeah if you

254
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,840
clicked on that scrap of paper on the

255
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
closing sequence

256
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
from last year's holiday hack challenge

257
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,160
up would pop

258
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
this scrap in the

259
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,759
tooth fairy's own handwriting saying

260
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,479
this

261
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
thankfully i didn't have to implement my

262
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,759
plan by myself

263
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,080
jack frost promised to use his wintry

264
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
magic to help me subvert

265
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,840
santa's horrible reign of holiday

266
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,639
merriment

267
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
now and forever in other words

268
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
at the end of last year's holiday hack

269
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
challenge you found out

270
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,759
that the tooth fairy was working with

271
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,960
jack frost

272
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
and i'm here to tell you jack frost is

273
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,399
going to be your villain this year

274
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,599
now you might say well if i already know

275
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,200
who the villain is what's the point of

276
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,559
this year's challenge

277
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,958
ah you're going to have to figure out

278
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,760
what the villain's nefarious plan is

279
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
and then you're going to have to thwart

280
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
that plan we tried to set this up

281
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
inspired by some of those movies like

282
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
the incredibles do you remember when the

283
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
incredibles

284
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
first defeat syndrome at the end of the

285
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,720
original incredibles movie

286
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
as soon as they defeat him out of the

287
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
ground comes mole man who announces his

288
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,760
plan

289
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
that was kind of our idea with this

290
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
inspired by the incredibles

291
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
you defeat the tooth fairy and then

292
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,560
suddenly you realize jack

293
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
frost is on the loose so more about this

294
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,279
year's story

295
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,040
if you look in the holiday hack

296
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
challenge universe

297
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,160
back in 2018 we had a

298
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
kringle con conference it was our first

299
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
ever inside of santa's castle

300
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
and it was fun but it got really crowded

301
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
so in 2019

302
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,880
last year we moved the the kringle con

303
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
to a new venue we moved it to elf

304
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,240
university

305
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
at the time it was the largest venue at

306
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
the north pole but even that got kind of

307
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,040
crowded

308
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
so what santa did starting about a year

309
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,200
ago was he engaged in a massive

310
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,240
construction project

311
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
all the elves worked on it and the idea

312
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
was to increase the size of santa's

313
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,200
castle

314
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,519
to add many more floors and to add an

315
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,560
elevator

316
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
it's a magical elevator so that you

317
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
could whisk around

318
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,399
inside the castle we also added a nice

319
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,000
big courtyard out back

320
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,519
and tried to make the whole thing even

321
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,680
more beautiful so this huge construction

322
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,160
project

323
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
started about a year ago and it's almost

324
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,519
done

325
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
not quite there you might still see some

326
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
things uh like some ladders around and

327
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,440
some of the elves are still wearing hard

328
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
hats you might see a hammer and some

329
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,240
nails here and there

330
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
um pardon our dust but we're just about

331
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
finished with this

332
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,480
huge new castle that you can participate

333
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,800
in

334
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
so we've got the courtyard the magical

335
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
elevator there's a networ's room on the

336
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,760
roof

337
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,480
it's really really cool but i gotta tell

338
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,040
you

339
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200

342
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,839

343

346
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
you might want to keep an eye on that

347
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
i'm sure it'll turn out okay though

353
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,640
with cloud

354
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,959
and wireless protocols we've got some

355
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,079
web app stuff

356
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,320

357
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,120

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
now i'd like to give you a little bit of

365
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
insight into game controls and

366
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,800
in-game chat when you log into the game

367
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,399
and you go to holidayheckchallenge.com

368
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
create your account log into the game

369
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,800
you're going to be presented at the top

370
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,079
right of your screen

371
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,399
with some of the controls the question

372
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
mark there that you click on that it'll

373
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,800
give you help

374
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,959
you can also control audio turning it on

375
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,399
or off you can

376
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,640
hide the chat or show the chat because

377
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,920
we have integrated chat right there on

378
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
the right hand side

379
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
you can toggle on or off speech bubbles

380
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,040
and then if you click on that little

381
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
head and shoulders icon

382
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
that allows you to edit your account

383
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,639
including to change your avatar so you

384
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,079
can change your avatar's face

385
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
or head or torso or legs or whatever

386
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,160
you'd like

387
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,079
and here's another really useful tip

388
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,160
this is something i just realized myself

389
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
a few weeks ago if you want to use the

390
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,600
in-game

391
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
chat the easiest way for you to do that

392
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,720
is to hit the

393
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
enter key and that will pop you down to

394
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
the chat and then you can type a chat

395
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,399
message hit enter and it will send it

396
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,320
now if you start typing again it's not

397
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
going to be inside that

398
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,839
chat screen anymore instead you have to

399
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,360
hit enter again

400
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
and that will pop you back down into the

401
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,680
chat this makes chat so much more usable

402
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
just hit enter and boom you're ready to

403
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,680
chat

404
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
hit enter again and it sends it hit

405
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,959
enter again and now you're ready to chat

406
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,760
some more

407
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,639
cool let's talk about the characters and

408
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,519
your badge

409
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,040
here you can see my character i go by

410
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,720
the handle reel ed scotus

411
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,959
and in the middle of each character this

412
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,320
year we have a badge

413
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
because you're there at kringlecon 3

414
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,399
french hens so that's your badge for the

415
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,519
conference

416
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,200
if you click on that badge it looks like

417
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
a snowflake if you click on that badge

418
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,160
you will

419
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,959
see that the badge has various elements

420
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,360
in it

421
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,600
it has the narrative this is the story

422
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,639
that unfolds

423
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,079
as you work your way through the

424
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
conference and as you start solving

425
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,399
challenges

426
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,680
you might want to read that narrative

427
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
it's kind of whimsical there's also the

428
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,880
objectives in there

429
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,399
so when you first get into the

430
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,680
environment you'll be given a set of

431
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,399
objectives

432
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,959
and as you solve those objectives

433
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,440
additional objectives may appear

434
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
also you gather hints remember i told

435
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,279
you you get hints by helping elves solve

436
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
their terminal challenges

437
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
those hints will appear in your badge so

438
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,399
you can refer back to them at any time

439
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,160
there's also links to all the great

440
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
talks at

441
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
kringlecon3 there's items in there the

442
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,600
items one is really important

443
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
because as you walk around santa's

444
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,279
castle you'll find different items

445
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,160
laying around

446
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
you just walk right over them and

447
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
they'll be picked up and placed into

448
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,000
your badge

449
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,480
so you now have these items that you can

450
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
then use to help

451
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,240
solve future challenges also you can get

452
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
at your settings via your badge so you

453
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
can change your audio settings and so

454
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,240
forth

455
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,680
now these elves you can see on the right

456
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,360
hand side of the screen here these elves

457
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,000
are placed

458
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,480
all over santa's castle here you can see

459
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
shinny up a tree

460
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,839
and the elves usually will have an

461
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,079
associated

462
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,920
terminal with them here you can see a

463
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
cranberry pie terminal on shinny's

464
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
left hand side if you click on that

465
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,279
you'll

466
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,519
get to help shinny solve some technical

467
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,720
problem that

468
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,680
that elf has in that terminal once

469
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,000
you've

470
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
solved that problem in the cranberry pi

471
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,199
terminal

472
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
that elf will give you hints about how

473
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,399
to solve the

474
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
objective and those objectives are

475
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
usually located near the same elf

476
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,560
so here you can see investigate s3

477
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
bucket right next to shiny upper tree so

478
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,079
you can click right on that

479
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
so as you work your way through this

480
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
check your badge periodically

481
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,720
because you will achieve various things

482
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,760
in the game

483
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
the narrative will expand you'll see

484
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,279
objectives appear

485
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
your hints will grow more populated

486
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
you'll gather various items and of

487
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,000
course you can always watch the talks

488
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
so the characters in your badge if you

489
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
look at the objectives i want to zoom

490
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,639
in on that one right now you'll see that

491
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,440
each of them

492
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
is numbered here we can see point of

493
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
sale password recovery

494
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
we give you an estimate of the

495
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,079
difficulty this one has only one

496
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,760
christmas tree lit up so it's probably

497
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,480
pretty easy

498
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,079
the ones with four or five christmas

499
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,920
trees are much more complex

500
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,160
we'll ask you a question you can then

501
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,839
try to solve that question by

502
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,800
interacting with

503
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,680
the given elf that's associated with it

504
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,199
and then you can submit your answers

505
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,920
right inside your badge but do keep an

506
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,320
eye on the hints in your badge

507
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
now terminal challenges that's the one

508
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
with the cranberry pi terminal they're

509
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,920
all designed to be solved within a

510
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
reasonable amount of time

511
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,040
just using the terminal in your browser

512
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,199
itself most terminal challenges can be

513
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
solved in five minutes up to maybe

514
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
15 minutes or more but not a lot more

515
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
whereas the objectives some of the

516
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
objectives might require

517
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,440
quite a bit of time many of the

518
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,800
objectives you have to download some

519
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,880
additional assets or engage

520
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
in a more rich and complex user

521
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,560
experience

522
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
so um the the terminal challenges are

523
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,639
almost kind of like this easy little

524
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
uh idea popcorn kind of stuff stuff to

525
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
have fun with right in your browser

526
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,120
whereas the objectives they're the more

527
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
longer term

528
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,279
more deeply analytical elements for you

529
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,759
to solve as you work your way through

530
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,880
and remember there's hints there's

531
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,800
plenty hints from the elves oh another

532
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
thing that we added this year

533
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
health status and then we've got a

534
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
facility for reporting bugs

535
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,759
so if you go to status2020.com

536
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,399
you can see the health of various

537
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
elements within the holiday hack

538
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,519
challenge universe

539
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
so that'll give you an idea of what's up

540
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
or heaven forbid if something comes down

541
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,519
you'll be able to see that with a red x

542
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,720
so you might be working on a challenge

543
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
and you'll say wait

544
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,959
something doesn't seem right here i

545
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,720
can't get to the server anymore is it

546
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,959
down for me or is it down for everybody

547
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
you can now simply go to status 2020 and

548
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,160
then look and say oh that one's down

549
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,720
we also have a git repository so that

550
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,399
you can file bug reports we've actually

551
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,759
done this the last couple of years but

552
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,040
we're doing it again this year

553
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
you just go to github.com counter hack

554
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,519
go to holiday hack 2020 and if you

555
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
notice a bug in the game or have some

556
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,959
issue in there you can simply report it

557
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,640
there and the whole team will see it

558
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,240
we have a whole team of elves that are

559
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,839
