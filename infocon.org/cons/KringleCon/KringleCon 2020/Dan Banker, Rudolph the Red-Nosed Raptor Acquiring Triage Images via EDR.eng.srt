they're chasing the elves around they've

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,639

and welcome to rudolph the red-nosed

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,039
raptor acquiring triage images via edr

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,439
i am the cyber elf team lead at motorola

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
solutions my team does about half ir and

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
about half threat hunting

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
you can follow me on twitter at cyber

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,079
shredder

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
who am i i am into metal i'm into guitar

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
i'm into iracing which is sort of this

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,280
hyper realistic racing sim uh you can

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
race online against people from across

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,079
the world

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
if you get into this i'll warn you don't

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,920
bother racing anybody from finland

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,160
because you will lose uh

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,399
when i have spare time i'm into infosec

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,559
i have over a year in the industry

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,680
i've got more than one sanserts nobody

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,960
cares about that though right

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
uh the cli is better than the gui and i

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,640
will die

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,600
on this hill now quick rant i don't know

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
if you follow ian coldwater

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,680
on twitter but she does lots of cool

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,360
stuff in the kubernetes

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,080
container security space and here is

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,159
somebody trying to mansplain her

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,439
a cve that she co-authored guys we need

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
to do better than this

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,520
our industry cannot fill the positions

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,040
that we have available and

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
that means we need women the problem is

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
when women try to join our boys club

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,320
we mansplain them we keep them and

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,280
that's when we're not

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
being outright misogynistic this needs

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,240
to change

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,880
so what's velociraptor well it's a

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
unique advanced open source endpoint

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
monitoring digital forensic and cyber

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
response platform

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,880
uh among other things it collects and

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
that exports artifacts

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,439
uh you can use it to hunt for bad guys

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
in your network

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,680
now when i was taking forensics 508

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,239
which i highly recommend great class

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,239
they mentioned that you can use it to

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
create an executable

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,520
now this gave me an idea

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
if you've seen any of my other talks you

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
may have seen me talk about

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
carbon black response and threat hunter

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
just about any edr product has some sort

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
of live response capability

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
essentially that's a shell that you can

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
open up on any of your endpoints that

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
has a sensor on it you can do things

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,239
like

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
run processes kill processes uh collect

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
ram

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
collect files uh do things like that

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
which is a great la incident response

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
capability to have so this gave me the

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
idea can we use this to obtain a triage

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
image

76
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
now if you're not heavy into forensics a

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,640
triage image

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,440
is just the good stuff it's going to be

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,000
things like

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
registry hives windows event logs uh

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
browser history stuff like that

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
this is a much smaller uh

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
much smaller amount of data that you're

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
pulling back from

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
your host saves you from having to

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,480
capture

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,680
the entire image but it should be enough

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,959
to give you some idea if there's

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
something hinky going on in the system

90
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
so what i'm going to show you i'm going

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
to show you in carbon black

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
because that's what i'm familiar with

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,519
but

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,920
you can do this with any product that

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
you can upload and download files to a

96
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,799
remote host

97
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
and run processes on the remote host i'm

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,159
not sure if you can do this with

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,000
something like bigfix i haven't tried it

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
so what we're going to do first is start

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,560
our velociraptor server

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
essentially you need to download an

103
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
executable and

104
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
install it then you're going to generate

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,879
a config create a user

106
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
admin user probably then you're going to

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,720
start the server it's going to listen on

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
localhost 88.89

109
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,159
so you can do everything that we're

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,159
going to see here from a browser

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,760
i got to give a shout out the

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,399
documentation is great it's step by step

113
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,000
i always am a fan of that

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
so we're going to go to the server

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
artifacts page and click on what i think

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
is a paper airplane right here i don't

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,040
know

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
so search for cape with a k and then

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,400
select

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,880
windows dot cape files dot targets and

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,440
select

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
add then you're going to scroll down

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
where it says

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,520
configure parameters here on the right

125
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
and check the box that you want

126
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
now basic collection and sans triage are

127
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,960
great starting points

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
they'll get most of the good stuff but

129
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
you can add

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720
or take away things that you're

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
interested in or not interested in

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
so now we've created a shiny new

133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
collector

134
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
go to the uploaded files tab that's

135
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,000
still on the same

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
same page as we were just on and

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,400
download the collector

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,759
okay so now we're going to deploy the

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,479
collector in carbon black live response

140
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,240
the way we're going to do this is to

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,840
start up a live response

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
session uh connect to the host and use

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,840
the put command

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
a quick opsec note desktop is not a

145
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
great destination

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,120
you don't want to do this anywhere that

147
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
your users can see the files being

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
created

149
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
now we're going to use exec to run the

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
executable give it about 15 minutes

151
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,039
that's all it should need to

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,000
do what it's going to do then we've got

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
a series of output files

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
so in the same directory that you ran

155
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
velociraptor from

156
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,360
it's going to create an html report a

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
zip file and a log

158
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
the zip file is going to contain your

159
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,120
artifacts your registry your event logs

160
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
your browser history

161
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,039
whatever you told it to collect and your

162
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,639
artifact locations are going to be the

163
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,919
same as on the disk

164
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,600
so if you're looking for something in

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
windows system 32 slash config

166
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,759
it's going to be in that same folder

167
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,280
tree under the c

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,479
folder in that zip file should be about

169
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,720
500 megabytes or so depending on what

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
you've told it to collect

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,600
so now you can find the bad stuff this

172
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
is the html report

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
so you can see it's collected some

174
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
cookies here chrome extensions which as

175
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,039
we all know can be

176
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,840
malicious and browser history which you

177
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,199
know if you're looking for

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,960
a user who's spending all day on

179
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
facebook there it is right there

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
whatever you collected is going to be in

181
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
this report so it's sort of a duplicate

182
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,080
of running

183
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
whatever tools you're in you like on

184
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
these artifacts

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
a couple of caveats here it doesn't

186
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
always work

187
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
i haven't been able to figure out why i

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
haven't had the uh

189
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,160
the time to run this down sometimes uh i

190
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
give it enough time to run i check that

191
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,160
the process that i started is not still

192
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,880
running

193
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
so velociraptor is done but the output

194
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,120
files are empty

195
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,639
i'm not sure why it doesn't seem to have

196
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,560
anything to do with

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
the operating system also if you're

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
doing something that is discoverable in

199
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,160
court

200
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,919
you need to know that the file

201
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
timestamps are going to be

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,080
changed so what you're doing is copying

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,199
all these files from

204
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,160
one location to another location so

205
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
things like

206
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
last modified time are going to be

207
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,440
different

208
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
the times within like registry hive

209
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
should still be good

210
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,880
but if you're doing something that's

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
discoverable in court it's probably best

212
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,560
to

213
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
just grab the whole image this is great

214
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,759
for trying to find malware

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,319
or to get some idea if there's something

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
worth looking at

217
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,039
if you've seen any of my other talks you

218
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,199
know that i like to automate things

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
and it so happened that just after i

220
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
figured out how to

221
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
make velociraptor work we had an

222
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
incident where we needed to grab about

223
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
20 triage images

224
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
would have been super cool to be able to

225
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,919
automate this uh

226
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,960
however we hadn't had time to do it yet

227
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
uh unfortunately being a global company

228
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,000
if

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,319
our users are in like apac or something

230
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,039
like that

231
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
somebody has to stay up all night to

232
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
find the host online luckily i have

233
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
minions this wasn't me that had to do it

234
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,599
but i still

235
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,759
uh want to be able to automate this

236
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,160
luckily carbon black has a great api

237
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,199
almost anything that you can do in

238
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
the gui you can also do through the api

239
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
so we're going to be working on this one

240
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,958
of the things like for example we'd

241
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,200
start a job to check every 5 or 10

242
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,279
minutes to see if the host is online

243
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
when it finds it online then it starts

244
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,719
to upload the file

245
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
run it and then grab all the artifacts

246
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
also we want to be able to integrate

247
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
this with our ticketing platform so we

248
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,920
can just have

249
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
analysts press a button and then have it

250
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,320
be done

251
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,640
thank you so much for watching i hope

252
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,399
that you found this interesting

253
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,200
uh hit me up on twitter thanks and have

254
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,240
a great christmas
