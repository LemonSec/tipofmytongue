00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,520
hello

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,440
i'm courtney petabyte professor of

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,600
blockchain technology here at elf

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,880
university

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
as a part of the university's assessing

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,120
and evaluating human behavior for

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,200
naughty and niceness curriculum

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,359
we're going to be talking today about

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,960
blockchain technology

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,920
and how it fits into the broader naughty

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,720
nice list

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
infrastructure here at the north pole we

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,480
take the integrity of the data on the

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,000
naughty nice list

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,558
very seriously we've been tracking the

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,480
naughty nice list digitally since back

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,239
in the 1930s

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,480
and when santa developed blockchain

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,719
technology back in the 1960s

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,440
we converted the naughty nice list over

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,000
to using that technology

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
like a lot of north pole tech

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,360
blockchains have leaked to the general

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,480
public

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
and now they're beginning to understand

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,399
the benefits and usefulness of

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,600
blockchains

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
in this case leaked is probably a

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,199
misnomer

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
we all remember that night back in 2008

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,239
when santa ate a few too many cookies

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,879
and

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,760
in the throes of the sugar rush rattled

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,400
off that

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
white paper under a pseudonym and sent

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,479
it out into the world causing

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,600
quite a stir

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
what is a blockchain a blockchain is

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
just a method of storing digital

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,920
information

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
blockchains provide data integrity

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
by storing information in a way that

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,320
ensures that if

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
any portion of that data is altered

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,880
or changed or removed tampering

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,240
will be obvious while blockchains are

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,600
used as part of a cryptocurrency

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,119
uh technology because you know who in

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,640
his white paper

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
they represent a completely separate

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,399
technology

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,399
individual data records are called

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,479
blocks and they're linked together

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,439
one after another that's how we get the

55
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:57,840
name

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
blockchain

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,759
how does a blockchain provide data

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,960
integrity it's

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,840
actually very simple in addition to its

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,878
own data

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,680
each block in the blockchain also stores

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
a cryptographic hash of

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,720
all of the data in the previous block

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
if any chain is made change is made to

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
any block in the blockchain

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
it'll be immediately obvious because the

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
cryptographic hash

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
stored in the following block will be

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,959
wrong and the cryptographic hashes

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,519
in every block following the change

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,360
block will be wrong

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
this ensures that once we've added data

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,959
to the blockchain

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
it can't be altered or removed without

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,400
that change being evident

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,280
this is why we have chosen to store

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
naughty nice list

78
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,840
information in a blockchain

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
keeping track of the naughty and

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,400
niceness of 7.8 billion humans and

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
magical beings

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,200
is a difficult difficult task

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,519
every one of those beings is tracked 24

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,239
hours a day

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
seven days a week 365 days a year by our

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,319
fleet

87
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
of elves on the shelves who report

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
naughty and nice activity

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
back to our data center here at the

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
north pole

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,200
we've calculated that on average each

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
tracked individual

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,280
will perform some sort of action that

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
will rise to the level where it needs to

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
be recorded on the naughty nice list

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,959
approximately 2.1 times per week

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
if you do the math this works out to be

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,640
over 27

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
000 new blocks per second

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
because that would be an enormous load

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,440
for a single system

102
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,560
to try to handle we have actually broken

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,200
up

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,680
the block chains into 1 000 different

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,560
block chains with each individual

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,040
assigned to one of those different block

107
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,519
chains

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
in addition to protecting the integrity

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
of the data

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,640
using blockchain technology we've also

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,519
used

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,080
a santus our santa signature system

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
no block can be added to the official

114
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,000
naughty nice blockchain unless the data

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,480
has been

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
signed with a digital signature from our

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,320
high-speed

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,600
santa signature system the s3 is our

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,000
most

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
secure system here at the north pole you

121
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
cannot access that system

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,680
individually it requires three separate

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
people to access the system

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
each one providing both a password and

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,960
a hardware token the s3 system will

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,000
digitally sign

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
a hash of the data portion including the

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
previous hash

129
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,560
of every block that is assigned and

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
added to one of the official chains

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
how are you supposed to document an

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,440
incident

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
well each block represents an individual

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
incident that rises to the level of

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
altering someone's naughty nice score

136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
field operatives are expected to provide

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
some sort of documentation

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,479
of the incident and that's usually in

139
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,240
the form of a report

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
a photo or other background information

141
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
blockchain blocks are designed so that

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,720
you can add up to

143
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
nine separate documents of various

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
formats

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,600
and those will be attached to each block

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,320
we allow

147
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
a wide range of formats as you can see

148
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,600
here

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,759
on the screen relative documentation

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,639
that doesn't match a supported format

151
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,600
can be added just

152
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,800
simply as a binary blob just so that you

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,199
know

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
most of our operatives work with simple

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
pdf documents

156
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,759
attaching each one to a single block in

157
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,840
the blockchain

158
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,000
well what does a naughty nice block look

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
like

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
well the naughty nice block contains two

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,720
different kinds of information

162
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
as shown on the screen here the red

163
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
information is user input this is

164
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,319
information that you

165
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,039
will be adding once you've graduated

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,520
from

167
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,800
elf university's curriculum

168
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,039
the blue information is added by the

169
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,840
blockchain

170
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
code each block consists of an index

171
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
which is the number of the block on the

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,759
blockchain

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
a nonce which is a 64-bit value randomly

174
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,080
generated by

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
our blockchain code and added to the

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,479
block

177
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,800
and we'll explain the reason for this in

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
the coming slides

179
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
the information that you will be adding

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,440
are the id number of the naughty nice

181
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,479
individual

182
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,600
your personal uh uh id number as the

183
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
reporting party

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
you'll tell us how many documents you'll

185
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
be adding to the block

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
you'll tell us the score of the naughty

187
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,240
nice points

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
assessed whether it was a naughty action

189
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
a nice action

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,479
and then you'll provide the documents

191
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
the blockchain code will add the date

192
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,120
and time

193
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
it will add the hash of the previous

194
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,319
block

195
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,960
and it will then send it off to the s3

196
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,599
system

197
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
to be digitally signed once it's

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,960
returned

199
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,599
the full block hash will be taken and

200
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,000
that will be used as the previous hash

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
in the following block

202
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
how do we validate that the blockchain

203
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
has not been altered it's actually very

204
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,400
simple

205
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
to ensure the data on the blockchain has

206
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
not been altered we begin at the first

207
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,520
block

208
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,960
known as the genesis block it is assumed

209
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
to be

210
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
valid just simply by being defined as

211
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,520
the genesis block

212
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,400
from there we begin by checking the

213
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
hashes

214
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,039
of the block and the digital signatures

215
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,039
of the block and we check to make sure

216
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,199
that the hash matches

217
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,240
the previous block hash of the following

218
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
block

219
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,319
if at any time any of those are

220
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,720
incorrect all of the following blocks

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
will be incorrect as well

222
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,479
and we know that we've found an invalid

223
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,840
block on the blockchain

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,840
we're in the midst of a two-year

225
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,039
modernization

226
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,720
project for our blockchain technology

227
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
here at the north pole

228
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
we've been using blockchain since the

229
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,319
technology was developed by santa back

230
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,520
in the mid 60s

231
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
and quite honestly our code base is

232
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,120
getting a little old

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,599
most of it has been written in cobol up

234
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,879
until this year

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
we're currently in year one of a

236
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,479
two-year program to overhaul

237
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,280
our technology based on the suggestions

238
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,958
of rit consulting firm

239
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,559
jf consulting we've moved our code base

240
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,240
to python

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
you may have noticed that we talked a

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,599
lot about cryptographic

243
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,640
hashes and well uh unfortunately

244
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
due to some unforeseen delays we were

245
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,680
unable to deploy

246
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,160
our new python code until after the

247
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,640
beginning of 2020 when we already had

248
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
blocks in the blockchain

249
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,200
our previous blockchain code used md5

250
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
hashes and we know

251
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,839
that md5 hashes have some potential

252
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,240
issues

253
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,279
luckily uh several years ago we began

254
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,279
adding a 64-bit random nonce to

255
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,720
each of the blockchain blocks that was

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,200
what i described as the nonce when we

257
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
look at the contents of a blockchain

258
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
block

259
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,399
those 64-bit nonces are added to the

260
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,160
beginning of the block in order

261
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,200
to keep us from having any

262
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
issues surrounding md5

263
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
we're ready to plug to deploy patching

264
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
uh to switch over to sha 256

265
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,600
hashes once we begin our rollout

266
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,120
of 2021's blockchain

267
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
thank you very much for attending

268
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,920
today's lecture on blockchain technology

269
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
should you have any questions i have

270
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,040
