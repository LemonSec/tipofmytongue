1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,000
ho ho ho

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,560
i just got done talking with santa and

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,040
he

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,599
thinks it would be a great idea if you

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,800
were to give yourself

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
a blog for christmas or this could be

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
a talk that is why i t security

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
uh people need blogs and i think you

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
should all have blogs that you're

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,640
writing

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,359
um here's the reasons why so i'm jack

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,400
resider

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,119
i was a network security engineer for 10

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,160
years

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,479
um i was configuring firewalls

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,040
troubleshooting them ids's ips's

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,239
syslogs you know you name it but then

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,040
i uh started a blog and then i became a

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,920
podcaster

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,440
and at this point i have four different

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
blogs and i think blogs are great

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
and i'll try to convince you to get your

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,520
own blog

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
my first blog was written in 2010 and i

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,199
had some reasons

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,520
why i decided to blog first i wanted to

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,680
remember the problems that i was how to

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,359
solve problems i was solving in the past

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,079
like

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
i would um configure something and i

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,479
would have a configuration that i would

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,119
apply

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
or i would type in a command that had

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,200
some weird you know dashes and

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,280
weird switches at the end i couldn't

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
remember what those things were

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
how did i do that i totally forgot i

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,799
tried looking at my notebooks

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,920
tried looking at emails couldn't

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
remember i don't remember so

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,360
where was i putting that stuff i wasn't

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,040
putting it anywhere and you know

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
that's not a good idea people were

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,200
asking me for help all the time hey

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,479
you're good at troubleshooting this you

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
go to troubleshooting that come on over

47
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
to my desk yeah help me out with this

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,400
and that sort of thing

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,079
and um you know i'd have to write

50
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,680
full-on emails like here's how to

51
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,960
troubleshoot this and here's what the

52
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
backup plan is and the strategies and

53
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
all these things

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,680
um and send them out and i was doing

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
that over and over and over and over

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,000
i was getting pretty repetitive i

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,159
realized my impact was limited

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,240
on what i was doing on the world right

59
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
so the only people who i i thought i was

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,200
a good

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
network security engineer but the only

62
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
people who could even vouch for me or a

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,640
test

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,200
for me were my co-workers and my

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,479
customers

66
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
these are the only people who knew i

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,318
existed as a network security engineer

68
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:08,959
like

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,160
i was valuable to them but nobody else

70
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,000
on the planet knew who i was or

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
you know if i was good or not and so

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
that was okay but if i were to ever

73
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
leave that job now i gotta start at

74
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,599
square one

75
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,360
where i have to build my reputation all

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
the way from scratch once again

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,720
and that is a big task right so

78
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,879
how can i impact more people with the

79
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,319
knowledge i have

80
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,920
and another thing was that i would

81
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
sometimes face problems that nobody knew

82
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,599
the answer to and they were winging it

83
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,400
and they were given

84
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
wrong solutions and not very helpful at

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,560
all

86
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
um or you know i was you know googling

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,800
an error code and there would be no

88
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
answers for that on google like

89
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
basically

90
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,680
that error code has never been seen on

91
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,879
the internet ever before and i'm like

92
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,239
how is this possible

93
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,800
and so when you're when you're seeing

94
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
lots of wrong information or seeing no

95
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
information at all on a problem

96
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
you got to go off the map and solve it

97
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
on your own

98
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
and figure it out and when you figured

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,159
out

100
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,920
maybe you can like help the internet

101
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
right like look somebody else has got to

102
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
have this error code

103
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
what did why don't i blog about it just

104
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,800
like show people

105
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
how to do it and lastly this is a weird

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,319
one but

107
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,519
it's so true um i in 2010 i was dating

108
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,400
at the time

109
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,480
and i didn't have a website or blog or

110
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,519
anything and

111
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,120
this woman i was dating was not an i.t

112
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,920
tech person at all like she didn't even

113
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,799
care for it

114
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
at all or couldn't figure out much of it

115
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,319
yet she had

116
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,720
a website that she put together somehow

117
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,239
i have no idea how

118
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
and it was popular it was like getting

119
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
talked about on social media and stuff

120
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
and i'm just like

121
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,680
how is it that you have a bigger web

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,080
presence

123
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,239
than me and i've spent the last 20 years

124
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,239
of my life in front of this computer

125
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,680
learning how to build websites and

126
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
coding and breaking breaking things and

127
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
fixing things

128
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,720
and yet you have somehow gotten more

129
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
stuff out on the internet than i have

130
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,760
this is ridiculous i definitely need to

131
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,080
represent myself properly online

132
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,799
by having a website at least and a blog

133
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,200
is a

134
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
ver a great first website to make

135
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
because it's easy to make

136
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,239
it's got a low barrier of entry and

137
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,279
you you can be very valuable but what do

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,320
you write on it well

139
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
obviously those obscure commands that i

140
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
would rarely use but how would the look

141
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,079
up

142
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,280
i have to look it up every time i want

143
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
to use it like the find command on linux

144
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
for some reason i can never remember

145
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,280
what it looks like

146
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,160
or how to take a screenshot on mac os

147
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
what are these

148
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
magic buttons right so i'd look this up

149
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,880
every time

150
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
might as well put it on my blog so it's

151
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,040
easy for me to find i don't have to like

152
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
click around on a few websites to figure

153
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
out exactly what it is i'm looking for i

154
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
know i've done this command before

155
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
it's on my blog go there real quick done

156
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
i've got the answer

157
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
um how to shoot troubleshoot problems i

158
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
face regularly

159
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
but you know if i'm hitting that same

160
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
problem over and over and i'm not

161
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
documenting how i'm solving it

162
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
i'm starting at square one every time

163
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
and when somebody else needs help

164
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,639
troubleshooting that then

165
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,039
they like where do we go like so if i

166
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
could just troubleshoot this is or

167
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
document how i troubleshot this here's

168
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,840
how i fixed it

169
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
then i can use that again over and over

170
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
as like a guide on how to fix it in the

171
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,000
future

172
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
especially when you get woken up at like

173
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,039
2 a.m because you're on call and they're

174
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,160
like we've got this problem and you're

175
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
like i have no idea

176
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
who i even am or what my name is at 2am

177
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
much less how to troubleshoot this

178
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
really obscure problem

179
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
so having like a nice documentation on

180
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
how you troubleshot it in the past

181
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
is such a lifesaver um obviously

182
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
problems that google couldn't solve were

183
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,759
great things that i could blog about

184
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,080
see the thing is a lot of people don't

185
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
know what to blog about they think oh

186
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,919
i could blog about the news i could blog

187
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,919
about my observations in the infosec

188
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,720
space

189
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
or you know come up with new innovative

190
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
ideas for the future no

191
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
forget about all that no you're not

192
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
trying to impress anyone

193
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
you're just there to document the

194
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
problems you've solved

195
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,039
and that would be great the world needs

196
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
more of that absolutely more of that

197
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
if i ever took a class which i took lots

198
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
of classes on you know ceh and

199
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,759
and cisco networking and juniper

200
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
networking i was notating all that

201
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,800
right in my blog like that was my note

202
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
keeper was my blog like i was just had

203
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,479
my blog open i was just writing

204
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
how to do this and that in the class

205
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,160
straight onto my blog and it was getting

206
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,120
blogged

207
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
um because that's what i mean how were

208
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,240
you going to keep your notes from the

209
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,919
class you might as well make them public

210
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,639
like you

211
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,240
know you kept them there like it's a

212
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
backup strategy too for your information

213
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
right

214
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
um anytime i had a video i saw a video

215
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
on youtube that i liked that was you

216
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,000
know i t

217
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
security i would comment on it put it on

218
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
the blog

219
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
and sometimes i would get really you

220
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
know into it and start building like

221
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
javascript tools and stuff

222
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
to help me do things like subnet

223
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
calculators

224
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,440
and hash analyzers and stuff and yeah

225
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
that was cool yeah you know i'm just

226
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
building cool things i'm learning coding

227
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,759
like i'm practicing

228
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,120
i.t stuff um any time i left lessons

229
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,960
learned i would blog about like

230
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,759
i learned don't ever use debug all on a

231
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,360
cisco router because it could break the

232
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,400
router right

233
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
so um yeah i mean junior

234
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
junior engineers were asking me what was

235
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,880
some of the things you did wrong you

236
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,520
know

237
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,919
coming up i got a whole blog on all the

238
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
things i did wrong so like uh you know

239
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,759
what where do we want to start

240
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,520
right so that was a good lesson for

241
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
other people as well

242
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
and then um any sort of video lessons

243
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
that i created i would blog about too

244
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
because i'd make a video like here's how

245
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,520
to upgrade this

246
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
firewall or something like that and i

247
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
would post that and then that was a

248
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,479
great place to put it on the blog

249
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,319
so with that a blog was born and i made

250
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
the website tunnelsup.com in 2010

251
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
and yep just had a bunch of articles and

252
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,520
some tools and cheat sheets and things

253
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,479
and what happened

254
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
when i did this well the internet

255
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
corrected me

256
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
that's what's going to happen right and

257
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
that's great if it happens because

258
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
you're trying to be a good engineer

259
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,240
or or a security person or i.t person

260
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,759
and now the internet is saying well you

261
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,720
did that wrong

262
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
uh here's how you could do it better or

263
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,840
something like that that's only going to

264
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,639
make you better

265
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,440
that's going to improve you tremendously

266
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
when somebody comes along and says did

267
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,479
you ever consider using this command

268
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,919
instead this would be a lot easier if

269
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,520
you did it this way or whatever

270
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
and now you can say oh yeah here's why

271
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,520
that's a good idea or here's why that's

272
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
not a good idea and you can have like

273
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
really good conversations about that um

274
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
i actually literally got job offers not

275
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
like full-on come work for a company but

276
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,000
like i'm hitting this problem

277
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,639
i can't figure it out can i hire you for

278
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,680
the weekend

279
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
you know for like four hours like that

280
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
that kind of thing um just like

281
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
be a consultant for me for a couple

282
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,519
hours and let's get on a video sharing

283
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,479
and

284
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,760
you know show me what commands i'm not

285
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,599
getting right so uh

286
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,000
yeah i mean that that happened like

287
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
people did not see my resume they don't

288
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
know who i am

289
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
and yet they're letting me they're

290
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
giving me the option to put hands on

291
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
on their uh you know in in their routers

292
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,440
and firewalls like

293
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,959
whoa how did that happen um strangers

294
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,720
would write to me and just thank me and

295
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,160
that's such a great feeling when you put

296
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
something out there and people

297
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
are like i've looked all over the

298
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
internet i couldn't find the answer you

299
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760

page thank you so much

301
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,800

send me money like five or ten dollars

303

um

339
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,040
you know if i need a job i could just

340
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,480
put it on the blog and say oh i'm

341
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
looking for a job here and there so

342
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,959
like it really getting outside that

343
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,399
immediate circle of who knows that

344
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,120
you're good

345
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
and letting the world know you're good

346
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
can really be it can really open a lot

347
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,920
of doors

348
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,800
and another thing is i use the blog all

349
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
the time because i was referencing it

350
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,160
to troubleshoot certain things and to

351
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
look up commands um so yeah i was like

352
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,399
the biggest user for sure

353
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,839
and that's then that's what kind of goes

354
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,040
back to what do you blog about do you

355
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,440
buy

356
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
do you write like lengthy articles and

357
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
poetry and stuff no man write stuff that

358
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,000
you want to read

359
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
because i'm putting stuff up there that

360
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,040
i'm like going back to and like oh yeah

361
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,680
what was that

362
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
what was that error code that um you

363
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,040
know what does that mean that erica i

364
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,360
know

365
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
i blogged about that so let me go there

366
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
and see um

367
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
and you could like kind of eject stuff

368
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,600
out of your head and say i don't have to

369
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,360
memorize what that error code is i have

370
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
i have the website right here that i can

371
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
go to anytime so um

372
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,160
another thing is is because co-workers

373
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
stopped asking me as many questions

374
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,160
right

375
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
hey jack can you come to help me

376
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,480
troubleshoot this i've seen you

377
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
troubleshoot this before you know all

378
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,560
about this

379
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
forget it uh here's a link or i'll type

380
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,399
up how to troubleshoot it

381
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,920
and instead of sending them the email on

382
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,440
how to troubleshoot it i would just blog

383
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,760
it

384
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
and then say here's a link to my blog

385
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,120
read about it there if you have problems

386
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
i'll be happy to come over and help

387
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
right and so now they were learning

388
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,399
oh i'll just check the blog first see if

389
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,240
he's hit this problem before

390
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
and if not i'll ask him about it right

391
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,480
so um they were actually asking me less

392
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,079
because they were looking at my blog

393
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,399
first it was incredible

394
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,720
so what's so hopefully this has

395
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,079
convinced you you're ready to start a

396
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:44,640
blog

397
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,680
let's get a new one new year starting

398
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,680
2021 start it out with a blog

399
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,839
here's some of the blog options for

400
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,880
2021.

401
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
wordpress is still pretty popular um

402
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
it's really user

403
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,480
friendly however uh it runs php which

404
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,399
can be pros and cons like so

405
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,000
the pros are like you have access to

406
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
this amazing backend that you can

407
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
configure to do all kinds of cool things

408
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,560
and

409
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,079
and you know it's cool but you can build

410
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,480
extra tools and stuff however php is

411
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,160
riddled with vulnerabilities and so you

412
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,880
need to keep it

413
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
updated and then the same thing with

414
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
wordpress you need to keep it updated

415
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,519
because it has vulnerabilities

416
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
and all the plugins that wordpress has

417
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,800
have vulnerabilities so you need to

418
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
update the plugins too

419
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
so there's just a lot of updates that

420
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,200
have to go on on wordpress

421
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
you could self-host it or you can have

422
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
them host it for you

423
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
but yeah those are kind of the pros and

424
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,760
cons i prefer jekyll and ghost right now

425
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,800
these are static html website generators

426
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,639
what that means is that i kind of have

427
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
the cms the content management

428
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,760
system on my computer and it has the

429
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,399
ruby

430
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,959
and it has the python to render to take

431
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,000
these uh

432
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,399
this blog and to turn it into static

433
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,680
html so it kind of

434
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
compiles it and renders it to just be at

435
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
the end of the day

436
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
html css and javascript and that is

437
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,959
that's it it has no back end and so when

438
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,519
i when i upload it i can send it to just

439
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,200
anything that can host a file

440
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
so it can be an aws s3 server it can be

441
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
a github page

442
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,399
and if you don't know you know github is

443
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,839
a place to store files

444
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,320
but github pages is a place to display

445
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,079
that in like a website

446
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
view but github doesn't have a back end

447
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
you can't configure

448
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,639
php or something to you know control

449
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,839
your website from

450
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,079
from github pages and same with aws it

451
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,120
just hosts

452
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
static pages and so that's a perfect

453
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,560
combination for

454
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,279
for jekyll or ghost to then to then go

455
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,160
up to uh

456
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,880
you know one of those places medium.com

457
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,240
is a place to blog

458
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,000
um this is probably the easiest to get

459
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
started you just create an account and

460
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,120
go there's no picking a theme

461
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
or configuring anything you're just like

462
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
this is what you get

463
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
and you you can't really like advertise

464
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,639
on it or or you know put

465
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,000
google ads or anything in there if

466
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,360
that's what you want to do too because

467
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,639
uh they've kind of

468
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
they've got it pretty locked down so um

469
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,320
yeah it's it's not really customizable

470
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,920
but it's simple to get started and wix

471
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,360
and squarespace are just kind of a step

472
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,560
above that where

473
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,720
you can totally customize it you can

474
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,920
change the way the

475
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,480
theme looks or the font or you move and

476
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,199
drag and drop

477
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
graphics around it's real simple um

478
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,199
and you can use it as a blog too so um

479
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,040
hopefully that's inspired you to like go

480
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
get a blog started make give yourself a

481
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
blog for christmas

482
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,839
i think it would be a great um thing for

483
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,680
you to do and i would love to see it so

484
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,519
if you do make a blog from this video

485
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,279
please show it to me i can't wait to see

486
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,639
what you've made um

487
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,120
and honestly the thing is that i blogged

488
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
for seven years

489
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,399
and then i started to make a podcast and

490
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,760
i don't think i would have had the

491
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,959
confidence

492
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,839
or the ability to do it if i wasn't

493
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,120
blogging first

494
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,560
because i'm putting stuff out there in

495
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,240
the world and i'm nervous what the world

496
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,360
is going to think of it right as a

497
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,320
blogger

498
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,399
and after a while you just get used to

499
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,360
it like oh yeah

500
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,199
people are throwing rocks that's fine

501
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
i'm used to it this is valid this is not

502
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,839
valid and you're explaining things

503
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
you know complex topics and you're just

504
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,199
going through the motions over and over

505
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:05,839
and over

506
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,160
and you get good at presenting and

507
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,120
teaching

508
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,079
and it wasn't if i didn't have all that

509
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,279
seven years of blogging

510
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,959
i don't think my podcast would be

511
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,959
popular as popular it is

512
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,519
because it just that was a skill that i

513
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,480
kind of needed to

514
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,120
skill up on before i could do it so i'm

515
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,320
not saying go create a podcast

516
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,199
afterwards

517
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
but i'm just saying the doors have

518
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,680
opened in so many new ways and now i'm a

519
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
full-time podcaster

520
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
podcasting about cyber security so and

521
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,279
that's a dream

522
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
come true that i can just do that thing

523
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,519
on my own and it's amazing

524
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
so i mean that's possible so yeah i hope

525
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,720
this has been

526
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,399
inspirational to you to go make a blog

527
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,399
and i can't wait to see it

528
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
