1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
welcome kringlecon attendees my name is

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
chris lg and i'm here to talk about the

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,839
can bus

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,519
can can i'm so happy to be back here in

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,280
the north pole uh and talking to you

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,240
folks today

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,320
i work for counter hack challenges uh

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,039
primarily i build uh challenges for

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,880
net wars and the holiday hack i also do

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,320
penetration testing and teach

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,000
penetration testing with sands

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and on drill weekends i have a very

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,599
serious role in the army national guard

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,279
before i go any farther thank you so

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,279
much santa claus it is wonderful that

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,640
you keep putting this conference on this

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:32,880
is

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
this is the og virtual conference right

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,320
we're all just so glad we can keep

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,440
traveling here

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
through our browsers i also want to

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,680
thank alan kane and jonathan burnham

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
these two gentlemen work for toyota

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,039
securing

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,120
and analyzing these these canned systems

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,600
and making them safer for all of us

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
when my work goes wrong someone gets a

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,440
bad pen test or or someone's challenge

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,000
breaks

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
when their work goes wrong a car can go

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,879
off the road so thank you guys for

32
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,920
having that very

33
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,280
important job and for sharing your

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
knowledge with me about the can bus

35
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,559
so the the can bus itself or controller

36
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,680
area network

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
is it feels a lot like

38
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
raw hardware to me because it pretty

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
much is raw hardware right this is

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,840
something that's been around for a

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,119
couple of decades now

42
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
uh this obd2 port that we're going to

43
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,159
talk about in a minute here

44
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,680
that's been standard on vehicles in

45
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
north america for over 20 years and

46
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
almost as long

47
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,159
in europe in different parts of the

48
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,479
world and

49
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,920
it's just a very simple basic

50
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
network where one device has has

51
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,400
information to put out it puts it on the

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
bus and then if another device needs

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,360
that message it picks it up

54
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,840
and performs some action really not

55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,280
designed with any security in mind this

56
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
is just how different components of the

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,520
car

58
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,240
talk to each other so for example if we

59
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,040
have our

60
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,119
little key fob here and we push lock and

61
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,880
unlock that's going to blast over the

62
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
radio waves

63
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,759
the key fob receiver is going to get it

64
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
and if it's the right code and whatnot

65
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
it'll go ahead and put some messages

66
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,439
on the canvas so in our example here

67
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,560
let's just say that

68
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
that lock and unlock codes have a can id

69
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,240
of 17

70
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,119
alpha any type of message is going to

71
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,399
have a

72
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,120
can id and that's you know here we're

73
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
going to say the 17 alpha is

74
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,400
is the uh having to do with the locks

75
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,239
lock and lock you might have

76
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
you know 0 8 0 and that's got to do with

77
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
breaks or acceleration or something else

78
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
so each flavor of message gets its own k

79
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,599
id and that's that's

80
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,440
a nice round uh 11 bit number because

81
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
because why not uh and then following

82
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
each candidate you get some data chunk

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
the size of the data chunk will vary

84
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,200
based on the

85
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,360
the type of message it is and and even

86
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
more based on

87
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,160
the dialect of can that the

88
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
manufacturer has chosen to speak in this

89
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
particular vehicle so

90
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,519
it's totally different from to

91
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,599
manufacturer and can be even from model

92
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,560
to model but

93
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
in our example here let's just say that

94
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
locking and unlocking is canid 17a

95
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
and a 0 is a lock and a 0 1 is an unlock

96
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
that's great so that message comes out

97
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,879
of the key fob receiver

98
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
and is going to come out across the bus

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,200
and most devices aren't going to care

100
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
until it gets to something like maybe

101
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,159
the driver door or the passenger door

102
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
and they get that message and go oh

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
unlock you got it and then the the lock

104
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
opens up

105
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,760
now that obd2 port uh because just one

106
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,319
was not

107
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
significant enough we uh we have those

108
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,760
in our vehicles now if you have

109
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,519
something that's that's been built in

110
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
recent memory it has

111
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
let's get a little closer here ah there

112
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,400
we go

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
it has an obd2 port somewhere usually

114
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
right under the the driver's portion of

115
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,599
the dashboard

116
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
uh in in my car it's just left of my my

117
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
knuckle here

118
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
and this is a standard connector even

119
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
though the language spoken behind that

120
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
connector on that bus varies so much

121
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
from vehicle to vehicle

122
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,720
the connector is the same so anybody

123
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
any dealer or mechanic can connect to it

124
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,159
and as long as the device they're

125
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,280
connecting with speaks the right

126
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,000
language

127
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
they can get information from the

128
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
vehicle so i think the classic uh

129
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,519
quintessential example here is

130
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
my check engine light is on i need more

131
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,959
information then

132
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,239
check my engine so i bring it to the

133
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
mechanic they connect to the port

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
and then they get some extra data off of

135
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
that bus and can

136
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
be more specific oh it is a solenoid or

137
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,480
a sensor

138
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
or some broken component and then we get

139
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,519
that extra information

140
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,720
nowadays the can bus is getting more

141
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,600
complex

142
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
and this is this is good for a lot of

143
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
reasons right i think it's probably a

144
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,560
great idea to have the safety critical

145
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,120
systems

146
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,639
segmented off from the main bus so that

147
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,960
somebody messing with my radio can't

148
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
immediately throw my brakes or rev the

149
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,360
engine up

150
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
probably a good idea right but we do

151
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
still need information to go from one

152
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
segment to another

153
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
in my car for example i can get gas

154
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,479
mileage information from

155
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,040
uh from the screen on my radio so that's

156
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
got to be coming from you know the fuel

157
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,360
system

158
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
and the engine or something from one

159
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
segment to another

160
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
into my into my radio so i can see that

161
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
on screen

162
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
another example of of when

163
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
systems need to talk across these

164
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
different segments would be uh when a

165
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,520
dealer

166
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,880
hooks up their tool and they look just

167
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
like this by the way uh kind of

168
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,120
christmasy i

169
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
appreciate that they connect that up to

170
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
the obd2 port

171
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
and then they can push firmware like

172
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
let's say there's a recall

173
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,680
on the steering system of your of your

174
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
vehicle and they can fix it with a

175
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
software upgrade

176
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,479
great they hook in and then the dealer

177
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,440
connects connects hard to this obd2 port

178
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,360
and then sends messages up through the

179
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
gateway ecu

180
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
and maybe there's some security here

181
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,639
maybe there isn't maybe it's a one byte

182
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,199
key

183
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,520
or an eight byte key that's static or

184
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,639
who knows but there's

185
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
depending on the vehicle there's some

186
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,320
method of getting through that gateway

187
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
getting into the safety critical segment

188
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
and getting down to

189
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
uh that steering section to to overwrite

190
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
that firmware

191
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
so good and bad right like we need to

192
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,919
have that communication but there's also

193
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,960
a potential for

194
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,000
uh for security issues

195
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
now when it comes to looking at the

196
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,280
traffic itself

197
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
it can be a lot right like you can hook

198
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,479
up to your car with some specialized

199
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,080
tools and pull that traffic off and

200
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
analyze it

201
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,319
but i'm i'm a little afraid of breaking

202
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,520
my car at some point

203
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,000
if i mess with it too much so if you

204
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,720
want to

205
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
look at traffic uh on its own without

206
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
any risk to your vehicle

207
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,039
there's a great project here by a zombie

208
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,319
craig called i see

209
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,800
sim by the way zombie craig when the

210
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
medical community has a little bit of

211
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
uh you know free cycles for a new

212
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,319
project i'm pushing for you man okay

213
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,639
zombie cure zombie vaccine that's next

214
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,680
uh hang in there

215
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
so so this project lets you simulate can

216
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
traffic

217
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
you can actually connect a joystick up

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,199
to the computer and

219
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,919
steer left and right uh accelerate the

220
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,360
the fictional vehicle

221
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,199
uh you can hit the brakes throw it

222
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,720
through a blinker and then see

223
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,160
output here in a in a virtual dashboard

224
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
uh so really cool so so we hook it up we

225
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,919
we have it go different ways and we see

226
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,960
the effects of it

227
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
we also if we're running the can dump

228
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,560
tool we can see

229
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,599
raw output and save it to a pcap

230
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
and then open open it in an analyzer

231
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,440
like wireshark

232
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
neat now people who are familiar with

233
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,280
wireshark might look at this and say

234
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
uh there's there's some stuff missing

235
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,720
there man like usually there's extra

236
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
stuff down here in the bottom and it's

237
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
like hey this is what this traffic means

238
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,520
and it's kind of blank right there and

239
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
yeah it is

240
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,000
again the the protocol specifics that i

241
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,120
like to call the dialects

242
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
between the different manufacturers are

243
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,039
different such that wireshark can't just

244
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,080
have a universal translator here to

245
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
to turn it all into human readable

246
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,840
messages so

247
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,680
for the most part when we are analyzing

248
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,919
traffic on the can bus it's a lot of

249
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,120
manual effort

250
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
you might get lucky and find a guide to

251
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,479
your vehicle's

252
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
specific language and you could use that

253
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
to see what's going on or maybe

254
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
maybe learn how to add messages to that

255
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
bus to perform a specific action but

256
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,960
more or less we end up just having to

257
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
pare down the traffic as much as we can

258
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,800
so

259
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
we we we turn the never levels and knobs

260
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
as much as we can and try to figure out

261
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,840
what's connected to what

262
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,759
so that we can uh pare it down to the

263
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,520
stuff that's really important

264
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
i think honestly i think of socks

265
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
working much the same way right they

266
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
have all this information

267
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
and they've got to boil it down to the

268
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,479
part that really matters

269
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,639
so that's that's how this works by the

270
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
way when you're running icsim

271
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
in the in the the module that generates

272
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,800
can traffic

273
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
there is an option to have less noise

274
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,360
do yourself a favor if you start playing

275
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
with this and you want to figure out

276
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,760
what

277
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
commands do what uh what can ids mean

278
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
what

279
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,159
turn it on turn on the less noise option

280
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,599
uh and just start in easy mode okay

281
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,000
so that is it there uh thanks so much

282
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
for listening

283
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
to the talk i'm so happy to have you all

284
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,560
here and listening

285
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,959
i hope it is uh useful to you as you hop

286
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,959
around the castle

287
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
i have a feeling that some elf somewhere

288
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
here needs a hand with something related

289
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,839
so

290
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,760
thanks good luck and enjoy the convo
