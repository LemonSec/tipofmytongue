1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,639
the closing keynote

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
which will be given by sudy hurl from

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,119
google

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,640
who has taken over the android platform

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,359
security team

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
and has done a wonderful job with the

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,920
security features of

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,480
android 11 which some of which

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,199
already can already be seen in the

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,719
current

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,040
beta sudhi

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
i i wish you a very good morning to the

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,640
west coast as well

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,640
and over to you in mountain view

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,600
hello everyone good evening uh good

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,000
morning

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
uh that's the case may be where you are

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
um my name is sudhi herle

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,079
i lead android platform security as rene

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,160
was mentioning

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,120
um and today i will be speaking about uh

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
icebergs and android security privacy

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,798
uh trying to understand information

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
asymmetry

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,000
uh that exists for in the platform and

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
uh

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
our users i was really looking forward

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,119
to being

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,400
in uh in austria for this particular

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
symposium

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,439
and uh sharing a roddler with uh renee

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,600
but

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,919
unfortunately the kovit situation has

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,240
made things very difficult for all of us

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,439
i hope you and your loved ones are safe

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,798
and healthy

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,798
uh with that uh let me get started into

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,799
talking about my favorite topic here

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,799
iceberg number one pre-loaded

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,320
applications um

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,600
as you may know there is a lot of media

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,758
hype media concern around security and

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,798
privacy risk coming from pre-installed

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,399
software

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,920
uh in point of fact privacy

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,119
international sent a note to

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,799
our ceo sundar asking google to take

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,240
action against these exploitative

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,799
pre-installed software and android

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
devices

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
sudhi sorry for interrupting we can't

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:22,480
see your screen share yet

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:25,520
no you cannot determine

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,399
can you see it now we

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
see a screen share but within the screen

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:37,840
sure i see

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,839
you at the moment

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
perfect

59
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
can you see the second one now yes

60
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,160
perfect

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,160
oh sorry

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,239
as i was saying um privacy international

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
center note to google

64
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
sundar pichai asking google to take

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,959
action against these

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,879
pre-loaded exploitative software so

67
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,800
right the question to ask right now is

68
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,480
what really is these pre-loaded

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,519
application and why is it

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,200
so bad well every android device ships

71
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,560
with a lot of pre-loaded applications

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,200
they fall into broadly five categories

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,879
uh mostly from the oem i.e the phone

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,159
manufacturer we call them first party

75
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,399
applications

76
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,000
uh some pre-load applications are from

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
uh system-on-chip vendors

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,159
uh and oftentimes they they have the

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
power to act

80
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,640
on behalf of the android platform ie

81
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,798
they enjoy very high privileges

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,238
the third category is a set of google

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,799
mobile service applications

84
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
which almost every oem includes required

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
by contract

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
this includes google play access to the

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
play store gmail etc

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
and then there are carrier applications

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,640
required by telcos

90
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
typically you need them for provisioning

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,679
new accounts voice over lte

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,280
customer support etc and finally the

93
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,040
last category is third-party

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,799
applications which are none of the

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,000
none of the above but are still

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,920
pre-loaded on a mobile device

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,680
many of these are risky due to the

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,358
permissions they have they're not

99
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
you know pre-loads generally aren't

100
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,120
inherently bad

101
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
what makes them bad is the fact that the

102
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
elevated privileges

103
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
causes um bad things to happen for the

104
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,719
user

105
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,960
how do the oems preload these software

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,759
well they don't just bundle the apk

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,239
uh some oems don't know what happens

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,479
when

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
something is signed with a platform key

110
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,440
and so you know

111
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
they they sign these applications the

112
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,680
platform key and now suddenly

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
these third-party application which was

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,400
not written by the oem

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
now has the power to act on behalf of

116
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,758
the platform

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,759
in other cases these preload

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,160
applications have been pre-granted

119
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,600
extremely large permission and privilege

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,800
surface

121
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,479
let's take a look at some real world

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
numbers

123
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,599
so if you look at android 10 api level

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,720
29

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
and see across a you know variety of

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
oems

127
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
what does the number of uh platforms and

128
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
applications look like

129
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,000
for baseline i'm looking at gsi which is

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,960
the google system image

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
which is the absolute bare minimum

132
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,560
version of

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
android i.e aosp plus google mobile

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
software that's required

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
to run a phone when you compare it

136
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
against that

137
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,719
um it has 53 platform signed

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
applications

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,120
but across the ecosystem almost every

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,720
oem that we benchmarked

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,919
has vastly more platform signed

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
applications

143
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,520
well i just now said that preloads

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,919
aren't necessarily bad what makes them

145
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
bad

146
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,198
is elevated privileges so

147
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,520
i'm going to double click a little bit

148
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,960
on just one particular permission

149
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,599
install packages and if you again

150
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,318
look at the aosp baseline and what's in

151
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,319
gsi

152
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
we only have three packages there with

153
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,600
the install package permission

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
but when you look at it across the

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
ecosystem some of the very large

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,039
outliers

157
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,120
include you know anywhere from 25 to

158
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,080
30 different applications that can

159
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,720
install packages on behalf of the user

160
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,599
so we think this is this is problematic

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,759
because

162
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,680
um users often don't know that these

163
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,080
pre-loaded applications have these

164
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,880
these permissions and therefore they are

165
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
unable to

166
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,440
make sense of you know what their device

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
can or cannot do on their behalf

168
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,520
well the next question is what can we do

169
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,319
to improve the status quo i think renee

170
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,560
in his um in his introductory keynote uh

171
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,400
shared some plans

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,720
we totally support that we encourage the

173
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
university in the research community

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,919
to build a consumer accessible

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,080
transparency database

176
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,599
to catalog these preloads and build a

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,318
risk score chart

178
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,120
across many devices in the oems this is

179
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,000
especially important for consumers

180
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,440
because information asymmetry while we

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,800
in the research community

182
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,280
are fairly well versed in understanding

183
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,199
what consent dialogues mean

184
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,198
what a vpn or a proxy means and what

185
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,240
certain permissions mean

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,240
the average consumer by and large is has

187
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,720
absolutely no idea

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,479
and so it falls to us the research

189
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,319
community to raise the consumer

190
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,000
awareness to this problem

191
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,800
and provide a guided path for consumers

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
to make

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
safe purchase choices you know as an

194
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,759
analogy when i go to buy

195
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,280
you know tires for my car depending on

196
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,440
what type of car i have

197
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,878
and what my road conditions are what i

198
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,919
drive every day

199
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,400
and what my skill level is

200
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
i can pretty much choose a very precise

201
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,960
tire that is z-rated

202
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
um that has this kind of tread depth and

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,120
this kind of grip

204
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,400
and stopping power etc so

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,960
regardless of whether you're a

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,159
sophisticated car driver or not

207
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,479
there is a guided path for consumers

208
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,160
to make the right purchase choice for

209
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,878
their car tires

210
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,800
now analogously we don't have that in

211
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,919
android if a consumer wanted to make a

212
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
purchase choice

213
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,758
for an android device based on their

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,919
security or privacy stance

215
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,319
there is there is no guide that tells

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,400
them what they should be looking for

217
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,599
and i'm really hoping that the research

218
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,120
community

219
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,718
and the consortium that renee is trying

220
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
to build will step

221
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,800
up and uh provide this lighted path for

222
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,279
consumers

223
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,640
and in some sense close the information

224
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,640
asymmetry that exists today

225
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,720
iceberg number two former complexity

226
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,000
well here is a block diagram of a phone

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,800
from a few years ago

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,680
um is if it's not very clear i apologize

229
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,240
it's a very low resolution picture

230
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,079
we commonly think that a phone has uh

231
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,880
one cpu

232
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,600
which is which runs android many of you

233
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,720
know that there is also a modem cpu

234
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,320
um but what most of us seem to in the

235
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,440
back of our back of our mind

236
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
we we know but we tend to ignore it is

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
that there are other

238
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
things that also have quote unquote cpu

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
in them

240
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,440
your bluetooth wi-fi controller your gps

241
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,240
controller

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,480
your lcd controller your usb controller

243
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,080
your dsps that is used for modem your

244
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,839
camera isp

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
all of these are little cpus

246
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,760
yes there are cpus everywhere on a

247
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
modern phone it's not just the ones that

248
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,279
you commonly know

249
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,880
but there are lots and lots and lots of

250
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
them and they all run some kind of

251
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,760
embedded software

252
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,760
typically called firmware and almost

253
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,040
always they are distributed as binary

254
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,880
blobs by

255
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,399
the manufacturer of that particular

256
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,399
component

257
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,160
the interesting thing to ask here is do

258
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,160
we know what's in each of these blobs

259
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
are they regularly updated with security

260
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
fixes

261
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
do they really come from the oem or the

262
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,480
chip vendor

263
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920
did anyone else interfere with them in

264
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,959
the long supply chain from silicon

265
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,079
vendor to oem factory to end user

266
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,760
and also you know uh from a from a

267
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
security practitioner point of view it's

268
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,800
interesting to ask

269
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,439
are these images signed um does these

270
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
those little tiny cpus use verified boot

271
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,160
to check the signature of each of these

272
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,439
firmware blobs

273
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,000
what does this mean to the average

274
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
consumer uh well from the consumer point

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,240
of view

276
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,000
it's useful to us did the system

277
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,560
software on their phone really come

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,760
from the manufacturer is the system

279
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,599
software on their phone

280
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,279
the same as the one checked by google

281
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
did the ota update that they just

282
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,800
received was it

283
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,719
broadly distributed to every user or was

284
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,880
it more narrowly built and targeted to

285
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
some subset of users

286
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,519
these sorts of questions are really

287
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,839
really difficult to answer today

288
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,800
and uh this opacity that exists at the

289
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,040
lower level

290
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,279
um is something that you know i'd like

291
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,839
to call an iceberg and requires

292
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,560
more attention from the research

293
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,560
community

294
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,479
to fix you know what i call another

295
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,160
information asymmetry here

296
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
the practitioners and the manufacturer

297
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,880
of the devices have vastly more

298
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
information

299
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,720
than the consumer whereas the consumer

300
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,040
feels the the impact

301
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,880
of some of these decisions that we

302
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,279
collectively the community make on their

303
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,279
behalf

304
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
finally i get to my last iceberg which

305
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,040
is

306
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,640
security ux we all recognize that

307
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
credentials are our most valuable

308
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,720
digital asset

309
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,600
we use our credentials um everywhere

310
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,040
today

311
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,320
from you know ordering food to groceries

312
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,439
uh banking investment and in many

313
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,760
countries

314
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
your access to government services also

315
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,720
done digitally

316
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,079
so safeguarding your credentials becomes

317
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,120
the most important thing

318
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,160
right well

319
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,839
security non-experts have always

320
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,920
maintained that you must use antivirus

321
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,720
software strong passwords

322
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,040
change passwords frequently well all of

323
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
you

324
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,480
have probably worked in at least one

325
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,240
company where you had an id policy that

326
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,959
says you must change your password every

327
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,480
x number of weeks

328
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,079
whereas when you look at security

329
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,279
experts um

330
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,920
what they what they recommend as safe

331
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,639
online practice it comes to very boring

332
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,439
stuff

333
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,440
install software updates regularly uh

334
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
choose unique passwords for each service

335
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
that you use

336
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,719
oh and and for the love of everything

337
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,639
that is nice and holy please use

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
two-factor authentication

339
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,000
and use strong passwords and use a

340
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,279
password manager don't write things down

341
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,320
right um so we as practitioners

342
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,439
we follow these sorts of guidelines

343
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,399
but every now and then we log into our

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,000
favorite service

345
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,880
from a different computer and then

346
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,079
the system throws up all kinds of alerts

347
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,360
and safeguards

348
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,760
and says prove to me who you are right

349
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
while some services do a very good job

350
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
of

351
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
you know identifying users coming from a

352
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,880
potentially different place

353
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
than what the system thinks the user

354
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,279
should be coming from

355
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,760
it's not always obvious even some of us

356
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,360
who are very sophisticated sometimes

357
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,639
receive an email

358
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,079
that says my billing um that

359
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399
you know there is some difficulty with

360
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
billing uh would you please click here

361
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,079
and update

362
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,760
right imagine getting this email um

363
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,519
while you're watching the show and you

364
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,439
got up to get a drink or a glass of

365
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,440
water or whatever you check your phone

366
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,320
and here is this email

367
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,079
well how many of us actually take a

368
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,279
pause go back to our desktop

369
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,760
open this email look at the url and say

370
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,959
aha this is a phishing email i must not

371
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,439
click

372
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,439
right our first instinct is to look at

373
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,959
this well it looks like netflix well it

374
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
kind of looks like the netflix red

375
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,239
button

376
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,920
and it says your friends at netflix so

377
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,920
it must be true let me click on it

378
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:19,279
right my point my point is that um

379
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,399
stressed humans are cognitively impaired

380
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,160
and these stresses and stressors occur

381
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,160
in our day-to-day life

382
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,680
uh when we're doing a lot of uh when

383
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,959
we're using our mobile phones

384
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,560
in everyday scenarios and information

385
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,239
asymmetry does not help

386
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,920
the situation if you're not an expert or

387
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,560
a security expert

388
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,199
it is really difficult uh to counter

389
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,719
some of these

390
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,719
attacks that have become really really

391
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,839
sophisticated in modern times

392
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,199
i guess the answer to this is for us to

393
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,320
pay attention

394
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:56,000
to the user experience when we throw up

395
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,160
security alerts or caution dialogues

396
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,199
or change the workflow because of a

397
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,240
suspected

398
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,959
uh security incident we need to make

399
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,760
sure

400
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,079
that we think about the information

401
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,519
asymmetry between the practitioner

402
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,399
and the user on the other side i want to

403
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,120
i want to close

404
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,680
with a example of what happens when you

405
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,880
close

406
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,760
information asymmetry gaps um

407
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,560
in 2007 there was a research article in

408
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,199
the quarterly journal of economics

409
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,199
where the author explores information

410
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,800
asymmetry that existed

411
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,800
in the fisheries segment in the state of

412
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,639
kerala india

413
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,479
so prior to the introduction of mobile

414
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,639
phones i'm talking mobile phones not

415
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,279
smartphones so this is 2007 the year

416
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,519
that the first iphone was introduced

417
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,720
and in india at that time the feature

418
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,639
phones were still

419
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,920
pretty common and so before the

420
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,320
introduction of these uh

421
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,719
these these mobile phones there was

422
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,399
tremendous price variability in the spot

423
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,320
price of fishes

424
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,639
in different regions within within a

425
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,279
single state in india

426
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,440
and the chart on the left shows you the

427
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,360
gradual ramp up of mobile phones

428
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,040
at the moment the penetration achieved

429
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
close to 100

430
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,399
you can see correspondingly the price

431
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
variability

432
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,480
also dramatically dropped

433
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,079
right in hindsight you know this

434
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,000
this is this is seems obvious but to me

435
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,920
you know this is this is remarkable

436
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,880
example of how

437
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,360
closing information asymmetry gaps leads

438
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,759
to

439
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,320
you know beneficial effects for our

440
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,320
consumer

441
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,000
when we think about security and privacy

442
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,920
it's not just

443
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,880
an algorithmic process or a cryptography

444
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,560
or a legal policy compliance etc we

445
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,279
absolutely must

446
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
seriously consider the human angle of it

447
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,600
as well

448
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,360
so there is there is need in the

449
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,279
research community to focus

450
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,880
on the humanist side of security and

451
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,720
privacy

452
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,160
we must think holistically about

453
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,279
security and not just

454
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,040
um get stuck in the weeds and

455
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,679
we should always pay attention to the

456
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,760
consumers

457
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
thank you and if you have questions i'm

458
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,919
happy to answer them

459
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,799
otherwise um i i hope to give back some

460
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,760
time

461
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,839
um we seem to have ended at 9 00 a.m

462
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,839
precisely on time thank you

463
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,000
thanks a lot thank you so much sudhi for

464
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,678
that closing

465
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,320
i am watching

466
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,320
our chat for questions right now

467
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,600
right if if anybody has questions just

468
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,679
please

469
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,520
also use the raise hands feature

470
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,840
in zoom or just simply unmute yourself

471
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
here

472
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,600
so i will while people are still typing

473
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,000
you mirrored something that alex has

474
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
said

475
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,520
in his keynote before

476
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
the issue of complexity one of your

477
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,799
icebergs that i

478
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,240
that i'm fully on board with is

479
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,520
complexity and

480
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,520
how specifically for modern phones this

481
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,639
seems to be exploding and actually

482
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,840
getting bursts year over year

483
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,320
both for hardware and software

484
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,280
be that firmware or what we typically

485
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,520
call the

486
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,399
system software do you see this going

487
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,480
so how do you think we can manage to

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
cope with this complexity or

489
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
would you say that we just have to deal

490
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,440
with rising complexity

491
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,399
and mitigate make small pockets of lower

492
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,360
complexity

493
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,080
and deal with those instead what do you

494
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,559
think we're

495
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,720
we're heading or maybe where should we

496
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,480
be heading

497
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,480
so um my

498
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,799
my fear is that the security community

499
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,160
is not

500
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,559
uniformly distributed across different

501
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,320
um micro segments within within our

502
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,520
field for example

503
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,240
you know one might say that um people

504
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,480
who make

505
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,440
um merchant silicon uh system on chips

506
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,000
and folks like google android team we

507
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,960
may have

508
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
excellent security engineers but the

509
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,240
same

510
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,160
possibly cannot be said of you know

511
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,520
smaller players that make

512
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,120
lcds lcd controllers or

513
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,320
smaller companies that make a dedicated

514
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,918
chip for doing

515
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,559
some particular task and the reason why

516
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,160
i think

517
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,399
um i'm mostly right is these smaller

518
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
players show up in the iot segment very

519
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,200
very frequently

520
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,678
and if you want to see where the broader

521
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,080
information gap exists all you have to

522
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,080
do is look at the iot segment and see

523
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,520
how many of them practice safe security

524
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,439
practices

525
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,639
there was an article in zdnet that i

526
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,440
read a couple of days ago that said

527
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,799
majority of consumer routers worldwide

528
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,120
never receive security updates

529
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,799
right for us this is mind-blowing

530
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,678
because we think that this is a solved

531
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,320
problem

532
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
we have tools we have well-known

533
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,158
techniques for doing

534
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,600
delta based software updates right you

535
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,280
have orchestration systems

536
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,439
multiple open source orchestration

537
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,158
systems for doing over-the-air firmware

538
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,600
update

539
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,159
yet nobody does this right if we dig

540
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
deeper

541
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,320
i suspect um we will also discover that

542
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,918
as you go lower into the firmware stack

543
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,760
you know basic things like

544
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,960
secure verified boot may also be missing

545
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,960
right so um

546
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,320
the answer may be that we need to we

547
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,559
need to educate the next generation of

548
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,678
of of students and researchers and

549
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
practitioners

550
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,480
to think about security from the ground

551
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,240
up and know what are these constructs

552
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,240
and make sure there is an opinionated

553
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,919
path for some of these security

554
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,960
constructs

555
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,720
when when google discovered that

556
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,760
tls ssl is a foundational element

557
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,000
for the web and openssl

558
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
would have uh you know every every

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
alternate tuesday with the new bug

560
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,720
report

561
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,360
somebody at google called adam langley

562
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,919
decided that security needs to be boring

563
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,240
they created a boring version of openssl

564
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,240
called boring ssl

565
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,240
i'm wondering if a similar boring

566
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,400
security approach needs to be taken

567
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,760
for a variety of narrowly scoped

568
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,240
components

569
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,440
across our technology stack right

570
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,720
eliminate

571
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,080
the complexity associated with choice

572
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,360
and provide narrowly scoped answers to

573
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,799
common problems

574
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,799
maybe that's a good starting point

575
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,280
thank you we have a first question

576
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,679
by danielle who is also i think still

577
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,600
dialed into the meeting danielle do you

578
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,880
want to ask yourself

579
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,240
um okay so you um uh talked about

580
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,080
credential stealing and

581
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,000
basically fishing on mobile which is um

582
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,678
i think worse than on desktop mostly

583
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,840
because there's not enough screen real

584
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,240
estate to show as much detail

585
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,240
so how do we address phishing on mobile

586
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,559
that's a very good question i don't have

587
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,320
answers but

588
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:33,918
my my intuition is that um we need to do

589
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,320
much more um user studies

590
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,240
ux experiments to see what is the best

591
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,918
way to surface this

592
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,039
um it it's not entirely obvious to me

593
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,799
um what is what is the right answer here

594
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,039
um i the reason i raise these problems

595
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,960
is because i don't have answers i'm

596
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,000
hoping i'm really hoping that the

597
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,320
research community

598
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
can can can invest a little bit of time

599
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,918
thinking about the user experience of

600
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,720
security issues and

601
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,320
come up with hypotheses and test them

602
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,559
renee do you have a better answer than

603
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,559
this

604
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,480
i agree with daniel that probably for

605
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,679
mobile devices

606
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,919
the hard part is real screen estate

607
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,559
which maps back to what you also said in

608
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,320
your

609
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,120
talk that um attention is one of the key

610
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,720
elements

611
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,000
how do we um manage attention

612
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,039
for users who are attention

613
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,720
overloaded who are stressed maybe

614
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,600
maybe the answer goes back to what you

615
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,960
said in reducing stressing factor stress

616
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,879
source to be able to

617
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,279
allow to concentrate on the right things

618
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,920
but again i don't have

619
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,760
a good answer because that question on

620
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,880
[Music]

621
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,320
how to surface the right

622
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,200
amount of information on a very small

623
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,559
screen

624
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,400
i think has existed since we had devices

625
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,918
with small screens since

626
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,200
we had first smartphones i

627
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,880
unfortunately i don't have a good answer

628
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,880
to that either besides

629
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,360
trying out different things trying out

630
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,679
how we can surface

631
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,760
the right amount of information which

632
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,159
incidentally actually maps to the

633
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,440
second question that that we had pretty

634
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,919
much the same time

635
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,080
in the q a chat by paul blundell who

636
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,240
i don't see dialed into the stream

637
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,480
meeting so i'll just read it

638
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,320
do you feel the android permission

639
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,159
system is a success

640
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,960
if you could step back 10 years what

641
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,200
would you do from the start differently

642
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,000
i lost that question because hindsight

643
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,039
is such a

644
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,919
good thing specifically in security so

645
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,919
what's your take

646
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,440
this is this is an excellent opportunity

647
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,799
for me to

648
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,799
put my foot in my mouth

649
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,000
um this is a good this is a very very

650
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,000
good question um

651
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,120
you know in hindsight i wish i wish

652
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,120
we were a little more diligent in

653
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,399
thinking about all sorts of permissions

654
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,639
their interactions and how do you

655
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
surface how do you determine which of

656
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,279
these permissions require user

657
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,400
consent versus not

658
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,919
and how do you surface these consents to

659
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,919
the user i wish i wish there was a

660
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,120
little bit more

661
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,120
understanding back then

662
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,559
i'm not saying people people didn't

663
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,080
think about it

664
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,600
because android was so new because

665
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,439
smartphones were so new

666
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,840
the available information space for you

667
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,720
to wander in was obviously very limited

668
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,959
right

669
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,159
uh but if in the future we have a chance

670
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,559
to do so

671
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,200
i think a good way to to look at it is

672
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,320
to partition permissions into those that

673
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,039
that are sensitive and which of these

674
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
require

675
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,279
user consent strong user consent

676
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,840
which of these deal with private data

677
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,840
right

678
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,879
figure out a few of the axes that are

679
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,279
important

680
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,159
and try to put each of the permissions

681
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,279
in

682
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,840
in in some some hypercube

683
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,520
n-dimensional hypercube so we can reason

684
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,760
better about them

685
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,799
right today they're all in a flat space

686
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,080
and it makes

687
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,639
reasoning very difficult and because of

688
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,439
backwards compatibility reasons

689
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,320
you know we're forced on an incremental

690
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,200
approach of

691
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,559
solving the problem maybe it'd be

692
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,640
interesting to see if somebody in the

693
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,678
research community totally rethinks the

694
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,679
whole permissions thing

695
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,520
without worrying about backwards

696
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,240
compatibility or forward compatibility

697
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,679
and reimagine what is the right way to

698
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,480
present this information and build a

699
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,279
prototype

700
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,679
might be very interesting to see what we

701
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,880
learn

702
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,880
from that exercise

703
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,640
yeah i can think of one particular

704
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,640
example where

705
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
many of us are probably now eating our

706
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,720
birds

707
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,120
or um feeling that

708
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,120
had we known about the current situation

709
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,719
we would have decided at least that one

710
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,000
tiny thing of permissions grouping

711
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,640
differently which is the

712
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,360
the ble locate a ble beacon scanning

713
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,200
permission

714
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,600
in the location group right with all the

715
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,360
um exposure notification apps the

716
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,080
contact tracing apps out there

717
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,678
that has become a major hurdle to

718
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,000
adoption that

719
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,200
they have to ask for the location

720
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,840
permission group

721
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,840
for very good reasons historically there

722
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,399
were good reasons why this was

723
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,158
put in that group but right now it's

724
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,320
right now it's the wrong grouping

725
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,679
and so yeah i totally agree that yeah

726
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,720
those will have to change

727
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,080
and will have to be redefined

728
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,440
yeah and i really think it's uh

729
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
the research community has an

730
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,640
opportunity here to

731
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,439
reimagine the world and present some

732
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,919
results

733
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,640
good or bad of how this could be

734
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,880
rethought

735
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,880
right

736
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,639
we have another question in the chat

737
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,440
from uh martin

738
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,159
is reducing information asymmetry

739
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,399
something that

740
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,960
drives the design of security controls

741
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,959
in android

742
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,520
yes i think so i think a large part of

743
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,039
it

744
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,080
large part of our day-to-day

745
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,640
conversations is around

746
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,799
how do we make the user really

747
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,240
understand

748
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:47,200
the choice presented to them and is

749
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
is the choice comprehensible to the

750
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,279
average user

751
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,720
not not one living in in in

752
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,039
in bay area building android devices but

753
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,720
really one of our 2.5 billion users

754
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,480
worldwide can they really understand

755
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,520
when they say allow for a particular

756
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,880
permission to understand what that means

757
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,158
and we also spend a lot of time

758
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,600
thinking about um

759
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,520
information asymmetry that exists

760
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,279
between application developers and the

761
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,240
platform developers

762
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,640
and how do you how do you make sure that

763
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,279
uh

764
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,480
certain apis cannot be abused or misused

765
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,080
right either intentionally or

766
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,279
accidentally more more often than not

767
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,120
accidentally

768
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,679
and so we we spend a lot of time

769
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,678
thinking about

770
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,000
what a particular feature means to its

771
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,840
constituent

772
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
be it the developer or the consumer

773
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
i don't know if i answer that question

774
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,200
but yes

775
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,520
i think so um i'm just double checking

776
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,799
the chat to see if if we have any other

777
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,158
questions i think people

778
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,158
are still typing

779
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,918
so as we are nearing the end

780
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:22,879
of the symposium i guess this is a case

781
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:25,679
of last call for questions

782
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
we can of course also take them offline

783
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,559
so

784
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,440
that's something that um i'd like to

785
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,639
encourage

786
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,240
all participants to to still use the

787
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,159
virtual conference when you

788
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,240
even after we close the live stream

789
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,880
because this dedicated

790
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,279
chat system instance will remain open

791
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,480
and

792
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,120
feel free to just keep using it for at

793
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,799
least

794
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,399
a week or so to either interact to

795
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,440
connect with each other

796
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,080
or to just continue asking questions in

797
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,600
the program

798
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,720
day one or program day two q a

799
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,199
session chats and authors can then maybe

800
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,519
just

801
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,519
answer those questions also in textual

802
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,200
form

803
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,840
otherwise um sudhi thank you so much

804
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,720
for doing this thank you so much for

805
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,760
closing

806
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,120
our android security symposium with this

807
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,879
talk

808
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,439
i'm also pretty sad that we couldn't

809
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,960
have you over here in linz

810
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,200
even the weather has turned out nice

811
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,919
very nice today but the promise still

812
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,360
stands

813
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,440
we will have um proper food

814
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,120
proper drinks over here in austria i'm

815
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,159
i'm certain that

816
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,399
there will be other chances to do so and

817
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,159
of course we're all hoping for the

818
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,279
travel situation to

819
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,640
clear clear up somewhat yes indeed when

820
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,679
that happens

821
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,760
nobody knows but i'm

822
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,840
optimistic i'm positive it will happen

823
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,039
and then we will get you over here to

824
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,039
austria and

825
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,720
show you the sights that's a promise

826
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,080
that still stands

827
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,600
excellent thank you so much i look

828
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,639
forward to it and thank you for having

829
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,639
me renee

830
