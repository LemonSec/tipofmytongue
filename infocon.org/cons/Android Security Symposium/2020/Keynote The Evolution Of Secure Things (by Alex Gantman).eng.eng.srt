1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,760
welcome everybody again

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,639
for our session for our second session

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,920
today

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,039
the first keynote which will be given by

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,520
alex gandman who is the

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,520
vice president of engineering at

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,759
qualcomm technologies

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
and has been responsible for the

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,960
security of qualcomm products

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,120
for quite some time

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,440
alex is also one of the main hosts of

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,160
the

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,040
qualcomm mobile security summit which

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,599
has

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,320
as many of you will probably know always

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,680
addressed

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,440
a very similar community to the android

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,879
security symposium

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,440
and if i'm informed correctly the next

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,160
edition of this qualcomm security summit

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,320
will be held in 2021 and will of course

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,440
as organizers will do our best

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
not to have it collide as it so nearly

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,358
did sometime

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
in the past with that we're very much

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,920
looking forward to your talk

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,439
alex over to you and to san diego thank

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
you renee for the introduction thanks

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,320
for hosting me

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,679
uh you know when renee uh invited me to

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,199
speak you know i asked him okay so what

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,680
do you want me to talk about

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
he told me like anything you want to uh

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
so you

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
kind of have to be careful what you wish

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
for

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
so i reflected on you know what can i

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,360
talk about and i wanted to talk about

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,799
how i've seen

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,560
kind of how my thinking about the

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,240
evolution of uh

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,720
security in the products that we make

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,158
has evolved or has progressed

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,000
uh how i see that security evolving

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:48,799
and kind of what i see we can do

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
to improve and accelerate that process

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,039
let me see okay quick intro you know

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
uh on top of what renee already said

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,759
like renee said my name is alex i work

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
at qualcomm

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,840
i've been at qualcomm essentially you

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,560
know forever since the end of last

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
century

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
i joined as an intern here's before and

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
after

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
i think qualcomm has been pretty good to

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,720
me um i think i've been

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,319
you know some used to qualcomm as well

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,599
i've been working on security there

60
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,879
since basically since 2000 so i spent

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,200
the last 20 years

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,840
working on improving the security of

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,839
mobile products

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
i used to be a real security engineer

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,799
these days i mostly make slides

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,640
badly a few disclosures

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
it's still early here so technically i

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,079
haven't clocked in yet

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,160
so i'm here in my personal capacity

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
right i'm going to be sharing some

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
personal opinions please don't

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
contribute them to

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,080
qualcomm please don't get me in trouble

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,680
with my management

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
so i wanted to do something different

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
today i wanted to give an optimistic

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
security talk

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,800
because i'm that rarest of unicorns an

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
optimistic security engineer

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
this may come as somewhat of a surprise

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
to those of you that know me because i

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,440
do try to maintain a fairly kind of

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,040
solid facade

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,480
of skepticism and devil's advocacy

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
but that's mostly just so that i can

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,200
pass myself off as a real security

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,159
engineer and fit in with my peers

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
i have in fact i have the distinct honor

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
of having been called the most

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,840
depressing person he has ever met

91
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,839
uh by chris evans this was back when

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
chris led google's project zero

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
and i think at some conference over

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,159
drinks i tried to explain how patching

95
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,159
works in the mobile ecosystem

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,920
to him um but you know nonetheless

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,200
i assure you kind of deep at heart i'm

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,399
an optimist

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,959
and that optimism is not born of

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,760
uh you know any sense of naivete right

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,239
i've spent enough years in this industry

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,959
to feel like i've really been uh you

103
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,599
know i've seen

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,080
inside the total perspective vortex i've

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,159
seen

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
the kind of the unimaginable infinite

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,079
complexity of the mobile ecosystem

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
and my own insignificance within it you

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
know a tiny marker

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,959
a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,079
that says you are here

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,480
but in spite of that or as i'll talk

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,639
more perhaps

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,680
because of that um i excuse me

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,359
uh i have developed a rather an

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,359
optimistic outlook

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,680
yeah so i understand that uh

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,479
kind of a cheery security engineer

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
is a bit of an oxymoron and does not

120
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,039
naturally

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,000
engender trust and confidence so i must

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,960
first build up

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
some credibility with this audience by

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,039
basically

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
you know scaring you and telling you how

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,960
everything is broken so here we go

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,440
okay we're all doomed

128
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,039
hold on let me make this better okay

129
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,800
okay there we go

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,720
okay so we're all doing and

131
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
i i i have to admit and if i was putting

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
the slides together you know

133
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,199
this is not as shocking these days as it

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
used to be because

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
you know now you know you open the news

136
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,198
and you have

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,800
this like infinite array of choices to

138
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
be doomed by

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
uh but that aside i'm talking about a

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,080
very specific thing

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,360
um particularly that we're doomed to

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,840
never really never fully understand

143
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,160
our own creations and

144
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,000
it's kind of for engineers it's hard to

145
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
accept right because as engineers we

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,479
have

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,159
this god complex

148
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,840
right like we're the creators like i

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,320
created this thing and

150
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,000
as the creator of this thing um you know

151
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,080
i should be able to create it

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
just to you know to do exactly what i

153
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,479
want and just what i want

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
moreover there's almost like a sense of

155
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
entitlement that just because you

156
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,198
created you have to really understand

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,960
how it works

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,080
and it's not really

159
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,799
kind of this sense of entitlement is not

160
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
really

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,560
supported by available uh you know

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
evidence right this is kind of

163
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
you know one cute counter example like

164
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,639
you know any idiot can make one

165
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,759
like you know we made two still have no

166
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
idea how they work

167
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,600
all right although granted this is a

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,319
little bit out of realm of engineering

169
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,840
but the reason we will never fully

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,240
understand our own creations

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:31,039
is complexity right this is a

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,720
somewhat random picture i got when i

173
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,360
googled for software complexity this is

174
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
a chart

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,560
of relationships between classes in the

176
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
hibernate java library

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,759
right and you have to keep in mind that

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
this in itself is again

179
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,960
just a microscopic dot on a microscopic

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
dot

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,919
within some larger system right

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
and kind of the details don't matter

183
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,120
right i just wanted to illustrate you

184
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,120
know something that shows complexity

185
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,520
perhaps a better choice would have been

186
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,360
uh kind of like a modern system on it

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,639
you know the diagram of a modern system

188
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,000
on the chip but

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,919
you know that would require me to talk

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,680
to way too many lawyers so i just

191
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:11,039
googled for something instead uh

192
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,800
so yes so basically

193
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,000
and the complexity of the things that

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,440
we're creating the complexity of

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,199
technological creations is

196
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,599
rapidly approaching the complexity of

197
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,960
living organisms the um

198
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,280
you know if you look at the kind of the

199
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,120
number of transistors in modern systems

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,000
you know the number of bits of state and

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:40,240
software it is immense and

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,319
ironically the very mechanism we use

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,160
to cope with this complexity and to

204
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
build even more complexity

205
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
is the very thing that limits our

206
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,560
understanding of what it is that we've

207
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,318
built

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,080
i'm talking about abstractions right

209
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,120
because abstractions

210
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,080
provide a simplified model of the system

211
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,080
right

212
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,199
they provide a simplified model of the

213
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,878
layer below

214
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,720
to enable the builder you know the

215
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
designer the engineer

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,840
kind of to free up their cognitive

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,919
capacity

218
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,280
to deal with more complexity of the

219
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,318
layer above

220
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,638
and the key word here is simplified

221
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,440
right the kind of the paradox of the

222
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599
abstraction

223
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
is that it can only be useful if it is

224
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,878
wrong because if it doesn't simplify if

225
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
it doesn't hide some information

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,960
it doesn't provide its kind of core

227
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
value

228
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,318
so i like to use this diagram to

229
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,440
illustrate the point

230
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
right we have a nice kind of simplified

231
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,360
abstraction straight lines

232
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,399
uh right angles on the left we have

233
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
reality which is

234
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,320
still a very simplified view but bear

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,440
with me right it's a bit more complex

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
right you have the curved curved corners

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,480
that are harder to model

238
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,200
and obviously if you overlay the two

239
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,000
there's going to be some delta

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,519
and in our field there's a very specific

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,200
technical term for that difference

242
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,440
between abstraction and reality

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,440
right like we call it a vulnerability

244
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,880
and uh if you think about it really

245
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,240
most if not all types of vulnerabilities

246
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,959
fit this metaphor pretty well right so

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,640
you know like we miss uh buffer flow

248
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
vulnerabilities because the abstraction

249
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,399
of a function call

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,560
hides the kind of the detail of passing

251
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,920
the return address through the stack

252
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,079
and we miss integer overflow

253
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,360
vulnerabilities because the abstraction

254
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,600
of arithmetic and c and its derivatives

255
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,040
looks so much like the arithmetic we

256
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,160
learned in primary school

257
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,640
and hides the truncation and wraparound

258
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,439
of

259
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
the modular arithmetic underneath and

260
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,320
then we miss things like grow hammer

261
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
because

262
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
the abstraction of linear random access

263
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,680
memory

264
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
hides all the details of the physics of

265
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,680
dram and

266
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,959
you know how that works right

267
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,439
in fact you know this is also the reason

268
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,119
why

269
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
you know in my view so much of the

270
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,040
security education

271
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,320
is really about unlearning the lies

272
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,839
taught in the core

273
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:04,480
computer science curriculum okay

274
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,320
so an abstraction um

275
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,000
oh yeah i should say by the way right

276
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,920
and if you zoom in

277
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,760
kind of this problem is fractal right

278
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,680
because again the difference between

279
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,839
abstraction reality you know reality is

280
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,199
very messy right like it doesn't have

281
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,320
nice

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,279
uh kind of straight lines

283
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,000
and again the more you zoom in the more

284
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,600
kind of delta you see

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,360
so what happens is like as a build

286
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
nervous system right the designer thinks

287
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,680
that they're working

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,320
on kind of these solid layers solid

289
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,000
bricks with

290
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,320
kind of no gaps between them that all

291
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,519
fit in

292
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,640
and in reality

293
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,320
so these vulnerabilities um and

294
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,079
you know sergey broads has this

295
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
you know very eloquent say layers of

296
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,120
abstraction become boundaries of

297
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,279
competence

298
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,040
and that is of course what they're meant

299
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
to be right again the abstraction is

300
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
meant to hide the complexity of the

301
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,399
layer beneath

302
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,000
but that means that kind of a person

303
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,240
working at the top of this pyramid right

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,480
like so a developer working on a

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,560
i don't know a cad filter for your uh

306
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
you know for some camera app

307
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,439
will never understand the full

308
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,360
complexity the full details of the

309
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
entire system below

310
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,040
right you know the language runtime

311
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,959
garbage collection and the operating

312
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,519
system permission model

313
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,040
and the you know cpu cache hierarchy

314
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,200
and the physics of dram and the

315
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,839
chemistry of silicon dopants and the

316
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,440
you know in the chip right like it's not

317
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,640
going to happen like they will never

318
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
understand the full thing

319
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,160
like and none of us will really fully

320
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,000
understand how our computers work

321
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
but that's how modern technology kind of

322
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
advances right like we keep adding layer

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,839
upon layer onto this

324
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
kind of tower and really it's all kind

325
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
of

326
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
tightly packed layers it's not just

327
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,560
layers of abstraction it's tightly

328
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,079
packed layers of vulnerabilities okay

329
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,439
so hopefully that was sufficiently

330
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,160
kind of demoralizing to convince you

331
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,959
that i am

332
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,839
indeed like a real security professional

333
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,599
and

334
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,600
normally this is where security talk

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,959
would end right we're doomed

336
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
thank you please don't forget to follow

337
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,239
me on twitter okay i believe we have

338
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,279
you know some time for q a and that used

339
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,959
to be me

340
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,839
right like you know early on in my

341
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,760
career i actually got the nickname dr

342
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,440
evil you know this was the early 2000s

343
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,920
uh austin powers movies were still

344
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,920
popular

345
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,199
and i picked up a reputation for coming

346
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
up with

347
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,399
essentially these like movie plot

348
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,040
business models you know for you know a

349
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,240
billion dollars uh that attackers could

350
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
build by

351
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,760
uh you know exploiting different

352
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,720
vulnerabilities and keep in mind this

353
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,959
was before

354
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
uh you know we could just say hey it's a

355
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,119
bug fix it

356
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
right when we have to go through the

357
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,720
whole dance of well but why would

358
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
anybody ever do that

359
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
luckily we've sort of moved on from that

360
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,199
largely

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,079
um so anyway like i said so i got this

362
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
nickname

363
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,800
for you know all my dire predictions of

364
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,560
you know how things will go wrong

365
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,959
and you know things were getting fixed

366
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,839
right like you know we had some success

367
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,439
but you know things

368
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
are never fixed as quickly as you would

369
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
hope so

370
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,720
you know i'm i was perpetually worried

371
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,639
about all of you know my dire

372
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,160
predictions coming true

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,600
but years went by and you know people

374
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,120
went online

375
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,639
and they banked and they shopped

376
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,079
and you know there was some crime but

377
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,720
there's always crime and the overall

378
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,160
crime rate

379
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,560
went down and

380
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,079
you know like cities did not burn down

381
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,199
or you know cities didn't burn

382
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,880
financial system did not collapse well

383
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,399
okay like all of those things happen but

384
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
none of it happened because of a

385
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,839
you know buffer overflow in the phone or

386
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,519
anything like that or

387
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,199
in software at all so after a while i

388
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,600
had to reconcile with the fact that the

389
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,639
world kept on spinning

390
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,079
and that's what led me to kind of

391
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,600
my current sunny outlook that you know a

392
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,560
realization that despite all of this

393
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,160
complexity

394
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,638
like even if we can't understand it

395
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,600
right but despite all of that complexity

396
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,560
you know the products that we make you

397
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,399
know evolve

398
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,399
kind of resilience to the threats that

399
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,560
they face in the world around them

400
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,560
you know almost like living organisms

401
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,760
so hopefully uh you know some of you

402
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,639
recognized

403
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,639
the title of my talk the evolution of

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,560
secure things as a reference to henry

405
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,920
petrovsky's book the evolution of useful

406
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,959
things

407
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,800
and uh in this book

408
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,439
petrovsky lays out the history of how

409
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,479
kind of common household objects like

410
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,480
the paper clip in the fork

411
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
came you know to look the way they look

412
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,360
how do they get

413
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,479
their current shapes and

414
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,959
essentially his central thesis is that

415
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,560
form does not follow function the form

416
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,160
follows failure

417
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,719
and what he means by that is you don't

418
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,560
get the shape of a paperclip for example

419
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
by getting some you know smart person to

420
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,479
sit down and think really hard about

421
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,360
identification what's the ideal

422
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
kind of minimalist tool or you know

423
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,519
mechanism that can

424
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,120
hold a few these you know loose leaf of

425
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,399
paper together

426
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,639
right the way you get a paper clip is

427
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,560
through or anything else is right this

428
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
through many generations of

429
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
uh kind of iterative trial and error

430
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
right

431
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,160
somebody comes up with something and it

432
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,160
works kind of well kind of okay

433
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,680
but then people observe the ways in

434
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
which it is lacking and they try to

435
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,279
improve on it like more precisely

436
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,479
and if not every alteration is an

437
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
improvement right you know some

438
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
alterations lead you kind of to an

439
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,279
evolutionary dead end

440
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,279
but this you know the process of you

441
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,360
know trying and seeing what sticks and

442
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,959
what makes things better is what

443
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,120
eventually leads you

444
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,399
to some uh ideal shape

445
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,839
now notably he points out that this

446
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,160
evolutionary process

447
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
doesn't necessarily converge on one

448
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,639
ideal

449
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,360
uh form factor right on one ideal shape

450
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,560
uh the kind of most obvious example are

451
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,160
eating utensils

452
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,079
right this is you know the problem of

453
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,920
conveying food from you know plate to

454
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,959
masses is all this time

455
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,959
um you know this is human something

456
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,079
humans have been doing forever

457
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,160
and yet we see different cultures

458
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,519
come up with vastly different tools for

459
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,439
the problem right you know

460
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
again most notably the fork and

461
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
chopsticks

462
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
right so it's not like there's one ideal

463
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
solution you can have multiple solutions

464
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
and

465
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,839
which one you end up with and it depends

466
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:55,040
on the evolutionary path you take

467
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,920
and when i read this book

468
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,360
i was struck by how much about you know

469
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,399
petrovsky's description about the

470
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
evolution of

471
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,520
everyday things resonated with me and

472
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,039
kind of reminded me of

473
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,799
um how i view the evolution of security

474
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,280
of things right again the similar thing

475
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,679
is

476
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,678
you know how we keep trying things and

477
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,120
we keep improving on the failures of the

478
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,280
or the shortcomings of the past

479
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,799
generation and

480
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
you know i think some people view it as

481
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,839
a failure of our profession

482
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,678
that we don't get things right on the

483
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,438
first try um

484
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,720
but i'm not sure anything other than

485
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,320
this kind of evolutionary approach

486
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,640
is really reasonable to expect um

487
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,159
and like moreover like with most

488
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,960
evolutionary processes

489
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,520
the outcomes are far like far better

490
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,559
than they have

491
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,000
any right to be right and i think over

492
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,200
time commodity computers

493
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,039
have become they're very resilient to

494
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,640
the common threats around them and

495
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,720
look they'll never be perfect right and

496
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,799
they're always gaps but they continue to

497
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,600
evolve

498
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,320
now i think understanding the

499
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,320
evolutionary

500
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240
forces in play can help us speed up the

501
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,200
process and

502
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,039
one of the kind of one of the most i

503
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,480
think critical forces in play

504
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,440
is consumer demand

505
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,559
so i believe that in consumer markets in

506
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,080
particular

507
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,760
security is you know can be a

508
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,199
differentiator security does become a

509
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
differentiator but it is the last

510
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
differentiator

511
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,240
meaning that it really begins to impact

512
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
purchasing decisions

513
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,679
only after you know the rate of

514
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,678
introduction of new features slows down

515
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,520
so and if you know when essentially when

516
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,960
the product becomes commoditized right

517
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,879
like when all products more or less look

518
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,559
the same then people want reliability

519
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,880
you know security and the broader

520
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,039
reliability and safety

521
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,559
uh and you know we can look at a few

522
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,039
historical

523
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,039
examples right i think um if you

524
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,120
remember what it was like to buy a pc in

525
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,440
the 90s

526
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,799
right by the time you brought it home

527
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
and finished setting it up

528
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,160
it was essentially an outdated pile of

529
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,880
junk right like you could go back to the

530
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,480
store

531
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,039
a few weeks later buy something that was

532
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,320
twice as fast for half the price

533
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,919
it's you know like every uh kind of

534
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,439
you know you would longingly look at

535
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,200
every ad that came in

536
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,880
about you know what new computers are

537
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
available and you know keep dreaming

538
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
about

539
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,678
when you can upgrade so in that climate

540
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,200
every time something went wrong you know

541
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,799
every time you had a crash every time

542
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,840
you had a virus infection

543
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,679
it was annoying it was frustrating and

544
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,959
it was one more excuse to do what you

545
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,160
really wanted which is to get rid of

546
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,679
this one and go buy a new one

547
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,200
then at around 2000 the hardware is fast

548
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,280
enough

549
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
we get out of order execution cpu so we

550
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
get hyper threading

551
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,480
you know great things never look back

552
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,520
right

553
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,200
the operating system is stable enough

554
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,559
uh you know productivity software is

555
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
great you know office has all the

556
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,760
features you would ever want plus the

557
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,480
you know pay-per-click thingy that pops

558
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,400
up um and all of a sudden

559
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,679
you don't want a new one you want this

560
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,280
one to keep working

561
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
right like yeah you know you could go

562
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,480
buy a new one and you know the plastic

563
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,760
is a bit nicer and the screen is a

564
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
little bit crisper

565
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,240
but you know suddenly upgrading is a

566
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,600
chore you have to move all of your files

567
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,960
and reinstall all your apps and

568
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,918
reconfigure all the settings

569
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,320
like i just want this one to work right

570
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,559
and

571
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,399
so so i think it's not a coincidence

572
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,960
that microsoft's big

573
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,720
you know trustworthy uh computing push

574
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,760
they're rolling out of their

575
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,320
secure development lifecycle

576
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,000
around that time right bill gates

577
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,960
trustworthy computing memo came out in

578
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,960
early 2002

579
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
i think a similar thing can be observed

580
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,520
in the automotive industry and i know

581
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,520
car comparisons are dicey but

582
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,600
kind of bear with me and and i apologize

583
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,639
you know a lot of my examples are going

584
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,918
to be u.s

585
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
centric but i think they uh hopefully

586
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,919
they

587
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,960
uh kind of carry over

588
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,200
to to other um places as well

589
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,120
but at least in the u.s right um

590
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,799
looking at the data widespread

591
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
availability of convenience features

592
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
like

593
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,120
fm radio and air conditioning and

594
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,320
automatic transmission

595
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,000
pre-date availability of safety features

596
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,520
like seat belts and you know airbags and

597
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
anti-lock brakes and again as i said

598
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,559
like even

599
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,760
the basics like seat belts

600
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,760
and it's only kind of after cars become

601
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,120
commoditized right so

602
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,200
uh you know what i remember about

603
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,559
for example car commercials in the again

604
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,320
in the 90s and early 2000s they weren't

605
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,120
advertising different features they were

606
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,320
all advertising

607
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,678
crash safety ratings and warranty dur

608
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,559
you know periods you know how long the

609
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,919
warranty is

610
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,480
right so by that time all the focus has

611
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,440
shifted

612
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,360
to safety and reliability that's at

613
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,200
least until the more

614
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,639
recent automotive renaissance based on

615
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,360
uh computation and connectivity

616
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
and i i think it wasn't all you know

617
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,479
bucktrack

618
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,039
and ralph nader either right without

619
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,200
dismissing or diminishing the role of

620
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,520
activism i think it's important for us

621
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,840
to recognize the other forces in play

622
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,799
and to understand why advocacy efforts

623
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,879
succeeded

624
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,840
at the point that they did because it

625
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,520
wasn't like

626
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
windows security was great throughout

627
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,799
the 90s and nobody said anything right

628
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,360
it wasn't like there wasn't

629
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,280
you know pressure on microsoft to do

630
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,360
something about it

631
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,039
and you know prior to nader's book

632
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
coming out it wasn't like people weren't

633
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,600
dying by you know tens of thousands

634
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,039
every year in the us alone for decades

635
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,799
leading up to that period

636
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,480
but something else happened in that mark

637
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,000
in the market at that time

638
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,760
to kind of to allow that transition

639
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
and i think we're seeing a similar thing

640
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,360
with smartphones now

641
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,320
right uh you know as we've made the

642
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,320
transition from

643
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,439
um

644
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,200
sorry yeah so so i i would argue that

645
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,760
today the smartphone is the most secure

646
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
device

647
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,360
digital device that most people own

648
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,158
right and it wasn't the case

649
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,799
you know 25 20 15 even 10 years ago

650
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,240
probably

651
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,520
maybe even five not sure about that

652
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,400
um but you know once the rate of

653
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,559
introduction

654
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,520
uh once the rate of introduction of new

655
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,639
features has flattened out

656
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,279
we saw this rather sharp

657
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,039
transition of key market players to

658
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,400
focus on security

659
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,400
and it's like it's easy to forget how

660
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,840
sudden that change was and that it

661
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
wasn't always like that

662
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,279
and it kind of makes sense when you

663
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,600
think about it

664
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,200
both from the kind of from the vendor

665
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,559
and from the consumer point of view

666
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
right so from the vendor point of view

667
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,440
security is not free

668
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,159
right security does cost money and it

669
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,200
costs time to market

670
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,039
so when you're in the mode where

671
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,279
the rate of innovation is high and

672
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,440
people want new features

673
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,600
and you know there's you know people are

674
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,120
lining up around the block

675
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,120
on product release day

676
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,080
a vendor that delays the release of

677
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,720
their product to add more security in

678
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,760
without kind of increasing the feature

679
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,799
set

680
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,240
and that's almost a suicidal move

681
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,240
right and

682
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,320
at the same time right like looking at

683
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
it from the customer perspective

684
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,799
we can see it as potentially a rational

685
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,880
choice as well though not necessarily

686
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,879
kind of conscious and explicitly thought

687
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,120
out because if you if you look at

688
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,159
security as the ratio of

689
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,719
benefit to risk then during

690
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,480
periods of rapid innovation your best

691
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,360
way to optimize that ratio maybe to

692
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,159
capitalize on the skyrocketing benefit

693
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,959
right and it's only once it's only once

694
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,120
that

695
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,039
uh flattens out that your only way to

696
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,719
improve that ratio begins to now

697
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,720
kind of decrease the denominator and to

698
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,039
draw down the risk

699
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,480
and look this forum i think provides us

700
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,480
with the perfect example

701
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,039
right we're doing this on zoom right

702
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,159
zoom is not exactly known for their

703
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,200
security first posture and yet

704
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,960
the organizers you know uh

705
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
despite their you know considerable

706
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,799
security expertise

707
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
decided that the features offered by the

708
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,279
platform

709
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,480
outweigh whatever you know security

710
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,279
risks it

711
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,039
brings so clearly you know from a

712
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,679
business perspective zoom made the right

713
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,600
call

714
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,279
you know now having captured you know

715
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,039
significant market share

716
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,200
they can afford to invest in security

717
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,080
and make the program better

718
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
make the tool better and of course in

719
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,080
essence

720
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,799
as consumers we have endorsed that

721
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,240
choice

722
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,720
because that's the tool we chose to use

723
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,840
we didn't choose something that focused

724
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,480
on

725
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,480
security instead um

726
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,600
and i think so so cases like zoom right

727
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,799
bring up the question

728
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,120
okay well why can't uh

729
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,360
vendors focus on security earlier on

730
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,559
like why don't we see more companies

731
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,158
kind of you know why do they leave it um

732
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,158
kind of until the last minute

733
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,799
i think pictures like this help us to

734
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,879
understand why

735
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,158
right so this is most of you are

736
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,240
probably familiar with this picture this

737
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,520
is kind of the canonical

738
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,840
illustration of survivorship bias

739
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,918
so during the second world war u.s

740
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,678
military wanted to know

741
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,440
where they should reinforce their planes

742
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,400
their bombers

743
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
so they surveyed planes coming back from

744
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,679
mission

745
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,840
uh from missions and they mapped out all

746
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,520
the areas that got hit by enemy gunfire

747
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,120
and they created this sort of

748
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,679
hit heat map and the initial proposal

749
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,760
was

750
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,760
okay well you know clearly we have to

751
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,799
reinforce the areas that are getting hit

752
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,360
more

753
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,039
until it's the decision looked at it and

754
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,080
pointed out that they're only looking at

755
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,760
planes

756
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,000
that survive the damage and return to

757
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,279
base right the areas that are blank on

758
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,520
this chart

759
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,640
it's not like enemy fire is miraculously

760
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,240
missing those

761
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,760
parts of the plane the more likely

762
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,799
explanation is that

763
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,600
when uh when that part of the plane gets

764
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,360
hit

765
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,199
it is fatal right and planes that get

766
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,080
hit in those places do not return to

767
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,320
base

768
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,080
so rather than you know dealing with

769
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,600
damage that's not fatal that can be

770
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,158
dealt with after the plane returns

771
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,799
they have to armor the places that are

772
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,399
left blank here

773
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,158
so how does it relate to the topic that

774
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,678
we're discussing so i think similarly

775
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,000
i think there are lots of companies that

776
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,919
focus on security early on

777
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,159
unfortunately the choices that we make

778
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,840
as consumers unfortunately or you know

779
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,000
maybe maybe i shouldn't assign a value

780
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,279
judgment to but

781
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,279
you know the choices we make as

782
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,159
consumers um

783
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,720
kind of these companies don't often

784
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,880
survive

785
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,320
long enough uh for us to know their

786
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
names

787
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,158
right you know early on focus tends to

788
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
be on usability

789
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,000
and features and you know things that

790
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,879
consumers want and the benefit that they

791
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,120
can get out of it

792
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,320
and only after that companies begin to

793
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,320
focus on security

794
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,720
now there's another reason why

795
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:37,279
i think security takes this

796
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,640
go through this evolutionary process and

797
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,360
that's because the product itself

798
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,679
evolves

799
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,439
you can't secure it until you know what

800
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,120
it is

801
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,559
so like this is one of the early

802
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,879
quadrant phones i love this phone by the

803
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,879
way

804
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
probably still one of one of my favorite

805
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,399
phones of all time

806
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,360
but you know properly quote unquote

807
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,520
properly securing this phone in 1995

808
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,439
would have precluded pretty much every

809
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,760
feature of a modern smartphone

810
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,760
right like i mean i can imagine

811
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,360
conversation

812
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,679
let me get this straight you want to

813
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,678
connect this thing to the internet

814
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,720
and you want to allow people to run

815
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
third party code on it

816
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,559
and like and i remember those concerns

817
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,840
right i remember as

818
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,918
phones began to add more and more

819
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,959
features you know camera and apps

820
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,399
and so on there were many kind of

821
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,880
you know especially within the security

822
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,360
community uh there was

823
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,159
angst and concern that you know this is

824
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,320
greatly expanding the attack surface

825
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,760
which was correct right you know people

826
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,439
were saying look i just want a single

827
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,000
purpose device i want the phone to be a

828
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,360
phone and you know nothing else

829
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,679
and while

830
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,360
again as a security engineer like those

831
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,039
concerns were valid yes the attack

832
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,600
surface of a modern device

833
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,960
is much greater than than you know for

834
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,559
phone

835
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,480
uh 20 25 years ago

836
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:05,600
and here miraculously

837
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,880
i claim it is much harder to get remote

838
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,279
code execution

839
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,320
on a modern device than it is on the

840
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,559
phone from 1995.

841
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,960
so somehow the system of evolution works

842
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,120
remarkably well

843
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,279
and i claim that actually the security

844
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,520
of consumer devices has been a huge

845
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,960
success in fact like i'll go a step for

846
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,080
a giant leap further

847
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,120
i will claim that the software um

848
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,399
in consumer devices today is more

849
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,239
resilient

850
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,840
than anything the consumer market has

851
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
ever seen

852
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,639
so think about some of the things you

853
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,600
have in your house

854
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,919
right like an armchair coffee maker you

855
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,158
know

856
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,679
this is a bag but you know say imagine

857
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,000
glasses i'm assuming everybody in this

858
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,120
audience

859
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,080
has glasses eyeglasses

860
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,158
and these are all things designed for

861
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,879
household use you know they look nice

862
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,159
they provide excellent functionality you

863
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,519
know they're priced right for their

864
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,880
target market

865
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,240
um and so on but they also all require

866
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,000
careful handling

867
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,640
right like they're not designed to be

868
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,080
abused in any way

869
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,360
you know i like to say there's nothing

870
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,480
in my house that can survive a

871
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,479
three-year-old with scissors

872
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,799
but in fact like the entire phrase you

873
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,440
know this is why we can't have nice

874
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,760
things

875
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,600
it's based on the prince on the premise

876
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,559
that nice things require careful

877
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,320
handling

878
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:35,600
and you know and if we don't handle them

879
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,600
really carefully then they break

880
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,360
now there's another class of products

881
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,639
that is meant to go into public spaces

882
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,360
you know like a park bench

883
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,399
a train station vending machine a

884
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,240
shopping cart

885
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,719
right you know these things are bulkier

886
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,480
they don't look as nice they're not

887
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,320
the functionality they provide is very

888
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,039
very limited

889
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,639
they're a lot more expensive but you

890
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,799
know they can take

891
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,320
you know some beating right they can

892
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,120
take a scratch you know maybe

893
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,120
you know a baseball bat here or there so

894
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,720
so the interesting thing is things like

895
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,360
phones like smartphones

896
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,120
are in both places at once right on the

897
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,799
one hand this is a consumer device it

898
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,039
has to feel nice and look nice and

899
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,039
provide great functionality

900
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,960
and be reasonably priced on the other

901
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,480
hand the software it runs is connected

902
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,360
to the internet so it's essentially in

903
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,960
the public space

904
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,158
all the time and we now have this

905
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,600
expectation

906
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,880
that the software should be able to

907
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,879
withstand not just

908
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,159
kind of casual abuse from hyperactive

909
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,840
kids and board teenagers

910
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,279
but even targeted attacks from trained

911
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,039
professionals

912
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,600
now pause for a minute to think about

913
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,600
the significance of this change

914
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,080
this is fundamentally this is a

915
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,439
fundamentally different expectation

916
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,320
than consumer you know than we've ever

917
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,640
had for consumer goods before

918
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,320
and really i didn't think this was

919
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,480
possible right like in fact

920
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,240
you know i have i looked at my notes i

921
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,360
have notes back from 2011

922
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,960
where i postulate that you know consumer

923
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,080
goods including software

924
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,799
cannot be made vandal-proof because i

925
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,918
just couldn't find a suitable preference

926
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,279
but you know here we are

927
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,279
i mean look at sorry

928
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,880
look at this chart from zero view and i

929
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,799
i know it's a marketing slide

930
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,600
and you know we have to take it with a

931
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,600
grain of salt but

932
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,279
what else in your house costs

933
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,000
upwards of two million dollars to break

934
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,440
okay and maybe

935
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,440
you know maybe remote attacks are not a

936
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,960
fair comparison like look even at basics

937
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,519
like pin bypass and

938
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,640
you know local privilege installation

939
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,720
like who has a

940
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,240
log that's that cost a hundred thousand

941
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,559
dollars to pick

942
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,519
who has a door that costs 200 000 to

943
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,200
break down

944
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:00,159
like it just it doesn't happen

945
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,279
so i i think this is incredible and i

946
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,640
you know i i still

947
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:08,879
find it hard to come to terms with this

948
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,560
so i think whatever process is in place

949
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,440
here

950
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,679
is clearly producing very good results

951
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,679
and

952
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,480
like i'm not trying to say that look we

953
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:26,158
just should sit back and enjoy the ride

954
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,440
i think we you know we should look at

955
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,720
what can we do

956
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:35,040
to accelerate this process

957
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,399
and you know evolution works by

958
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,480
you know iteratively trying new

959
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,118
mutations and you know seeing what works

960
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,040
and

961
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,480
uh adopting that right so for that for

962
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,839
it you need two things right you need a

963
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,960
useful utility function

964
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,000
some sort of a feedback metric so you

965
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,159
know whether it's

966
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,159
survival in uh you know in biology or

967
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,200
uh you know path coverage and fuzzing or

968
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,480
whatever it is right

969
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,799
but something to tell us that we're

970
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,440
moving in the right direction

971
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,640
and uh you know and we want fast

972
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,720
iteration

973
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,319
now i think in the context that we're

974
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,839
describing the speed of iteration is not

975
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
an issue i think we're iterating fast

976
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,480
enough

977
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,040
you know i don't think we have um a

978
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,560
problem with you know how often

979
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,839
you know how fast products come out how

980
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,839
fast we try new things

981
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
but i do think we have a problem with

982
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,040
the utility function

983
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,280
i think you know the feedback mechanism

984
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,119
that the market provides

985
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,520
kind of works but it's really slow and

986
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,079
imprecise right we never really know why

987
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,440
a product

988
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,079
fails you know whether it's because of

989
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,599
the lack of security or because of

990
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,839
something else

991
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,000
so what we really want is some sort of

992
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,240
rapid accurate feedback

993
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,200
um to see if the change that we've

994
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,439
introduced

995
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,560
has made a thing more secure and

996
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,320
remarkably kind of

997
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,759
mind-bogglingly really we have no real

998
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,000
way of assessing the security of the

999
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,119
thing

1000
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,480
and you know it's again it's just

1001
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,560
mind-boggling that we've gotten

1002
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,440
this far in this field without being

1003
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,960
able to answer such a basic question

1004
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,720
and in fact

1005
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,240
so i'm going to do something now i'm

1006
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,160
actually going to contradict something i

1007
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,640
said earlier but it's a keynote i

1008
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,720
believe i'm allowed to do that

1009
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,319
so i'm going to claim that we actually

1010
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,399
have no idea if computers

1011
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,400
are more secure today than they were 20

1012
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,839
years ago

1013
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,839
so kind of follow me on this brief

1014
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
diversion

1015
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,640
so

1016
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,040
let me ask this question about cars and

1017
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,520
you know car analogy again

1018
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,560
sorry a car is safer to drive today than

1019
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,480
they were for years ago

1020
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,400
how would we answer this question right

1021
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,359
well you know we can look at safety

1022
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,240
features

1023
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,279
but safety features only tell us that

1024
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,919
somebody's trying

1025
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,440
we don't necessarily know if they have

1026
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,520
an impact

1027
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,599
we can look at safety tests again safety

1028
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,280
tests you know somewhat predictive like

1029
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,880
we think this helps

1030
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,480
but we don't really know if that you

1031
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
know if a car that does well in a safety

1032
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,079
test

1033
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,119
actually results in

1034
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,880
kind of a safer experience on the road

1035
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,599
so ideally what we have is

1036
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,480
actual data like actual measurement of

1037
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,200
harm

1038
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,839
right so in the u.s we have this data

1039
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
from the

1040
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,960
national highway traffic safety

1041
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,960
administration nitsa

1042
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,480
right and we can look at fatalities per

1043
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,000
year and we can see that yes from the

1044
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,160
1970s to today

1045
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,400
the number of fatalities per year has

1046
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,839
decreased significantly

1047
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
now there's a complication of course

1048
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,000
because the usage during that time has

1049
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,599
changed a lot as well right the number

1050
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,640
of people the number of cars the amount

1051
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,880
that people drive

1052
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,400
has increased drastically as well so

1053
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,880
ideally we normalize

1054
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,599
this kind of units of harm by units of

1055
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,720
benefit

1056
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,320
so let's say we divided by you know

1057
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,919
vehicle miles travel

1058
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,680
right and when we look at those stats we

1059
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,040
see that the change is even more drastic

1060
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,160
right there's almost a three-fold

1061
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,720
decrease

1062
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,440
in the number of fatalities per mile

1063
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,118
travel

1064
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,040
from the 1970s to today

1065
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,040
so you know so we can look at this data

1066
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,320
and say okay great there's been progress

1067
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,119
now we don't necessarily know

1068
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,960
specifically

1069
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,640
what led to that improvement whether

1070
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,599
that was you know

1071
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,000
speed limits or strong enforcement of

1072
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,599
traffic

1073
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,400
laws or seat belts

1074
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,200
or you know global warming whatever it

1075
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,960
was right

1076
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,200
but we can clearly see that there was

1077
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,800
improvement

1078
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,560
so now we ask the same question about

1079
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,240
computers our computer's more secure

1080
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,720
today than they were you know say 25

1081
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,720
years ago

1082
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,800
so how would we answer that question

1083
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,640
like what is what is the data that we

1084
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,359
would support

1085
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,440
uh our response like what are what are

1086
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,680
what is our measure of harm

1087
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,000
we can't even agree on what units to use

1088
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,160
right is it

1089
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,280
like ideally somewhere right like we

1090
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,319
should be able to say look

1091
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,599
you know this hopefully zero lives lost

1092
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,520
but you know some measure of physical

1093
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,960
harm some measure of financial harm

1094
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,119
and then we want to again normalize it

1095
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,079
by measure of benefit i have no idea how

1096
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,320
we

1097
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,280
like what units we would use for benefit

1098
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,000
right is it

1099
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,880
per number of transistors in the world

1100
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,599
for a number of

1101
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,160
bytes received or transmitted whatever

1102
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,160
it is right

1103
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,399
and not having this

1104
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
not being able to answer this question

1105
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,200
is really quite bad

1106
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,959
in fact like i think this is the biggest

1107
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,359
kind of the biggest thing holding back

1108
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,359
our feet

1109
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,599
now personally you know i try to ask

1110
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,760
myself questions like

1111
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,680
okay so if my budget was doubled

1112
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,160
tomorrow

1113
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,919
like how would the users notice like

1114
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,680
what can the user points to to say that

1115
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,240
okay you know their phone really got

1116
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
more secure

1117
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,440
and i like to think that i'm in the

1118
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,720
business of harm reduction

1119
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,720
right or crime prevention

1120
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,839
but i can't tell you know to what extent

1121
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,240
i'm succeeding without data like this

1122
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,119
right and so you know the automotive

1123
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,520
industry

1124
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,720
has knits a date on car fatalities that

1125
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,960
they can use to assess

1126
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,279
progress on car safety and you know the

1127
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,640
healthcare industry has cdc data

1128
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,720
on infections that they can assess

1129
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,960
improvements in disease prevention and

1130
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,279
in the security industry we have

1131
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,720
thought leaders right and for you know

1132
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
for what we lack and evidence of what

1133
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,520
works

1134
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,440
we more than make up for with like

1135
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,319
really strongly held fanatical beliefs

1136
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,560
about what should work so

1137
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,400
i can try you know we have a lot of you

1138
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,000
know we have maturity models and best

1139
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,480
practices and guidelines

1140
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
and you know i can measure adherence to

1141
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,440
those

1142
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,200
but if i do that my job is not about

1143
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,480
harm reduction you know my job is about

1144
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,759
compliance i don't want to be in

1145
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,280
compliance

1146
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,400
right you know we can look at

1147
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,560
kind of decreasing uh negative press

1148
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,119
coverage based on cve circumference

1149
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,040
talks

1150
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,240
but then my job is pr and i don't want

1151
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,119
my job to be pr

1152
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,959
right look i know great people that work

1153
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,520
in pr some of my you know friends work

1154
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,359
in pr

1155
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,960
that's just not my career choice i want

1156
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,720
to be in the business of harm reduction

1157
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,359
and for that i need to be able to

1158
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,839
measure

1159
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,759
the actual outcome of my work

1160
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,599
i know now there are things like the

1161
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,480
cyber itl

1162
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,079
right that look at you know analyze the

1163
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,520
binary or analyze the product and look

1164
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,960
at which counter measures are enabled

1165
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,319
which uh uh you know unsafe functions

1166
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,800
are still in use and so on

1167
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,319
but again those things are like uh

1168
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,359
looking at safety features right it

1169
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,119
measures effort

1170
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,480
you know how hard is a vendor trying to

1171
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,720
make their product secure

1172
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,680
it doesn't necessarily tell you what the

1173
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,680
end outcome is

1174
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,078
so in some sense kind of going back to

1175
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,160
xerodium's

1176
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,319
marketing slide in some sense this is

1177
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,359
the best feedback

1178
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,599
mechanism we have

1179
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,598
and

1180
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,520
and you know it's not a bad one but it's

1181
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,520
not ideal right like and it's

1182
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,160
sort of it's hard to tell how accurate

1183
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,759
it is um

1184
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,640
yeah so kind of i'm coming to the end

1185
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,720
here i know

1186
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,920
we don't have a lot of time so wrapping

1187
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,160
up

1188
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,280
um overall kind of you know when i look

1189
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,640
back at this slide

1190
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,760
right this is a very kind of happy

1191
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,440
optimistic slide

1192
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,839
like you know those are great numbers on

1193
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,240
the left-hand side to be looking at

1194
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,920
all right and i hope so looking at this

1195
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,000
like i hope that i've managed to deliver

1196
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,280
somewhat optimistic talk at least

1197
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,880
kind of by the security talk standards

1198
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,319
and convince you that it's not all doom

1199
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,400
and gloom

1200
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,480
that consumer products are continuously

1201
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,079
evolving and becoming more secure

1202
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,440
and that your smartphone is arguably the

1203
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,200
most secure device that you have

1204
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
um you know we can see the effect of

1205
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,240
this evolution like even our threat

1206
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,000
models are evolving right

1207
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,759
to the point that like today

1208
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,839
nation-state attackers

1209
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,599
are explicitly part of the threat model

1210
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,799
it wasn't like this

1211
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,720
it wasn't always like this it wasn't

1212
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,440
like this even you know 15 maybe even 10

1213
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,118
years ago

1214
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,599
right like i remember starting out in

1215
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,280
this industry and you know it was

1216
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,720
like an explicit position when you're

1217
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,079
you know when you're performing a

1218
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,959
security analysis when you're doing

1219
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,640
threat model

1220
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,240
you know if government attackers are out

1221
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,000
of scope because

1222
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,598
you know there's not much you can do and

1223
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,240
we've moved on since then

1224
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,160
now i'm not saying we're successfully

1225
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,598
stopping every government attacker

1226
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,078
but it's kind of it's a realistic goal

1227
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,200
it's a bar that we're actively trying to

1228
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,319
reach for

1229
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,640
and that is a huge change for the better

1230
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:52,960
so when i look at new kind of

1231
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,359
new fields like iot for example

1232
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,040
i get a sense of deja vu right because i

1233
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,799
see many of the same concerns

1234
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,560
coming up as you know what i was seeing

1235
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,000
during the early days of mobile

1236
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,520
the you know many of the same concerns

1237
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,599
that i was raising during the early days

1238
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,720
of mobile

1239
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,599
so and knowing how that turned out gives

1240
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,279
me hope

1241
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,640
right so even as i share a lot of the

1242
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,760
concerns about the

1243
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,440
state of iot security i remain very

1244
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,520
optimistic about the faith

1245
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,599
right but the prodigal that product

1246
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,040
category needs some time to mature and

1247
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,079
stabilize

1248
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,119
to evolve and then you know security of

1249
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,119
it will evolve too

1250
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,040
now the reason i think you should

1251
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,800
believe and embrace my optimistic

1252
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,640
outlook is

1253
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,839
my track record of being wrong okay that

1254
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,000
sounded a bit better in my head the

1255
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,160
first time around

1256
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,760
what i mean is it's not just sort of

1257
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,839
some random thought i had

1258
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,680
it is a conclusion based on a falsified

1259
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,160
hypothesis in fact the many years worth

1260
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,520
of falsified hypothesis

1261
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,040
because i used to believe something

1262
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,160
different and those different beliefs

1263
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,319
did not pan out

1264
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,960
right so i reconsidered them and this is

1265
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:07,920
kind of this is my new outcome

1266
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,920
so really it's science really um

1267
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,760
okay and i think that's actually it so

1268
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,279
you know those were the thoughts i

1269
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:19,599
wanted to share with you today

1270
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:23,359
um and i think we have some time for q a

1271
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,960
thanks a lot alex i was right

1272
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,720
in telling you that you could talk about

1273
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,359
anything you wanted this was a

1274
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,078
great keynote thanks for being the

1275
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,040
remaining

1276
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,720
one of the remaining optimistic security

1277
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,880
experts here in the round

1278
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,078
because we do need that at conferences

1279
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,520
and i'm totally with you

1280
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,000
thanks for doing that because i also

1281
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,000
strongly

1282
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,359
believe we are actually in a pretty good

1283
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,359
place at the moment

1284
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,200
um there's there are always things we

1285
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,960
can improve and i think we had some

1286
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,560
interesting talks these two days of

1287
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,359
where we can improve but we are

1288
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,319
starting from a from a pretty high bar

1289
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,359
already

1290
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,800
also um thanks for the douglas adams

1291
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,400
reference that's

1292
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:12,079
always a good one um

1293
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
before going through my list of

1294
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,920
questions that i

1295
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,720
wrote down during your talk we already

1296
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,599
have one

1297
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,560
in our virtual conference menu in the

1298
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,400
metro most chat from daniel thomas

1299
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,799
daniel do you want to ask yourself or

1300
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,920
shall i read

1301
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,640
i can ask it um so

1302
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,960
will iot security only come when the

1303
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,200
number of providers has consolidated to

1304
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,240
a

1305
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,680
relatively small number like with mobile

1306
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,399
devices or

1307
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,879
um say big tech companies you basically

1308
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,200
have to

1309
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,319
go with one of a small number um and

1310
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,359
therefore they have the

1311
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:52,160
reason to invest in security because

1312
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,598
things have settled down a bit or and if

1313
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,000
that is the case is there

1314
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,960
any reason it wouldn't happen with iot

1315
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,400
i'd know because of the

1316
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,640
there being so many different um

1317
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,920
application domains or do you expect

1318
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,279
that everything will consolidate behind

1319
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,839
a small number and

1320
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,200
then we'll get security yes so so that

1321
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:13,200
that's an interesting question

1322
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,759
thanks so i think the two

1323
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,040
kind of the number of providers and the

1324
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,599
level of security

1325
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,240
um kind of thinking about it off the top

1326
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,280
of my head

1327
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,799
i think there's probably some

1328
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,480
correlation there but not necessarily

1329
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,160
causation right like i think the two may

1330
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,960
be driven by the same market forces

1331
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,279
right as

1332
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,359
you know early on in the field there are

1333
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,920
lots of entrance lots of people trying

1334
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,880
different things as the field becomes

1335
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,440
mature

1336
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,240
uh it kind of tends to consolidate to a

1337
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,920
few

1338
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:46,640
uh big players and it so happens that

1339
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:50,559
kind of security evolves along excuse me

1340
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:54,480
that same um that same curve

1341
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:57,200
uh as well and

1342
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,800
i think actually the kind of the the

1343
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,720
slide i had in backup

1344
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,640
um that i accidentally should uh

1345
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,879
talks a little bit about that point

1346
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,480
maybe i'll go to it right let me just do

1347
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,960
that

1348
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,640
look uh so speaking of iot right like

1349
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,800
look these two printers

1350
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,078
uh you know a few weeks ago when i

1351
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,440
checked this right they

1352
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,079
think they offer pretty much the same

1353
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,720
set of features they have the same price

1354
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,440
um how can you tell which one is more

1355
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,959
secure

1356
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,960
or like is even secure right

1357
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,400
and you know maybe this is a counter

1358
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,760
example to what i was saying before that

1359
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,440
once the product category becomes

1360
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,000
commoditized that's when it focuses on

1361
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
security

1362
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,599
because these things are commoditized

1363
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,119
right like i don't

1364
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,480
like i think people go to the store and

1365
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,400
they just figure out okay like you know

1366
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,040
i want a printer that costs like this

1367
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,640
much or

1368
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,720
you know whatever the cheaper whatever

1369
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,000
is uh in store at costco

1370
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,439
and you just buy the printer right

1371
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,200
there's not really a lot of i think

1372
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,880
feature differentiation for home

1373
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,879
printers these days

1374
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,880
um but then the question is

1375
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,480
to what extent do consumers care right

1376
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,200
like how many of us

1377
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,880
have like our work you know have a

1378
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,558
problem with the security of our printer

1379
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,200
like can't get our work done because our

1380
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,400
printer

1381
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,000
you know is being exploited right

1382
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,200
so you know you could argue that look

1383
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you know they reach the level of

1384
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,279
security that consumers are comfortable

1385
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,119
with

1386
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,400
and you know if you made them 10 times

1387
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:30,000
more secure like nobody would notice

1388
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,680
right uh so yeah so i don't know

1389
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,359
this was kind of along with an answer

1390
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,359
i'm not sure i answered the question

1391
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,000
uh directly but i think i think we will

1392
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,759
see yes that consolidation

1393
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,520
and improvement on security that are

1394
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,839
kind of they'll go hand in hand but it's

1395
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,640
not because one is related to the other

1396
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,240
you know i think

1397
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,480
you can have many different vendors all

1398
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,078
improving security

1399
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,400
but you do have to wait for the um

1400
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,920
product category to mature uh you have

1401
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,599
to figure out what customers are

1402
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
actually comfortable with what benefit

1403
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,079
they're

1404
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,440
really looking to extract from a product

1405
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,839
and what trade-offs they're willing to

1406
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,640
make

1407
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,839
in exchange for that right and you don't

1408
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,319
know that until you try

1409
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,160
right like look i can look at uber right

1410
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,319
like uber would have something like uber

1411
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,078
would have been insane to propose

1412
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,599
like at any large corporation before

1413
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,599
uber actually watched right like

1414
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,200
look we're gonna can you imagine that

1415
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,079
conversation with the legal team

1416
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,319
like we're gonna let strangers like get

1417
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,440
into your car

1418
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,558
and it it doesn't happen right so so you

1419
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,839
have to go

1420
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,920
kind of through this evolutionary

1421
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,720
process to see what sticks what works

1422
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,920
what consumers embrace and then kind of

1423
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,919
work on securing that

1424
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:43,599
anyway

1425
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,598
coming back to your answer um at which

1426
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,480
point in your curve

1427
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,040
would you in your time curve would you

1428
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,520
put

1429
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,359
current mobile phones do you think we

1430
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,800
are already at the stage where the

1431
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:58,319
differentiating factor

1432
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:01,040
is becoming to be reliability yeah

1433
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,160
how far away from that are we no i i

1434
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,520
think for phones we

1435
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,839
i my personal take is look for

1436
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,040
for and it's not a great thing kind of

1437
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,000
from a business perspective for the

1438
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,920
industry

1439
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,520
but i think we've kind of turned that

1440
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,040
corner effectively right like you know

1441
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,480
all phones look like this

1442
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,720
right you know you don't really see

1443
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,280
lines forming around the block whenever

1444
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,000
the new

1445
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,960
you know the latest phone comes out you

1446
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,960
know people are not

1447
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,720
treating their uh you know their

1448
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,319
two-year contract as a prison sentence

1449
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,439
counting down the days to what

1450
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,000
you know when they can finally uh get a

1451
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,520
new phone

1452
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,520
at least like look for myself right

1453
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,960
that's like

1454
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,640
it works well i'm not necessarily

1455
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,960
looking forward to an upgrade i know

1456
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,759
that

1457
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,040
you know for me really the last few

1458
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,839
generations of phones

1459
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,960
like the upgrade was driven by uh you

1460
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,279
know battery life

1461
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,040
you know the battery degrading and uh

1462
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,400
screens getting broken right it wasn't

1463
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,000
because the new phone

1464
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,680
offered the features that i wanted it's

1465
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,240
because my old one stopped working

1466
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,960
so in that sense like yes reliability is

1467
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,279
already

1468
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,040
a thing and yeah like at this point i do

1469
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,480
view getting a new phone as a chore

1470
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,240
right like okay now i have to migrate

1471
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,119
all of my stuff and reset it up

1472
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,799
and again not a great thing for somebody

1473
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,240
uh kind of whose salary depends on

1474
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,359
people buying new phones

1475
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,879
but you know from a security engineering

1476
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,640
perspective i do think we turn that

1477
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,160
corner and that is why you see

1478
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,118
like i'm not naming names but you see

1479
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,160
the big kind of players in the industry

1480
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,400
kind of made a rather sharp pivot

1481
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,960
towards a kind of strong focus on

1482
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,960
security

1483
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,520
coming quickly back to your example on

1484
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,078
printers

1485
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,240
um i i fully agree that phones are

1486
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,839
becoming commodity devices these days

1487
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,720
and there is little difference in terms

1488
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,640
of features

1489
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,000
but do you think that for phones we

1490
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,400
already have

1491
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,160
the like as consumers trying to put

1492
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,079
ourselves into consumers shoes

1493
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,078
do we already have the information do we

1494
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,680
have the transparency on how to decide

1495
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,079
between the security

1496
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,839
features the security stands off

1497
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,680
multiple phones that you have in your

1498
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,558
short list of devices that you might go

1499
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,839
for

1500
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,599
for printers i agree i wouldn't

1501
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,200
know where to look for if i wanted to

1502
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,640
know if it was safe to connect that

1503
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,919
printer directly to

1504
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,040
my whatever guest network or not do i

1505
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,240
know for phones

1506
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,160
if i'm not within this community here uh

1507
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,680
no and i i think that's the same answer

1508
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,680
right like unfortunately no

1509
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,520
right and we don't have a good way and

1510
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,520
like i said i think part of it is

1511
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,040
because we don't really have

1512
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,960
this meaningful feedback function we

1513
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,079
don't have reliable crime stats what you

1514
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,400
really want to know is

1515
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,520
okay what is my likelihood of being

1516
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,200
exploited or you know

1517
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,960
losing money or whatever it is right if

1518
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,200
i buy this phone

1519
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,640
right i think we try to short circuit

1520
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,040
that and look at features

1521
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,319
but i think it doesn't necessarily work

1522
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,520
right so

1523
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:52,480
um you know the worry is

1524
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,839
that uh like it's possible to slap on a

1525
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,520
feature without actually making the

1526
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,960
device more secure right like look

1527
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:03,040
i can you know if i uh

1528
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,640
buy uh you know a cheap

1529
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,720
you know cheap phone that's based on an

1530
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,960
soc that's not from qualcomm let's say

1531
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,799
uh right and i slap a secure element to

1532
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,559
the side of it it doesn't magically make

1533
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,599
it secure right it doesn't like address

1534
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,839
the hundreds of

1535
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,520
kind of lp and rce bugs that are in

1536
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:20,558
there like that

1537
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,440
so uh kind of adding a security feature

1538
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,200
by itself

1539
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,960
right just like you know adding a safety

1540
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,240
feature to a car doesn't necessarily

1541
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,760
mean that you get the outcome that you

1542
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,598
want we have to get to the point where

1543
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,800
we're actually able to measure

1544
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,720
outcomes and look back and say okay look

1545
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,319
clearly you know you know people that

1546
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,000
have bought this type of device

1547
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,279
ended up being safer than people that

1548
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,280
bought that type of device

1549
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,720
we do have another question in our q a

1550
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,839
uh

1551
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,040
session chat you said by martin by the

1552
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,359
way you said we've

1553
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,279
we are past arguing if some bug is

1554
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,880
really going to be exploited or not

1555
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,240
what do you think is the next argument

1556
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,240
that we should move past

1557
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,200
um all right so i guess i'm going to be

1558
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,319
i'm i'm gonna keep beating that same

1559
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,558
drum i think it's

1560
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,558
um

1561
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,440
i think we spend too much time arguing

1562
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,400
about whether something is a good idea

1563
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,400
right we're like whether

1564
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,559
a certain mitigation really works or not

1565
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,839
whether um

1566
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:28,000
uh you know kind of i'm thinking of

1567
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:32,720
uh you know however flakes kind of

1568
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,720
mitigator and or kind of

1569
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,240
spender's kind of opinions on uh kind of

1570
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,240
what mitigations really work in linux

1571
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,118
and so on

1572
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,319
i think i mean they're interesting

1573
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,680
intellectual arguments they're

1574
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,880
interesting academic arguments

1575
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,078
but really we have to rely more on

1576
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,720
kind of on the evolutionary and the

1577
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,960
scientific process right

1578
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,558
you don't make progress by just by kind

1579
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,240
of thinking really hard about what's

1580
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,559
good idea

1581
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,078
and then stopping there right you have

1582
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,079
to then test it out

1583
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,000
and see if your hypothesis was correct

1584
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,599
right so again we need this

1585
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,599
feedback mechanism that will allow us to

1586
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:14,319
try lots of different things

1587
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,319
and not get hung up about kind of

1588
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,040
um kind of i could

1589
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,079
or kind of philosophical or maybe

1590
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,079
arguments about

1591
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,280
whether a certain mitigation is good or

1592
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,160
bad we should be able to look at the

1593
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,680
data and see

1594
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,279
whether that mitigation is working or

1595
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,160
not right whether it's actually making

1596
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,839
users

1597
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,839
uh safer or not

1598
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,759
i have another one which is very much

1599
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,880
connected to your

1600
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:44,960
take on reliability being one of the

1601
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,400
latest features that products aim for

1602
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,640
do you think that this curve will go

1603
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,599
down again if i look at some

1604
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,118
product categories again let's let's not

1605
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,720
talk too much about

1606
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,799
smartphones because both of us would

1607
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,839
have to talk to some lawyers maybe

1608
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:02,000
but um if i think about

1609
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,119
whatever washing machines to to take

1610
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,920
another example it

1611
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,559
probably also works for cars i feel that

1612
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,680
reliability is actually going down over

1613
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,440
the decades that

1614
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,078
maybe it was an argument that your

1615
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,599
washing machine would run for 20 years

1616
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,119
it no longer is one um at the moment we

1617
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,440
are back into the

1618
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,680
feature cycle hey this washing machine's

1619
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,200
ipv6 isn't that cool in itself wouldn't

1620
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,118
you want it because of that

1621
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:32,399
um so do you do you think that this is a

1622
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,799
a curve that saturates at some point or

1623
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,240
um based on the product category and

1624
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,960
based on whatever the current market

1625
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,040
hype is can

1626
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,160
can it actually regress back down again

1627
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,119
is that something that you

1628
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,000
that you would expect also in the mobile

1629
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,240
and iot

1630
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,200
space to to happen to to have a little

1631
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,680
bit of back and forth

1632
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,598
yeah absolutely i mean i think

1633
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,799
reliability regresses i'm not sure about

1634
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,680
security but

1635
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:57,359
i mean i i don't necessarily see kind of

1636
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,359
in terms of that curve i think it's just

1637
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,960
basically

1638
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,640
it's a second wave so to speak right you

1639
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,240
know using the terminology of today you

1640
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,759
get a second wave you get a third wave

1641
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,279
in fact i mean we already saw something

1642
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,359
like this with phones right

1643
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,280
with battery life right like you know

1644
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,200
the phone that i showed from 95 right

1645
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,960
you know back then like we had a week of

1646
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,558
battery life right that was you know

1647
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,880
you want to be able to go for a week

1648
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,559
between charges right

1649
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,559
like now we're lucky if we can last a

1650
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,400
day right and that's because

1651
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,079
obviously you know you have this kind of

1652
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,440
huge color display and a lot of other

1653
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,720
things right a much more powerful

1654
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,880
processor

1655
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:34,399
so so you have certain kind of

1656
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,400
reliability things that are

1657
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,000
they degrade because consumers embrace

1658
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,680
new

1659
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
functionality new features yeah so for

1660
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,960
washing machines somebody really wants

1661
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,520
kind of is buying a new washing machine

1662
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,720
for

1663
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,960
kind of for wi-fi connectivity uh and

1664
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,240
they're willing to kind of

1665
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:57,680
to trade longevity for it then

1666
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:01,040
uh that's what happens but again right

1667
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,919
we you know

1668
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,200
largely these are the choices we make as

1669
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,640
consumers

1670
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,160
uh right it's like in most cases like

1671
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,879
you don't have to buy the wi-fi machine

1672
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,520
right like

1673
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,480
we didn't have to use zoom uh we could

1674
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,960
have

1675
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,400
tried something more secure but then it

1676
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,400
would probably you know i probably need

1677
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,119
more than 15 minutes for the av check i

1678
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,559
don't know

1679
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,480
um alex i do

1680
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,000
fully share your concerns about the zoom

1681
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,400
client and

1682
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,400
as you so acutely mentioned at the start

1683
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,520
of your presentation there are reasons

1684
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,280
why we chose it not only because

1685
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,040
our university actually has a campus

1686
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,960
license for that which allows us to use

1687
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,880
all those features without

1688
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,880
paying from the conference budget which

1689
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,920
we don't have

1690
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,520
so yes there are reasons um

1691
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,960
if we don't see any other questions

1692
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,079
right now

1693
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:57,200
then um i would like to close

1694
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:59,520
this excellent keynote session thank you

1695
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:08,240
again alex for doing that

1696
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:08,240
it was very much appreciated
