1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,360
we have an excellent talk

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,480
from uh and aditi

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,600
bagnikar who are coming to us from

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,800
microsoft

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,560
at uh hyderabad how to bad um

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,680
so i believe that a dt is going to

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,320
uh be kicking us off with this

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,359
um are are you are you there ready to

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
get set up

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,040
thank you first of all the organizers

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,839
for giving us this opportunity to

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,399
present the world

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
and hello everyone uh who is watching

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,520
this

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
right now so today we will be talking

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,079
about the privacy posture of apps

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,440
ecosystem

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,039
particularly android and before jumping

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,599
into

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,280
the technical details of it uh let's

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,840
first introduce ourselves

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
uh i am aditi i am engineer and

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,840
researcher

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
my major interests are in technical

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,600
sociology and like passionate about

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,159
studying all the different aspects

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
in which text shapes human life uh i'm a

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,479
digital well-being advocate

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,119
and an avid blogger and with us we have

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,320
dinesh

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,680
uh yeah uh hi

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,479
all um i am dinesh i am a malwa

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,240
researcher

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,840
and i have been studying about various

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,199
security threats

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,439
for the best part of the last two

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,920
decades and i like

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,919
knowledge graphs and i am in a lifelong

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,960
pursuit of building a knowledge graph of

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
all security threats i am

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,399
very much interested in building

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,919
intelligence system that has the ability

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
to do causal inference

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,680
and we will talk more about that in our

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,639
case studies over to you other things

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,840
sure and uh thanks just beginning uh

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
with the disclaimer that all the

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,560
opinions are our own

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,720
and does not necessarily reflect that of

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,560
our employers so let's talk about the

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
functional perspective of privacy today

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
like

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,640
understanding the context as to what

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,439
privacy stands for in the real life and

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
as we go in

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,679
the presentation we will try to map it

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,479
in the digital world and talk about

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,239
the posture there so privacy is a very

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,758
basic human instinct right all of us

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
live in our homes we

61
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,760
have houses surrounded by walls we

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,400
control the doors for letting people

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,000
in and out in real world if someone asks

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
us questions like what's your exact

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
address or phone number we get

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,440
suspicious for sure

67
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
and most of us like some of us uh put

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
locks on main gates for security

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,080
purposes

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
so it's like a very basic gesture that

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,840
human beings relate to

72
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,518
and it's very contextual like privacy

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,200
for me might not be privacy for you so

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,640
definition is really abstract and i

75
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,000
think that is what makes it really

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,079
challenging to map this

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,280
humanly expectation into a digital

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,879
sphere

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
but still there are common themes

80
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,599
attached to this which we can all relate

81
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
to

82
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,518
and that's what we'll talk about first

83
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
thing is autonomy

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
so why privacy what is privacy

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
protecting

86
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
so if you think about it uh from a

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,319
perspective of

88
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,839
techno sociology you will see that it's

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,679
giving in a way it's protecting our

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
autonomy like how do we function

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
uh controlling our own lives having the

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,800
full freedom of how we choose to live

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
a life without the judgment or suspicion

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
of any

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,040
any other person whom we don't know or

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,239
people who have access to our

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,159
information

98
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
so it demarcates that personal sphere

99
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,000
from what we want

100
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,760
people to know about us and when is your

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,239
privacy actually at risk

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,079
so if so imagine that my neighbor

103
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,519
invented this elaborate extra device

104
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
that enabled

105
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,560
the person to look through the walls now

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
i would

107
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,599
say that the person has the control to

108
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,319
look at

109
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,560
the what i am doing but that essentially

110
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
doesn't you know put my privacy at risk

111
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,440
until that particular act is performed

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,279
so even if all os android or different

113
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,000
operating systems have access to a lot

114
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,799
of information until that act is done

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
it is not affecting the privacy and

116
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
secondly the most important thing is

117
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,000
that who gets to see

118
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,519
and what is it that they intend to do

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
with information that they acquired

120
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,360
so uh will it affect your autonomy if

121
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,399
anyone is taking details from your

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
devices

123
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,840
i would say it would affect it if it is

124
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,319
affecting how you live

125
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,120
your real life right so examples of it

126
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,599
would be like

127
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,720
uh if someone is taking details from my

128
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,639
device and then

129
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
presenting me information which can

130
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
possibly manipulate

131
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
my thought process then yes it is

132
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,040
affecting my privacy

133
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,559
another thing would be like suppose some

134
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,600
app sitting on my device collects some

135
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,759
information

136
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
and it's passed on to some servers which

137
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,400
is deciding whether i will get a loan or

138
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
not

139
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,320
so there's data flowing out of my device

140
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,198
and that data is being used for my

141
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,919
credibility

142
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,440
uh or my judgment of whether i should be

143
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
given a loan or not then yes it will be

144
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
affecting the privacy

145
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
and similarly it goes with surveillance

146
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
so if we know that okay someone is

147
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
watching through the webcams all the

148
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,880
time the way people will behave will be

149
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,039
restricted and

150
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
that will definitely affect the way you

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,479
live right so

152
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,120
this is how if you do a technical

153
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
mapping privacy will get affected if

154
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
things are leaked from a system which we

155
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,240
don't want to so now mapping it into the

156
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,639
digital spheres let's talk about what

157
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,800
happens in android world

158
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,400
from technical standard standpoint or

159
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
privacy platforms you usually try to

160
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,120
ensure two things

161
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
first is that the users have all the

162
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,080
control to provide or revoke consent on

163
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
sharing data

164
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,039
so they should have the control in

165
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
android usually it comes in the form of

166
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
permissions

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,360
and second is that the platforms itself

168
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,120
is secure

169
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,039
so you ensure that the data reaches only

170
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,880
to the legitimate consumers and is

171
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,639
handled with proper care

172
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
so let's talk about the first and then

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,360
deep dive into the second

174
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,520
so if you have an android phone or what

175
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,840
is it that you can control

176
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,440
so typically i use user android phone

177
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,039
can control first of all the apps that

178
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
get to live on the device

179
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,280
now uh this is under our control most of

180
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,000
the times apart from the cases where the

181
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,119
app is

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
uh a system app so it's coming with your

183
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
phone or

184
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,600
if the app is mandatory by the law of

185
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,880
land in those cases you don't have

186
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
control but other than that

187
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,800
you always have the right to decide what

188
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,318
app is installed

189
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
then the permission that that app can

190
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,960
take that can also be regulated by the

191
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
user

192
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
and the configuration changes that the

193
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,560
app can make so suppose extending on the

194
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,159
accessibility service or device admins

195
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
those things can be controlled by going

196
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
to settings

197
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,080
uh and then deciding the controls for

198
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
that particular feature

199
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,280
but now let's talk about what a user

200
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
cannot control so

201
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,159
most of the users android users have

202
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
this thing that if i'm giving a

203
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
permission then

204
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,080
uh i know okay this is going out of my

205
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,240
device but what is the real scenario

206
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,240
so info can go out even without any

207
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,039
permission and uh here's a small

208
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,319
john small app that we made so this

209
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,318
particular app has

210
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,400
not even a single permission uh not even

211
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,720
the normal permissions that android

212
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,080
can take without user intervention

213
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
android app can take without user

214
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,719
intervention but let's see what all this

215
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,000
app can get

216
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,880
from the device so

217
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,599
here is a john snow app which knows

218
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,919
which we think

219
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,360
knows nothing and there's no permission

220
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,880
given to this app

221
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,880
and no other explicit settings

222
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,198
now when i go to the app and ask what do

223
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,919
you know now it will tell me

224
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,720
you have the google pixel 3 basic device

225
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,960
details

226
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
the apis the boot loader all the digital

227
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
details which

228
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,120
which is i think okay fine if they know

229
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,159
then they would know whether adb is

230
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,080
enabled or not or

231
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
usb mass storage is enabled or whether

232
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,359
my wi-fi is on or not

233
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
they'll know what kind of accessibility

234
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,039
services i'm using um

235
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,719
what are my preferences is there any

236
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,880
parental control

237
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
on my device they would also know all

238
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,639
the apps which are sitting on

239
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,120
my device now essentially every app that

240
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,360
i use has a trait associated to it

241
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
if i'm using an htmc bank app it means

242
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
that okay i don't use that

243
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,800
but if i use that app it means that this

244
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
is my bank account right most of the

245
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
cases similarly if you use any other app

246
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
basically it is a characteristic trait

247
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,878
which can be used and any app on android

248
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,360
can get access to that all the different

249
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,000
apps which are sitting on your platform

250
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
then we ask is there anything more that

251
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,240
you can know

252
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,680
so this is the question we ask next and

253
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,400
let's see what is the answer so

254
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,199
further i can tell uh when will my alarm

255
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
trigger next

256
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,520
when will i wake up next uh according to

257
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,560
alarm am i listening to a song right now

258
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,120
is my microphone

259
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,280
on mute it's my battery charging what is

260
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,160
the last text that i copied

261
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,878
uh which is according to me an important

262
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,840
information

263
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,240
if you use copy paste in mails or chats

264
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,159
this app will be having access to it

265
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
then the sensors and all the app widgets

266
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
that i'm using

267
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,880
so this is information that this app

268
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
which practically has no

269
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,120
permissions uh can get from the system

270
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,199
and i'm like i'm very sure

271
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,640
there's a lot more to it it's it's the

272
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
first trial of

273
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
uh conducting this experiment and the

274
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,160
normal permissions uh

275
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,080
are all these permissions that you can

276
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,839
see on the screen are

277
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,200
normal permissions which mean that user

278
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,440
doesn't have to give constant on this

279
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
permissions but still this data can be

280
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,279
accessed from the device and this is

281
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,479
like a lot more comprehensive than what

282
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,160
we have just seen so

283
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
including the wi-fi network the mac

284
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,199
addresses and everything

285
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,439
uh which we can get using these

286
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
permissions

287
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,519
so things that this community lead to is

288
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,240
firstly user profiling as we

289
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,080
see that as we just saw that you know in

290
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
apps every app is a trade so if

291
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,200
an app is able to collect all these

292
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,640
things um the app would definitely know

293
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
about my digital habits

294
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,040
how often do i open my phone and things

295
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,640
like that and all that can definitely

296
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,640
lead to user profiling in fact there has

297
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,959
been significant research which you can

298
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,560
see uh quoted on the powerpoint where

299
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
they were able to clearly find out the

300
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,880
gender of the person ethnicity of the

301
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,399
person

302
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,080
and different things related to that

303
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,040
person so personal traits of the person

304
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
can be figured out

305
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
just on the basis of this information

306
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
and the second thing it can lead to is

307
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
device fingerprinting which is a notion

308
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,640
very common in web

309
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
uh where we try to think up in the

310
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
browsers but in android that surface

311
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
just

312
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
increases so it's a lot of data points

313
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,080
on which you can easily figure out

314
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,599
uh that this device is unique

315
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
now let's shift to focus a little bit on

316
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
the alternate angle of looking at

317
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,040
privacy so when you give access to it is

318
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
it that you're just permitting excess

319
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
for your data

320
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
so humans are interconnected and so is

321
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
our data there's no

322
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
you know isolated zones and data so when

323
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,720
you give access to your contacts

324
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,120
uh or you know location or different

325
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,160
uh things that you choose to share that

326
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,320
same information

327
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,439
includes your family or friends contacts

328
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,360
and photos as well

329
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,200
so that also goes away similarly when i

330
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,160
choose to share my location or

331
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,839
wi-fi state the my flatmates location

332
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,079
and wi-fi state also goes away so it's

333
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,959
kind of interlinked

334
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,560
um so similarly so the problems that

335
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,239
privacy and security researchers usually

336
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,000
see in this domain is the curious case

337
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
of crowdsourcing where say

338
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,040
we have alice and we have bob and alice

339
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
shares her

340
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,439
number with bob and then bob installs

341
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,959
some app uh which sticks that number and

342
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,959
put it on cloud

343
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,119
alice gets to know about that uh

344
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,800
information that it's on the cloud and

345
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
she gets disappointed that it's on the

346
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
cloud so she raises a request

347
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,160
that hey just take this information away

348
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,560
from the cloud because

349
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,839
this is my personal uh pii this is my

350
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
personal information

351
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,160
but again if you know third person comes

352
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,760
uh here carol and bob shares the contact

353
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
with carol now carol

354
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,279
chooses to upload the information uh

355
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,880
they don't exactly choose but suppose

356
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,640
they have some app that

357
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,399
took the permission and shared it on the

358
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,399
cloud again that would

359
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,920
lead to the same info same problem and

360
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
alice will be disappointed

361
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
that her data is on the cloud so

362
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,920
basically there is it's a thought

363
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,680
provoking question on how do we approach

364
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
such kind of problems because

365
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,199
there's no clear well-defined solution

366
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,959
on how do you want to tackle this kind

367
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
of situation can a person actually

368
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
control

369
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,680
what amount of his or her information is

370
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,279
on the cloud so that is getting

371
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,040
challenging

372
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,519
the other question that we touched upon

373
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,959
was like who gets to look at the data

374
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,800
now i'm not saying that we just should

375
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,119
not share any data that's not possible

376
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,639
if i want to use map apps obviously i

377
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
have to share my location because

378
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
the utility will be provided using the

379
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,279
location so

380
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,360
apps that need context uh to perform

381
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,480
legitimate apps which handle the data

382
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,040
with care definitely

383
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
we share and we assume it's secure

384
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,800
because we trust into the

385
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,160
system and the owner of the app uh the

386
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,920
people who build the app

387
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,000
second thing comes is the ad libraries

388
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,240
which are into legitimate apps so

389
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,240
because of the premium version uh of

390
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,320
model of revenue in android

391
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,320
the apps will give you services but it

392
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
won't ask you to pay so they use that

393
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
services and

394
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
we trust those services so in both first

395
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
and second case

396
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
uh the things will go wrong until and

397
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,959
unless the data is not handled

398
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,319
uh rightly there have been significant

399
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,638
policy uh

400
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,680
changes and introductions to make sure

401
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
that data

402
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,880
passed to these are handled with care

403
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,760
but things like

404
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,760
programmatic bugs bugs in your program

405
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,920
putting information in logs or

406
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
handling the data wrongly or if the data

407
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,599
servers themselves are in attack

408
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,560
then definitely we lose outer privacy in

409
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
those two cases

410
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
but the third one is what we are

411
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
interested in and what we will be more

412
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
uh covering in the technical details in

413
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
coming slides which is

414
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,320
adware embedded in pua and pha so the

415
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
first

416
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
two uh are like they try to use the

417
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,199
right

418
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
ways of getting the information but the

419
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,240
poas or eigs that we study they

420
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
cross the margin and try to get access

421
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,760
to data which they don't

422
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
have the permission to access through

423
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
indirect ways or

424
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,399
uh shitty ways as to say them and then

425
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,279
third fourth thing comes

426
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,680
uh surveillance where they can also get

427
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
to

428
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,279
see which is a combination of privacy

429
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
and security threats but it's an ongoing

430
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,680
discussion and

431
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:33,200
out of scope for this presentation

432
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,000
so uh yeah so this is kind of covering

433
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,639
the different kind of

434
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,560
privacy threats that we just discussed a

435
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,880
little bit more details on them

436
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,479
and uh with that with having that

437
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,639
context of

438
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,240
privacy and its mapping with digital

439
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
sphere let's switch into the technical

440
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
perspective of the presentation

441
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,519
where we'll be talking about the

442
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
vulnerabilities exploited in privacy

443
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,600
threats

444
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,600
so over to dinesh

445
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,839
sure uh thanks aveti could you please

446
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,199
move to the next slide

447
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,680
sure yeah so

448
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,959
in this uh section we will talk about uh

449
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,000
some of the previously

450
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,040
um unknown tricks which were

451
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,040
deployed in pos and phas and some of the

452
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,279
cases where pocs

453
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
so we will stay we will first begin with

454
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,839
um

455
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,000
an an exploitation of a boundary

456
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,440
condition check

457
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,160
and how it helps a pua

458
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,480
to attain a certain privilege which

459
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,399
otherwise would not have been possible

460
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,399
before diving deep into the concept

461
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,600
let's talk about some of the background

462
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,480
details

463
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,040
in android if an application wants to

464
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
draw

465
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,599
a window that has to appear on top of

466
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,000
every single app

467
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,720
it has to acquire a special permission

468
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,880
called system alert window

469
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:56,000
and and and all the system windows have

470
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,600
certain numbers associated with it

471
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
if it is an error window there is a

472
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
number uh 2003

473
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,719
if it is a phone type window there is a

474
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,639
number

475
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,880
and what happens here is in the

476
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,760
implementation there was a flaw

477
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,760
the lower bounds condition was not being

478
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,480
checked in the implementation

479
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,800
hence ah some of the pues in the past

480
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
have

481
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,680
utilized that unknown vulnerability and

482
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,440
they have set the value pass the window

483
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,479
type value as 0

484
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,079
so that the system draws it as a system

485
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,720
alert window value

486
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
so using this vulnerability the puas

487
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
were able to

488
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,639
draw a system alert window without

489
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,239
having the necessity to get the system

490
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,360
alert window permission from the users

491
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,240
this was already fixed and

492
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,839
let's see a demo in action aditi could

493
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,120
you please move to the next slide

494
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,720
yes yeah

495
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,920
so as you could see here um so

496
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,560
the the device has two applications one

497
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,399
to show

498
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,680
how the permission will generally look

499
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,800
so this is a harmless

500
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,479
app so it will require draw

501
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,639
over other apps that's the explicit

502
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,519
permission it will ask from the user if

503
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:16,000
it has to draw over other apps

504
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,959
but now we see an app which uses this

505
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,040
exploit so you could see there is no

506
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,119
permission requested from the user

507
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,519
but still it will have the ability to

508
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,600
draw a system alert window

509
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,040
so now this is a system alert window

510
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
where it will appear on top of

511
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,319
everything else

512
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,120
so the user will not be able to use the

513
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,199
device as long as

514
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,759
the other coercion happens in the

515
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,758
background

516
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
please move to the next slide

517
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,680
another unknown trick is

518
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,880
some of the poas they were creating

519
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,040
a user experience issue

520
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,240
by creating a flood of permission

521
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
requests

522
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,480
so again before talking deep into the

523
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,400
details let's talk about the background

524
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,079
of this functionality

525
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,679
from android 6.0 onwards a new dynamic

526
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,879
permission model was introduced in

527
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
android

528
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,600
so that all the apps will no longer get

529
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
the permissions during the installation

530
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,280
time

531
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
instead the permissions will be sought

532
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,000
from the user

533
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,639
as the app runs so the

534
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,440
condition for this dynamic permission

535
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,760
model

536
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,559
to be active in the devices the apps has

537
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,840
to target

538
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,760
at least 23 and above api level

539
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,840
um so when when an app tries to

540
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,679
access the dynamic permission model it

541
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,320
will pop up a window

542
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,960
giving a rational for the reason why the

543
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,200
permission is required from the user

544
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,880
and this pop-up is done by the system

545
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,240
level apis

546
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,480
so there was an implementation bug

547
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,880
in the way the permission request is

548
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,480
transmitted to the user

549
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,080
so using that an app can trigger a flood

550
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,240
of permission requests

551
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,000
which floods the screen of the device

552
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,280
and eventually the user ends up

553
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,480
clicking on the allow button so yeah

554
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,480
we will see the demo here

555
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,080
so as you could see there is a flood of

556
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,678
requests uh instead of uh

557
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,439
showing two requests uh the

558
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:33,039
the pue keeps coming up with the new

559
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,480
dynamic permission request flood

560
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,400
irrespective of whether the user clicks

561
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
hello or deny as long as it is allowed

562
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
and the

563
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,840
next action is performed it will

564
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,840
continue to pop up even if you close the

565
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
app

566
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
next slide please again this issue was

567
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,399
also fixed

568
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,520
and this is how the fix has actually

569
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
happened

570
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,480
and the fix was implemented with the

571
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,039
introduction of a private

572
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
boolean flag m has current permission

573
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,520
request

574
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,760
and as as long as this flag is set

575
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,679
the system will understand that already

576
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,760
there is a permission request

577
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,200
going on so there is no point in

578
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,720
allowing another

579
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,080
pop-up to happen however

580
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,000
this this this hurdle was also

581
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,720
circumvented by the

582
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,480
previous and phas we will talk more

583
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,679
about it in the next slide

584
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,160
with some background information so this

585
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,280
trick

586
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,000
is not entirely unknown uh however

587
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,120
the actual exploit is not unknown or

588
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,280
documented

589
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,239
so the root of the problem is with the

590
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,678
reflection

591
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,880
um so a long time ago

592
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,559
when we were young in the industry we

593
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,720
just noticed uh

594
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,639
this this behavior that we can use

595
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
reflection to access private data

596
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
structures

597
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,360
of of the programming language so being

598
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,520
curious

599
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
we reached out to a forum and asked is

600
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
it not a violation

601
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,479
and of course it was working by design

602
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,959
by then

603
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,039
but we kept tracking this and how it

604
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,240
evolves

605
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,760
next slide please so

606
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,880
uh in jdk 9 eventually after

607
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,559
10 years the access to the

608
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,159
reflection is now made as an uh warning

609
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,840
behavior like if we run the program with

610
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,360
accessing internal data structures of

611
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,959
sdk apis

612
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,600
it will throw you a warning and in

613
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,200
future releases it will get removed

614
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,520
next slide please so this shows

615
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,919
when the same program is executed using

616
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,720
the recent jdk you could see the warning

617
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,200
and when it is executed using the older

618
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,679
jdk it simply runs well

619
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,679
now how does it relate to us and the

620
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,960
topic being discussed

621
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,400
so from android 9 onwards

622
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,440
the same behavior is implemented where

623
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,559
certain apis internal variables

624
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,919
methods were prohibited from being

625
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:10,158
accessed or modified via reflection

626
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:13,520
we will talk about the circumvention now

627
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,960
so now what has happened the m has a

628
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,320
current permission flag is accessed via

629
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,520
reflection

630
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,480
and manipulated so that even though the

631
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,918
flag is already set the flag is reset to

632
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,000
false

633
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,640
so that the permission flood is

634
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,640
triggered again

635
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,000
we will see that in action now so this

636
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,520
is a android

637
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,840
device running 8.1 and

638
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,679
it is having that fix already baked into

639
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,639
the platform

640
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,280
however uh they're using reflection the

641
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,760
flag is

642
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,639
altered and hence the permission flood

643
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,360
happens in the

644
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,480
fixed version as well again this is also

645
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,600
now fixed

646
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,520
it is no longer a threat but

647
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,678
some of the devices older devices which

648
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,440
doesn't receive the update will continue

649
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,280
to get

650
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,480
facing this issue so with that

651
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,678
i will hand over to aditi to talk about

652
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,320
the rest of the vulnerabilities

653
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,919
yeah thanks donation um so uh talking

654
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,720
about the next one uh which is

655
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,240
exploiting broadcast receivers leak now

656
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
uh most of us would be familiar with

657
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,080
safe mode right like whenever

658
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,840
there is some unusual activity on my

659
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,360
phone i'll go to the id admin and say

660
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,199
what's happening the person would say

661
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,199
rebooted in the safe mode and we expect

662
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,799
that that malicious code won't execute

663
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,480
anymore because safe mode has to be

664
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,240
implemented in that way

665
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,159
but there was a vulnerability in the

666
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,760
device admin a receiver

667
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,640
in android so apparently

668
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,760
in the pha the potentially harmful

669
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,080
application

670
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,799
registers itself as a device admin for

671
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,600
the app

672
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,720
and even when the the mobile is rebooted

673
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,480
in the safe mode

674
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,799
when we try to deactivate that device

675
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,720
admin a callback goes to that app

676
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,400
and gives an opportunity or window to

677
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:09,760
execute malicious code

678
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:12,320
so let's see how it happens

679
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,200
so here i'm rebooting the phone in safe

680
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,678
mode i already have the app installed

681
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,000
which is a potentially harmful app which

682
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,720
is causing trouble on the device

683
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
so you can see it's in the safe mode on

684
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,240
the

685
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
left lower bottom

686
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,120
okay so i go to the settings and then

687
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,679
and i take try to take the

688
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,039
device this particular app out of the

689
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
device admin

690
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,840
configuration

691
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,159
now when i click on deactivate and the

692
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,080
ideal behavior is just

693
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,200
deactivate the app and don't give the

694
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,720
control to the app

695
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
but here in this case the control goes

696
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,320
to the app and again it's able to pop up

697
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,679
the window so this is pretty naive not

698
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,520
doing anything but

699
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,279
in the actual case and the admirers were

700
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,360
able to do malicious

701
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,200
things in that window of opportunity uh

702
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,799
this bug is again fixed in the latest

703
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
version of android and we don't see it

704
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,918
anymore

705
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,799
then there was another very interesting

706
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,360
trick which was uh exploiting the string

707
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,720
so the apps have the android label thing

708
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,479
right which decides the

709
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,880
uh name so this vulnerability basically

710
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,080
made that value of the label too huge

711
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,320
that the package manager

712
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,158
the package installer which uh maintains

713
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,879
the installation and uninstallation of

714
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,880
app

715
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,120
through an error and we are unable to

716
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,320
remove the app from the device

717
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,320
so here is a demo for that

718
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,559
so on the right you can see the long

719
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,760
string which we set as a label name

720
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,158
and on the left we are trying to

721
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,200
uninstall the app

722
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,400
and we see that

723
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,440
we get a warning it's not uninstalled so

724
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,120
this is the prompt from the

725
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
installer and then it has a stopped

726
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
because the issue occurred because of

727
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,159
the

728
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,399
huge text string of the label

729
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,520
of the app so such kind of things are

730
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,520
being exploited

731
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,200
uh this is also fixed but these things

732
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,240
have been exploited and this is how they

733
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,159
try to get

734
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,600
to stay on the system doing things that

735
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,480
they want to which is

736
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,760
definitely in contrast to what we would

737
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
want to

738
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,480
uh what we would want on the system so

739
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,640
those are about the vulnerabilities now

740
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,440
let's uh jump to a different section

741
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,600
which is client

742
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,360
collusion which is like a really active

743
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,559
topic of research we have had great

744
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,799
talks on this topic

745
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,320
uh even yesterday and briefly we would

746
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,200
want to touch upon the approach that we

747
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,439
used to

748
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
uh see this so what is client-side

749
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,559
collusion essentially it's like

750
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,159
two apps talking but they shouldn't be

751
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,000
talking so uh

752
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,600
rephrasing it we all know the concept of

753
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
permission redelegation

754
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,039
so it's like i have an app which takes

755
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,320
my location permission i have another

756
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,000
app which doesn't take my location

757
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,240
permission but the other app has my

758
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,480
location now how does that happen so we

759
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,880
see this very commonly that two apps can

760
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,600
talk

761
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
on android using different things either

762
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,678
uh

763
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,279
you know the site channels as was talked

764
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,080
about um

765
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,880
in the paper 50 ways to leak the app by

766
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,439
search

767
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,200
or otherwise we can have uh you know

768
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
direct ways of communication like you

769
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,279
do content providers or you do

770
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,640
broadcasts so those are like valid quiz

771
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,039
which are allowed through android and

772
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,120
two apps can use that to communicate

773
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,559
and share the data which is allowed only

774
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,399
by permission

775
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,399
so how apps interact with each other

776
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
that got as curious and uh we wanted to

777
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,080
find out different ways in which we can

778
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,760
actually figure this thing out

779
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,360
so the challenges that come is that if

780
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,879
you try to do static analysis of the

781
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,120
code the obfuscation of

782
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,880
sometimes is so heavy that it's really

783
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,439
and we are unable to fix

784
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,120
make sense of it that okay these things

785
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
is calling the content providers and

786
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,639
sending it to the other app

787
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,360
so it gets tricky how do we actually

788
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,000
ensure it

789
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,399
um that these two apps are talking other

790
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
than

791
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,720
you know the different approaches of

792
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,320
studying network traffic and then

793
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,159
reverse engineering the apps

794
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,720
is there a different way in which we can

795
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,559
find out two apps are talking

796
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
so the approaches that we took to study

797
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,000
these kind of client-side collusion

798
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,039
cases was first the sneak peek into the

799
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,039
binder calls

800
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,039
and another one is the graphical way

801
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,360
which the nation will talk about

802
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,200
so uh let's talk about the binder calls

803
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,520
that's android right every inter process

804
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,440
communication goes through binder

805
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,679
which sits right in the kernel so

806
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,200
irrespective of code obfuscation if any

807
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,039
two apps are interacting

808
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
binder will always know so whether it's

809
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,000
through content provider or broadcast or

810
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,640
anything else

811
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,200
the the binder is the person who would

812
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
know it

813
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
right so now the question comes that can

814
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,240
we know what binder knows

815
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,080
so it turns out that yes we can know it

816
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,279
on a rooted system though so either

817
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,120
you need emulator or a rooted device um

818
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,159
when you go to this particular path the

819
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,918
sys slash kernel debug binder proc

820
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,679
we see that there are a lot of log files

821
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,080
which look like this uh

822
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,000
the text that appears on the screen uh

823
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,879
there's something called prox 770 which

824
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,720
is kind of clear

825
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,039
that 770 is a pid here then we have

826
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,840
some rows with node starting from node

827
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,039
and then

828
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,959
we have other rows which are starting

829
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,360
from reference so it turns out that the

830
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,679
node

831
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,678
uh the rules which start with node are

832
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,520
the nodes being owned by this process

833
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,600
and the reference ones are the nodes

834
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
which are owned by some other process

835
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,918
and being

836
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,919
referred by this particular process

837
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,480
so uh having this information

838
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,120
uh yeah so we try to conduct an

839
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,679
experiment

840
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,399
on can we find information out from

841
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,960
these

842
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,039
dumped logs now the problem here was

843
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,520
like pids keep on changing

844
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,120
and they change it's not that you kill

845
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,879
the app and resume and the pid changes

846
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,719
pid just keeps on changing

847
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,039
in between like when the app is working

848
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,320
as well without any uh

849
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,559
you know switch in the experience of the

850
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
user so if pid keeps on changing your

851
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,158
entire logic of finding out which app

852
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,918
talks to whom will fail

853
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,760
so the approach that we took here was

854
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,960
like keep pulling the data

855
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,840
so we get all the uh proc files and we

856
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,399
get the

857
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,879
output of the command psa which tells us

858
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,959
which

859
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
package has what pid at this particular

860
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,279
point of time

861
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,120
and then we try to uh figure it out as

862
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,240
to who's talking to whom

863
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,239
so here's a demo for that

864
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,880
so it's a basic bash script and a python

865
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,639
script

866
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,559
uh so we see that the interactions

867
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,960
folder is empty uh

868
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,639
on the right side we have this adb shell

869
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,600
we have a device attached the device is

870
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,000
rooted

871
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,879
now we do the adb shell let's have a

872
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,360
look at what is

873
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,039
in the path we just talked about so when

874
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,520
we go to the path we see a lot of log

875
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,158
files

876
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,520
we picked up proc but the other folders

877
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,640
which is the state stats are equally

878
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,000
interesting

879
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,320
in proc we see all these uh things

880
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
these are basically files uh the number

881
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,918
is the process id

882
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,440
and when we open this file uh it looks

883
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,960
like the one that we just talked about

884
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,919
in the slide before

885
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,360
similarly when we do psa we get the pid

886
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,840
and the name of the

887
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,879
service or app or process which is

888
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,879
executing

889
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,320
which is having that pid at that

890
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,200
particular point of time

891
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,360
so we get output of this this command

892
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,520
and we get all the profiles

893
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,520
and then we try to run the script

894
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,720
so once i run the script we'll see that

895
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,360
it will fetch everything and

896
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,360
try to make sense of it so this is the

897
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,158
output that we get

898
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,840
uh every file is basically a process

899
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,399
same and then when we open it

900
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,360
we see what are the other services or

901
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,559
processes

902
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,120
that this particular app or services

903
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,120
talking to

904
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,120
so like for system server it talks to

905
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,240
most of the things

906
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,918
so you'll see a huge list here and these

907
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,279
are the things which is talking to

908
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,960
so we found a really interesting

909
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,600
approach to study these kind of

910
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,600
collusions

911
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,279
uh the final results of what we found

912
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,959
we'll be publishing it soon

913
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,880
uh the other way is the graphical way

914
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,559
which dinesh will talk about

915
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,679
ah thanks adriti uh so before

916
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,240
we talk about uh the approach we have

917
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,840
taken

918
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,120
uh i would like to talk um a few minutes

919
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,840
about the concept of knowledge graph

920
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,840
next slide please

921
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,279
yeah so knowledge graph as most of us

922
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,540
know

923
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,960
is has has been a very famous

924
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,080
[Music]

925
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,320
technique ever since 2014

926
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,918
when google has popularized it as a

927
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,918
concept

928
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,760
so it is basically an elegant way to

929
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,080
consume graph shaped

930
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
data when i say graph shape data they

931
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,480
are basically triples

932
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,640
um having two entities sharing a

933
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,760
relationship between them

934
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,640
and the whole idea is to represent uh

935
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,840
the entire knowledge about parsing an

936
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,880
apk

937
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,080
and documenting its behavior and

938
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,120
its static relationships and properties

939
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,519
in the form of nodes and edges

940
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,320
so that so that we we create deeper

941
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,600
connections

942
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,000
between among this structured data and

943
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,080
that really helps us from data to

944
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,360
information to knowledge to wisdom

945
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,480
path for example uh since as i have told

946
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,320
in the introduction slide

947
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,519
this will be very useful in castle

948
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,519
inference

949
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,200
let's take a very simple example of

950
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,000
between difference between fact and

951
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,000
truth so often the intelligent system

952
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,519
is able to derive intelligence and how

953
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,399
do we differentiate and provide

954
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,480
reasoning

955
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,678
for example this three plus two that

956
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,640
equals five

957
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,799
uh it's it's a fact whereas the reverse

958
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,679
is not actually a fact it is only a

959
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,559
truth

960
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,600
5 is equal to 3 plus 2 can can also be 5

961
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,918
is equal to

962
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,918
4 plus 1 or 7 minus 2 to infinite base

963
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,320
so how do we differentiate these things

964
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,120
it is not only about similarity analysis

965
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,720
it is all about a combination of many

966
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,399
things like similarity analysis

967
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,080
dissimilarity analysis

968
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,120
to track the evolution of how a poa

969
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,320
grows or evolves from one variant to

970
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,320
another variant

971
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,879
within the same family how different

972
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,918
variants behave and things like that

973
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,840
so the essential point here is

974
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,960
with the proliferation of data in all

975
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,600
the fields

976
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,720
the answers are everywhere the answers

977
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,439
are not a problem

978
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,600
anymore it is all about asking right

979
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,080
questions and knowledge graph is one

980
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,279
such

981
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,879
means to enable researchers to ask right

982
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,120
questions

983
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,919
or navigate them navigate the resources

984
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,840
to ask

985
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,159
right questions next slide please

986
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,600
so uh as you could see we will also show

987
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,200
you a live demo

988
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,000
um that the apk is parsed

989
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,039
along with reinforced behavioral data as

990
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,320
well

991
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,000
with a node and relationships and you

992
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,918
could clearly see in this case

993
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,600
two samples each having some specific

994
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,159
attributes and some shared attributes

995
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,799
so the specific attributes are well just

996
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,760
here because these are like adware

997
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,960
that means add ad lib embedded

998
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,079
applications

999
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,720
so the specific attributes that that you

1000
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,480
see

1001
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:27,439
is corresponding to the application code

1002
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,520
whereas the shared genome that you see

1003
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,760
is the add sdk attributes

1004
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,879
so between these two apps the only

1005
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,520
similarity is

1006
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,759
the genes that share that comes from the

1007
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,040
advertisement sdks

1008
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,440
let's quickly show you a demo like how

1009
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,320
this also can enable tracking

1010
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,520
intelligence

1011
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,100
and evolution of the samples and

1012
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,159
variants

1013
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,520
[Music]

1014
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,079
so for this demo purpose we are using um

1015
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,680
a fantastic open source project called

1016
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,400
kelly

1017
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,598
so generally this knowledge graph is

1018
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,599
consumed

1019
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,640
better in an efficient manner through

1020
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,320
the client

1021
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,759
through the command line version i mean

1022
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,640
kelly also has

1023
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,920
many python bindings javascript bindings

1024
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,839
and things like that

1025
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,520
but for better demonstration purpose we

1026
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,320
are switching to the visualization mode

1027
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,839
so as you could see in the screen here

1028
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,440
currently we have plotted

1029
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,560
two samples in the graph format

1030
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,880
and and as i

1031
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,640
as i have emphasized it is not only

1032
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,520
about what are the common things that

1033
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,160
gets shared

1034
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,839
between these two variants so i think

1035
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,879
we've lost your screen

1036
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,880
put this back oh okay

1037
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,520
uh so you want to share the screen or

1038
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,160
we'll continue on this yeah thanks i

1039
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,720
think

1040
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,799
okay i think i cannot start screen share

1041
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:59,839
while the other participant is sharing

1042
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,839
can you close the screenshot

1043
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,480
okay yeah

1044
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,720
okay so yeah let me start uh the

1045
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,560
execution

1046
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,040
so let's switch to the visualization

1047
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,200
mode and we are plotting two samples in

1048
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,160
graph format and as i emphasized

1049
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,279
it is not only about the things the

1050
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
attributes

1051
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,280
or the behavior that these two samples

1052
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,040
share in common

1053
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,480
some of the significant things can come

1054
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,560
from the difference as well

1055
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,160
what is the dissimilarity index between

1056
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,560
these two samples

1057
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,160
you could see this sample is almost

1058
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,560
similar with the other sample

1059
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,920
with the only difference being voice

1060
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,240
recognition sdk

1061
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,839
now for a researcher this is an

1062
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,640
interesting piece of information

1063
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,400
more than the similarity it gives an

1064
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,960
indication that the sample has

1065
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,920
evolved to add voice recognition

1066
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,240
capability

1067
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,040
so we may want to do a deeper analysis

1068
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,680
for this

1069
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,560
so in a larger system this becomes very

1070
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,839
useful

1071
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:22,400
and we will show you a quick demo before

1072
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:23,759
we hand over to other sessions so as you

1073
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,400
could see the properties

1074
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,160
how they are intervened and the

1075
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,720
similarity and dissimilarity index is

1076
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,720
calculated

1077
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,359
so with that i will again hand over to

1078
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,320
ajithi to talk about

1079
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,359
some of the privacy improving evolutions

1080
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,000
that has happened in

1081
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,920
android over the past 10 years that has

1082
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,839
significantly improved

1083
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,839
the privacy landscape

1084
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:07,520
i hope the slide is visible

1085
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,520
just navigating one second

1086
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:14,400
[Laughter]

1087
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,880
so yeah so we just saw what all kind of

1088
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,320
things we can get from knowledge graph

1089
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,720
and that ends the client site collision

1090
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,320
uh

1091
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,959
techniques section the things which can

1092
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,000
happen

1093
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,960
uh the advantages that it gives us uh

1094
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,599
in the case are

1095
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,000
being discussed so the first one is for

1096
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,000
sure

1097
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,400
uh the obfuscation kind of you can you

1098
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,960
know uh not worry about that

1099
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,240
because you'll get to know if if two

1100
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,839
apps are talking

1101
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,520
but yeah there are other problems that

1102
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,640
you would need to automate the

1103
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,599
operations on the app

1104
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,200
and you would need rooted devices or

1105
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,160
emulators

1106
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,560
so um that was the conclusion and now

1107
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,960
let's

1108
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,240
jump into the section uh evolution that

1109
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,359
improved privacy

1110
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,040
so uh google has been very active and

1111
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,319
has added a lot of

1112
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,599
amazing uh things uh in the android's

1113
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,440
ecosystem which has helped

1114
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,359
uh prevent most of the things that we

1115
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,480
talked about in the previous slides

1116
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,880
especially

1117
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,880
uh the cases of like proc fs access

1118
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,160
denial so previously like any app can

1119
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,560
access the proc

1120
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,000
uh files and you will get to know about

1121
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,359
your network details

1122
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,680
uh what all internet connections you

1123
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,400
made because the tcp log was also there

1124
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,879
and your arc cache was there so those

1125
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,839
files

1126
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,119
uh were like apps were able to access it

1127
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,560
and with this setting

1128
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,520
the denial has been made and then

1129
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,440
there's a whole uh you know revamp

1130
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,720
uh dynamic permission model which has

1131
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,040
come into play which

1132
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,040
uh will definitely change the scenario a

1133
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,800
lot along with the deprecation system

1134
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,480
windows and you know background app

1135
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,000
restrictions changes

1136
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,839
side loading policies and changes to

1137
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,359
reflection access so

1138
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,920
most of the things that we talked about

1139
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,680
and the landscape is evolving

1140
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,079
and a lot of things will be happening uh

1141
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,640
so

1142
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,400
just excited to see how it goes and at

1143
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,759
the same time we'll keep on working on

1144
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,560
the things and share it with the

1145
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,240
community

1146
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,400
so i think that marks the closure of the

1147
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,359
presentation uh we would be very glad

1148
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,359
for any questions

1149
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,880
great thank you um so we're open for

1150
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,480
questions

1151
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,400
um so think start thinking about

1152
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,760
uh questions you might have we we do

1153
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,480
have one question

1154
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,839
uh on the matter most it's from uh renee

1155
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,680
renee would you like to

1156
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,680
ask it or would i oh i can read it

1157
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,240
i can also ask myself if that's that'd

1158
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,280
be great

1159
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,118
for that yeah so um

1160
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,319
thanks a lot for that talk and

1161
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,319
particularly

1162
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,599
to aditi for introducing or bringing up

1163
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,319
that topic of

1164
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,800
um the potential of sharing data not

1165
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,839
about

1166
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,839
just yourself but about others that

1167
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,480
you may have data on explicitly or um

1168
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,319
maybe even unintentionally for example

1169
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,359
in photos or whatever

1170
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,480
now this transitive

1171
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,839
concept as i tend to think about it

1172
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,880
i i have no idea how to deal with uh

1173
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:20,720
deal with that how did you analyze any

1174
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,839
particular ways of how you could

1175
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,839
raise awareness raise awareness both for

1176
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,560
the users who actually do the sharing

1177
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,240
that they might

1178
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,520
unintentionally share something about

1179
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,078
others and maybe also raise awareness

1180
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,079
of those users whose data has been

1181
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,480
shared by others

1182
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,680
do you have any idea of what user

1183
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,720
interfaces could do

1184
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,040
to make this maybe more explicit or to

1185
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,240
just point it out to users that hey this

1186
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,279
is something that you

1187
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,279
may need to consider when doing that or

1188
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,280
do you want to transitively ask the

1189
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,240
other people that you are sharing data

1190
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,760
about if they're

1191
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,279
if they consent if they're okay with

1192
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,200
that

1193
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,440
yeah so yeah that is like an amazing

1194
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,520
question thank you uh for asking that uh

1195
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,440
i don't have like concrete solutions but

1196
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,480
i do have certain thoughts on that

1197
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,040
uh we we all know that awareness is for

1198
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,000
sure

1199
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,279
lacking as in uh because it's like when

1200
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,119
we deal in natural world

1201
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,720
we know how to act when it comes to

1202
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,160
privacy but when it comes to digital

1203
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,919
world a lot of people

1204
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,040
see it as a device they don't see it as

1205
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,520
a potentially privacy leaking

1206
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,480
gadget right so that understanding has

1207
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,880
to shift i think

1208
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,800
it is happening uh but more awareness is

1209
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,560
needed for sure the way you present

1210
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,119
information to the user is one thing

1211
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,640
which

1212
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,960
tech industry is already working on and

1213
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,279
i think it can be significantly improved

1214
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,720
uh one basic thought was like suppose

1215
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,319
when there is an accessibility service

1216
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,399
active on my device right

1217
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,839
i go to settings and i can see that

1218
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,520
these apps are watching

1219
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,920
like these are enabled accessibility

1220
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,680
services so if an app has accessibility

1221
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,400
servers it can see anything that happens

1222
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,160
on my screen

1223
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,240
in fact get all the text and do some

1224
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,799
actions as well depending on what rights

1225
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,000
are there so that information is

1226
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,920
available in the settings when i

1227
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,079
installed the app i had a look at it

1228
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,119
and after that i just use my mobile as

1229
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,079
is so i'm talking about

1230
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,800
normal user and now when i'm going to

1231
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,960
suppose

1232
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,720
some browser and doing my searches

1233
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,240
there's nothing on the screen that will

1234
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,680
make me aware that okay in the

1235
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,439
background you know what that app is

1236
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,240
also listening to what you're seeing

1237
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,480
right so that awareness is not there and

1238
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,160
it's also not very visually present

1239
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,960
uh on the uh device itself so that those

1240
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,680
kind of

1241
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,880
ux uh kind of changes i think we can do

1242
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,598
so that we know that there is a

1243
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,880
conscious

1244
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,800
uh leaking of information uh again

1245
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,160
uh other than that i think it's more of

1246
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,240
a thing

1247
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,560
i won't say we have technical solutions

1248
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,598
to it because once data goes out where

1249
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,799
it will go

1250
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,000
what will that person who has the data

1251
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
do with that we don't

1252
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,440
know so we don't map how data flows

1253
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,280
across geos and

1254
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,960
across communities or so yeah it's

1255
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,359
definitely challenging but

1256
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,880
making the user understand through ux a

1257
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,359
refined ux would be a good

1258
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,040
first step so you know rather than that

1259
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,160
terms and conditions like we see in

1260
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,920
web and we click i agree that instead of

1261
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,319
that can you make it more uh

1262
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,400
visual or so why do we have to put it in

1263
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,160
this right if you make it more visual uh

1264
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,160
to make the person understand so those

1265
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,319
kind of things it'll to me it will lie

1266
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,078
more on the ux end as of now but yeah

1267
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,640
i'll refine my thoughts on that

1268
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,800
thank you for asking that thank you uh

1269
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,359
so to augment uh

1270
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,000
and answer like uh apart from the

1271
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,640
server-side tracking that aditya has

1272
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,680
shared her thoughts on uh we we are also

1273
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,400
looking at how

1274
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,520
um some of the improvements can be done

1275
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,400
at the client side

1276
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,400
uh for example when when the same crowd

1277
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,440
sourcing is being applied we have

1278
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,040
common platforms beat the system level

1279
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,400
um intents that can get fired on the

1280
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,079
recipient of the person whose data

1281
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,400
the third part is data which is getting

1282
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,839
leaked between the user and the vendor

1283
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,520
and we are conducting few researches

1284
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,680
in the in that area and some of the

1285
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,440
experiments uh probably when we release

1286
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,839
the data we will be able to

1287
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,800
release the efficacy of those models as

1288
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,359
well

1289
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,359
so yeah

1290
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,839
great do we have any other questions

1291
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,799
we're about out of time but um

1292
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,839
you know i thought i kind of add

1293
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,599
something on to that

1294
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,359
are you guys familiar with the idea of

1295
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,200
contextual integrity

1296
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,960
and thinking about uh so if you're not

1297
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,720
familiar this is uh something that helen

1298
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,480
nissenbaum at cornell has been talking

1299
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,720
about for a number of years

1300
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,160
and it's this notion that you that users

1301
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,160
should should allow the use of their

1302
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,598
data under certain contexts

1303
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,839
now one of the things that computer

1304
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,560
scientists have a lot of trouble with

1305
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,599
particularly security people is saying

1306
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,560
how do we allow functionality to happen

1307
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,440
without having strong controls over that

1308
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,359
and so i would be curious

1309
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,839
what your thoughts on how those sorts of

1310
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,960
models might be incorporated into an

1311
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,640
ecosystem

1312
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,920
like this and how that maybe relates to

1313
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,920
the topics we were just discussing

1314
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:18,800
um if i interpret the query correctly

1315
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:22,079
are we talking about how do we enable

1316
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:25,280
contact server computing

1317
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,839
without having to give up a lot many

1318
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,680
data

1319
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,960
is is that correct interpretation of

1320
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,720
your body no so

1321
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,480
this this notion of contextual integrity

1322
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,959
is a if you haven't if you're not

1323
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,560
familiar with it it's

1324
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,160
not really defined context from the

1325
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,160
perspective that computer scientists

1326
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,118
often do but it's more about the use of

1327
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,560
the data

1328
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,119
right so we allow software to use our

1329
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,240
data

1330
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,359
with certain assumptions and when those

1331
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,000
applications um

1332
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,640
sort of uh violate those assumptions

1333
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,960
then the

1334
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,960
contextual integrity is lost right and

1335
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,839
it's it's sort of about how do we

1336
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,200
how do we inform the users how this

1337
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,520
information is going to be used and then

1338
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,759
what

1339
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,359
what ways might we be able to to

1340
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,880
validate that so thinking about

1341
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,560
some of the times you talk about the end

1342
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,920
right you might be able to have other

1343
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,520
other proofs of assurances that they're

1344
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,119
not going to sort of share this

1345
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,119
information with some other application

1346
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,520
yeah so uh i think some of the

1347
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,119
areas can be covered using the

1348
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,200
server-side collision analysis and

1349
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,400
client-side collision analysis like

1350
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,799
generative adversarial uh method uh i

1351
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,520
think

1352
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,119
um iit would you like to uh also pitch

1353
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,319
in with your opinion

1354
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,480
yeah so it's yeah it's a very

1355
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,920
interesting thing so data is actually

1356
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,359
uh you know it is what it's worth for

1357
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
based on where it's used so which

1358
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,319
context

1359
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,520
it's used for as you just said uh and i

1360
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,079
think one thing which

1361
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,920
definitely goes wrong is that user has

1362
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,440
no knowledge of you know the algorithms

1363
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,000
running behind the scene which will be

1364
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,599
using

1365
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,040
the data that the person has given and

1366
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,400
how it will affect it

1367
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,359
so if anyone is asking a basic

1368
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,480
sms permission i give it but then that

1369
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,960
app is reading my

1370
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,800
account transactions and deciding uh

1371
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,480
whether i'm eligible for loan or not

1372
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,079
that thing i didn't know of right so

1373
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
that information needs to be i think

1374
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,000
communicated to the

1375
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,759
uh person who is sharing the data i

1376
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,720
don't have a concrete answer on how we

1377
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,280
can do that

1378
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,078
again it comes back to awareness but uh

1379
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,720
or making it

1380
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,400
very clear in you know the when the

1381
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,640
person installs the app

1382
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,240
but i'm not sure how the developers

1383
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,839
would be doing that eventually

1384
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,439
but yeah that's a challenge i think that

1385
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,960
is something that we have to address

1386
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,160
sooner or later

1387
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,680
definitely a hard challenge so um

1388
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,598
i think that's we're about out of time

1389
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,558
for today um we can't hear everybody

1390
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,520
clapping but

1391
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:48,000
uh if you can have a virtual clap uh

1392
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:57,280
thank you adida and dinesh

1393
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:57,280
and that concludes our first talk
