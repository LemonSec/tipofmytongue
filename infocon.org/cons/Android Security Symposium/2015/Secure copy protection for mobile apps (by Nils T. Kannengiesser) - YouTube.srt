1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,780
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:23,169
Android maybe first shot and I have to
say sorry maybe a short introduction

3
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,390
about myself as I wasn't ready I am from
the Technical University of Munich

4
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,980
employed as a research teaching
associate mainly due to working on my

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,449
PhD thesis topic I have been a guest
speaker at various universities

6
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,280
international you're ready

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,620
originally my major wars information
technology and my current research area

8
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,468
as Android security a little bit about
my super Wireless as well so professor

9
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,030
Baumgarten also from the Technical
University of Munich ass my main supply

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,860
wise and Tom likes our staff and
additional one additional mantra so I

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,600
asked professor song from the University
of Missouri Kansas City USA

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,830
to be my mentor in this case in addition
I would like to thank all the students

13
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,509
who contributed to this project so our
days it's really a long list and this

14
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,579
little still not completed so singing
about the status of my dissertation it's

15
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,529
maybe eighty percent of his last 20
percent are running now the last year

16
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,420
and so the list is not completed yet a
little bit about the content I saw her

17
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:45,060
will introduce it as a topic first
before actually proposing my ideas

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,049
before coming to the actual findings
right now and actually what we are doing

19
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:54,509
or what I am doing right now ongoing
research coming

20
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:01,329
summarizing a temporary is out from the
current state status and also I would

21
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,990
like to cover related work because
there's really lots of it I started to

22
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,549
look for a dissertation topic actually a
few years ago back in 2012 has a

23
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,770
pleasure true true that myself so you
can pick any topic you want and what

24
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,520
this might be fortunate

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,580
sometimes really difficult and so I
looked around what can I do and for some

26
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,950
reason I came together with a company
working with secure elements and they

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,250
had some interesting projects for
Android and so I had in mind when I

28
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:43,280
focused on Android security in 2013
while looking at the reengineering

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,960
possibilities for Android some other
researchers have already launched 2010

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,190
checking the License Verification
library for issuers and well in this

31
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,359
case it's it's really wearing easy so
you basically essentially just have to

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,490
change my line Decompiler change one
line so for instance changes which

33
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,770
statement there or change the value of
their assets willing just one line

34
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,380
change to to get a valid license here
thinking a little bit about houses

35
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:23,490
actually worked everything everyone is
family owned houses last four games

36
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,959
should actually works so for instance we
have just one sample a prince and here

37
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,570
we have actually is a good player which
is connected by the spiders are

38
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,720
basically some sort of message service
and each developers and degrading

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,060
example coach which is actually already
issue of course every developers

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,290
integrating the same example code well
they are supposed to change it but we

41
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,250
found out it's not many people care
about it and don't change it so we have

42
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,910
been harder times as the same example
court here where a few modifications

43
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:12,109
which makes it really easy for our take
on the science messages and so on

44
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:18,570
science but we're only locally checked
so wonderful thing about root rot or

45
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,690
cover this later in detail we can assume
he has an issue already well why should

46
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,450
we actually care about service

47
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,550
copyright protection and authentication
techniques and so on

48
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,240
develop us of course they say she is
that they lose revenue was money here

49
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,280
but what might be even worse as other us
some money with these applications may

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,539
be saying just repackage it they change
some ideas maybe and distributed again

51
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,020
to the market or other markets russian
markets whatsoever

52
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:03,380
our Canadian markets and another thing
as some sort of foreign rights forum so

53
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:11,330
so illegal markets might have infected
applications and also uses techniques

54
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,680
that we just cover it might be used for
technology so France and sinking boat in

55
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,980
a feeling it's pretty much the same and
you can get them bandits and the same or

56
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:30,770
very similar way and assets we found out
may be applied at you so we took a look

57
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,440
at this

58
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,280
lvl in more detail and we found our
church well I had the idea is there a

59
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,390
possibility for a man in the middle
attack and we came out with society oh

60
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:51,060
well exposed frameworks a solid area to
basically allow develop ass or use us to

61
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,220
modify applications dynamically on the
fly and we thought well that's might be

62
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,370
great so we will just endorse up some
function and Exchange a parameter us and

63
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:10,840
of course he is so we had basically to
shake your head to fate of public and

64
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,409
private keys as well and inserted in the
appropriate muscles so that's on the

65
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,540
client-side applications Inc hey we have
to well its license whether Google's

66
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,220
service of course notice you know well
about the customer or is it just doesn't

67
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,950
care about it

68
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,219
application works in this case you know
we notified Google about this

69
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:40,290
issue unfortunately say classified as no
security since only applies to rooted

70
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:47,110
devices okay and we look at the rooted
devices we can only assume there are

71
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:56,730
lots of a rude exploits are there till
now and especially 2014 if we look at

72
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,800
the devices resources from and watch

73
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,000
militaries are which devices are secure
are not secure I guess it's fairly to

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,290
assume that are well no security devices
or very few singing March 2015 we heard

75
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:25,290
about this already staged fraud as
another dude exploits one class to allow

76
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,740
us access to a became hires and
sproutaphiles and so on and so on

77
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:41,310
basically just one already I guess it's
fair to assume that we can access data

78
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,210
from the private fires by application
since ons apk how so my research

79
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:53,130
question my initial research question
basically was how can we achieve that an

80
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,880
Afghan only be executed on a relative
eyes and Bella divisive courses

81
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,500
generally wrote so that's a according to
a license in addition there are some

82
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,870
questions of course is there any
solution for securing data communication

83
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,240
as well yes there are lots of solutions
here so on the one hand we have these

84
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,190
software modifications were mentioned
already so I S II Android president as a

85
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,540
foreign students off work on it as well
with Trust Royal Arms trusts on the hot

86
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,729
side even improved were by
samsungsamsung trust reineck monarchs

87
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,439
one from them and we have seized

88
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,050
like in the devices from different for
instance or solicit basically secure

89
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,010
elements may be used

90
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,270
introduction about these items we think
about trust it's basically a trusted

91
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,939
execution environment system so we have
on the side basically our usual apps and

92
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,770
on the other hand we have some trusted
environment we are all applications are

93
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:08,689
running late should be safe so think
about a banking ever maybe you want to

94
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,250
enter a PIN trenches whatsoever you can
do this on the system and has a very

95
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,850
secure way because it has to do get
access to the hardware to the touch

96
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:26,270
screen so whatever Trojan is running
here cannot access on the other hand we

97
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,870
have secure elements you have some sort
of

98
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,930
in case you may use affairs officer
provide officer companies so for

99
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,270
instance whispered organizing endeavor
and and so on

100
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,819
providing some frameworks hear what he
can do or what we actually do we

101
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,990
communicate

102
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:54,210
last year was a senior lenders St cut
directly and there are actually two ways

103
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,870
to access attention you can assume
running some sort of apps in a secure

104
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:05,940
world similar to this one and for
instance you may calculate some

105
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,780
encryption key is here on whatsoever

106
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,069
sign some data and sent it back to the
application for further processing

107
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:24,420
well I mentioned actually I'm mentioning
now we show was a middle way so secure

108
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,790
elements and actually do it for
corporations the past so I had also

109
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,980
definitely aren't on IM show us their
product available to many devices so

110
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,740
here you will need special hardware
costs only software so there's probably

111
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,860
a rude exploits at some point again

112
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,090
and ask something in the middle

113
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,190
you might say well think about the Nexus
fire and so on how can you actually use

114
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:00,080
my Christie cuts issue and I thought
well let's just use my career as the

115
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,210
micro USB adapter so one new requirement
is basically two houses use beyond logo

116
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:13,580
on the other hand some Android workers
have issues were buffered excess so we

117
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,880
were required to find a workaround for
us or direct issue basically to send a

118
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,800
comment to this ecard because it's a
second interface between science and her

119
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,520
face so these carts use special files
are you can you can communicate securely

120
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:37,640
mount and yeah basically sending a
comment card and receive a reply from

121
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,900
texas has a neighbors and of course it
doesn't work so there's actually a

122
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:52,300
straightforward and well after some time
we figured out another issue just

123
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,449
mounting as the code is already a
problem cause we were you will need to

124
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,880
address you as well and our old boss to
a white rude rights at all costs of

125
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,380
possible so we develop actually is a
slippery for it which is accessing 0

126
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:17,400
device through this micro USB adapter
the raw file system by just asking

127
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,250
Android or so user-friendly USB
permission so do you want to allow us

128
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:28,400
the application to access device and we
actually wants a routing issue because

129
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,240
we can just excessive and of course
since we interpret a filesystem

130
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,830
ourselves we can just a wider social as
well and can communicate with which

131
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,020
brings me to the actual proposal after
we saw all those issues we thought about

132
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,870
ok and we have some struggle and the
desktop Morris and can we actually not

133
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,160
apply on the Android side as well

134
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,269
so you're saying about ideas on finding
apps and secure elements together and

135
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:07,040
came up with this solution idea where we
have maybe some sort of licensure where

136
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,599
we have our secure element a must see
and where we have our own right side or

137
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,600
smartphone application with its a times
on each application basically has caught

138
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,009
at Embassy proxy because this is a
sleigh full amount to be part of a wave

139
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:28,899
and want something same away from the
effort when something is also idea could

140
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,300
be friends and restore here some license
data which may be updated from the

141
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,180
server side and twitch kind of response
for instance single bar down flying to

142
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,979
the yes once and awhile cause I want to
use my application and need a temporary

143
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:51,160
lives in subsidized so we can get a
racist license from the underside and

144
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:58,009
finally changed after the flight later
on what was an update on sellouts offers

145
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:02,199
ideas so singing about device and use
identification of interests probably

146
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,430
essential for copyright protection so we
investigated sir possibilities on

147
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:14,060
Android how to basically identify users
how to identify devices just one example

148
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,119
so for instance using the dark frames
I'm not sure if your family or so you

149
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:33,439
have a camera and trees so different
camera murderous basically when there's

150
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:38,360
no light so you notice already has a
difference here due to the SANZAR as

151
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,100
indifference

152
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,300
whatever reasons manufacturing reasons
maybe so we can distinguish between

153
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,639
different devices he already by
attributes course there are many more so

154
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,810
Bluetooth hardware what package for
signs that maybe a wireless networks

155
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,930
that are around and so on

156
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,069
additional ideas or some awesome
actually proposed by others already and

157
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:13,529
of course we shot well we can actually
improve improvement with Secure Element

158
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:19,839
friends and singing about the content
protection you can encrypt and delivers

159
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:27,500
a key so secure element can deliver a
chelate on all we can do the same

160
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,380
applies to string so we can decrypt and
hide all these messages in our

161
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,060
application and are you out protection
and so on

162
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,439
on the other hand we can also obfuscates
execution using reflections of course it

163
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,980
makes everything small so and so on but
that's a pretty good way to avoid static

164
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:57,889
analysis so thinking about reengineering
really unfortunate thing as a secure

165
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:03,589
elements are where we were slow so we
are 10 killer apps CBO here so you can

166
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,699
imagine doing such calculations of
recession huge amounts of data not

167
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:17,378
willing

168
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:23,559
singing about science and as response
time so we have for instance from an

169
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:30,429
application to secure element processing
about 250 by its power request and just

170
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:37,608
takes about two hundred milliseconds so
sums up to these amounts of data for

171
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:41,329
waiting for one kilobytes 2.4 seconds
something like said if you're now

172
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:46,399
imagine we have some applications
running which are exchanging data which

173
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,959
are requesting data from the server runs
on we have we have to spend lots of time

174
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,108
here already four different task which
of course effects our way home we can

175
00:16:57,109 --> 00:17:03,529
use this kind of protection so to sum up
our radial elements Security benefit for

176
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:11,470
sure so every additional layer of
security was a lesser lots of

177
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,879
improvement ideas so far in Stearns
native worsen of Sylvia since simply

178
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:20,819
more seizure cannot be easily

179
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,388
trusted execution environment support
all our ideas and a trusted execution

180
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:31,729
environment as a secure world maybe
reinvent Google Play and we'll discuss

181
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:37,360
more so in more detail shortly so for a
singer's made of course we assume it's

182
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,158
more secure of course it's simply not
that easy to a dream of course Google

183
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:50,710
dislikes us they recommend sure ya Java
sort of season starts in increasing

184
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,519
complexity nevertheless we saying it's
more secure especially for a license for

185
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:03,990
security related topics to use native
court here if we look at 852 X we saw

186
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,529
the little but maybe it's now seek
Europe maybe say you was made of court

187
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:15,590
here and now and maybe they improved a
lot here unfortunately that's not really

188
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:22,269
the case or if we look at the way how
applications umpires on your words we

189
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:27,520
still have here's a silence on which is
executed later on but before you look

190
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:35,180
old files which has generated we still
have said x5 was able to code and

191
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:43,660
they're so it's really easy to return
still gets a cordon some idea was

192
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,970
actually ongoing research right now

193
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,500
reinvent Google Play so instead of
delivering

194
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,970
apk files and so on why not deliver to
the device native code only so and maybe

195
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:02,710
at some sort of security as well so for
instance collecting some user data from

196
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,560
user details

197
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,760
actually use it during the compilation
shows us that this whole APIs only run

198
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:18,510
up on a device which has the same uses
the same attributes device attributes as

199
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:24,650
a thing as a native over so a lot of
people are using your example codes and

200
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,260
she can fly modify it and record and so
on

201
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,750
you have all these call it's calling
names actually which everybody knows and

202
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,510
so on why not put everything in a native
library which communicates with civil

203
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,400
service directly so you get rid of a lot
of information because all these

204
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,340
informations but are still available

205
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:55,500
actually issue well including right now
we have to assume solutions and our

206
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:04,080
friend cents or even Amazon this even
easier to crack down on me it's not

207
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:12,270
sufficient for copyright protection
right now as I mentioned already every

208
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,790
just a few station every additional
layer helps against reengineering

209
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,450
already of course the question does
affect our performance officer

210
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,290
application may be well that's not my
focus right now so I'm working on the

211
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,379
security side and I have to assume
secure elements provide additional

212
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,990
security here nevertheless I have some
issues right now I cannot process that

213
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,850
much data

214
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:45,469
limited to a few kilobytes here which
actually brings me to a future work so

215
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,550
it would be really interesting to have
performance secure element which is able

216
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,810
to process lots of data decrypt files on
the fly

217
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:04,090
maybe or even additional ideas that
might be sort of singing about a stream

218
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,110
of application may be so and just click
on a stream and so on and interact with

219
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,969
it so that everything is more secure

220
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:20,810
on the other hand might be and so I
don't have the information that I would

221
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,679
like to have about trust execution
environments you get so that's why I'm

222
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,980
actually also here to to see the talk to
text I have some hope that trust

223
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,250
execution environments provide so much
more performance and secure elements

224
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:43,140
here since they are using to my
knowledge the same hardware as the host

225
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:49,630
system even they are running on a
different system and of course there's

226
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,690
lots of related work so you can google
recognized well there's one gap left so

227
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,370
they introduced project was at Google
i/o secure element for everybody more or

228
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,540
less

229
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,340
not much information available right now

230
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:11,760
nevertheless copyright protection using
smart cots kind of secure an amount of

231
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,669
water that was

232
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,879
research years ago already friends
inspire thomas are oblivious from

233
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:23,519
Microsoft to statements are quite
interesting and still true so friends

234
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,249
since copyright protections or rest some
extent security by obscurity and also

235
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:37,190
causing some assets all these ideas RSX
tense the time for pirates copies

236
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:43,039
actually only so there will be a
pirate's such copy at some point but our

237
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:49,440
goal is to prevent and have more time as
much as a possibility that happens very

238
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,070
interesting approach also was presented
by Wei Zhu I hope name correctly or

239
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:59,189
completely virtual machine base
protection so you don't have to anymore

240
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,879
and so on and off course they reinvented
everything and so basically if you are

241
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:09,119
using some sort of reengineering apk
toward whatsoever you get immediately

242
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,720
and say completely exchanged everything
and eight of course on so I really

243
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,769
interesting approach unfortunately to a
203 compilation of Arts I have to assume

244
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:27,649
that it's not working with and what
russians anymore and another slide for

245
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:34,928
more than two tomorrow went on copyright
protection of interest to me of course

246
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:40,019
or simply I want to hide by copyright
protection message so as I have lots of

247
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:45,109
interesting techniques for instance
recognizing emulation to us how can we

248
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:49,918
recognize that we are running in an
emulator descends on way into your site

249
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,350
probably different and Troy that I'm
just saying what's on tonight said

250
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,678
there's a lot of ideas and newspapers
which I can use to hide of course and

251
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:05,220
change my actions when when the
application order of protection has a

252
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,340
feeling and that it gets analized by
someone and of course all these papers

253
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,629
about trusted execution environments of
interest to me as well as well I guess

254
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,439
that's so thanks very much

255
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,570
any questions

256
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:44,509
very interesting talk

257
00:24:44,509 --> 00:25:11,419
assuming the devices you did you can
probably assume that they can change

258
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:15,859
your the framework or whatever to
intercept this year's big communication

259
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:22,109
probably change the outcome he soon
returned one day return 0 things like

260
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:29,939
how do you solve this system yes that's
a big issue since you always have to

261
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:36,449
show you which was insecure world for
quality as well and we have to interact

262
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:41,339
with some of course it's almost
impossible to to somehow secret we can

263
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:46,499
only make it more difficult can add more
layers stewart's decrease a performance

264
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:53,059
by the way that's a big issue so I i
have some hope

265
00:25:53,059 --> 00:26:08,450
distinct told a trusted execution and so
will solve systems of future

266
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,920
its continued
