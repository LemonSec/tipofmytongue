1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,320
addiction

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:24,490
we had the same story switching slights
year we had the same with the contact

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,340
information as we are like talkative we
want to get into contact with you

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,779
personally so we forgot to put their
contact information the first slow ready

5
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:39,750
actually we're like I hope it's
understandable actually were like three

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,890
ppl daniel is not able to be here today
because he's currently presenting it to

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,250
become in Asia my name is not feeling
among us

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,770
my colleague is going to do the second
talk as we're going two percent a

9
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,140
combined effort of our level or at least
a part of all day here today

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,559
yes what are we going to talk about
today

11
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,670
yes we're going to talk about a very
similar topics to one that we are just

12
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,039
seeing we're going to focus on user
friendly mobile security and we're going

13
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:19,970
to do it and an android framework where
you try to combine different

14
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:28,200
authentication mechanisms into one maybe
like i rly invisible and not observable

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:37,040
approach and the special thing about it
is we're going to focus on continuous

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,070
authentication at some point we're going
to focus on being cross device so

17
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:48,658
involved in multiple devices and we're
going to focus on risk awareness we're

18
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,390
going to talk about all of these in
detail later okay this short

19
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,469
introduction I think I don't need to
really introduced why security is

20
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,048
important mobile devices restore many
important details today and it is

21
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,709
troublesome produced those devices or
anybody else gets access to 84 unlucky

22
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:17,280
and the impact of security is something
that we just heard if security and

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,790
usability didn't work together and the
usability of two security that we need

24
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,609
is two too low

25
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,310
people are just not gonna use it so it
no security is of no use of course even

26
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,370
if the secret to be high and people
deactivate it so that all the time

27
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,870
basically with ppl txt winning bidder
locking mechanism for mobile devices we

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,210
see people just for convenience store
eating lots of possibly private data in

29
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,730
the cloud which if you have Tennessee in
your threat model is possibly the best

30
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,760
Urdu you may also select Disable

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
encryption mechanism simply because
people don't want to memorize different

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,320
passwords or the possibility of
memorizing very long passwords and

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,420
typing them very often so there is a
very huge need for easy to use mobile

34
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:15,549
device security in basically all
directions so what we are going to

35
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,920
contribute here as a research that
that's one of the lab studies organizing

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,100
to do when we are contributing
everything to display focusing on the

37
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,140
combination of usability and security as
far as we are able to afford it meant

38
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,390
poor terms and we're dealing with
authentication that's a topic we're

39
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,649
talking about now but we also dealing
about hardware security we are also

40
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,910
including books and see secure laments
we're also analyzing Melbourne at some

41
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,600
point sushi interested in any of these
topics in specific just a protests and

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,310
have a nice jet also like one of the
important topics that are organized

43
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,170
already mentioned to beginning the
digital 'tis something that's coming up

44
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,790
in the future that's all stuff to be
recovering in our lab yes especially

45
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,900
chart-topping authentication we are
pretty heavily focusing on biometrics

46
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:18,470
which everybody has it we have lots of
time and we can use them very

47
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,780
intelligent if we're lucky and sometimes
we focus on an unconventional approaches

48
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,380
that school because it possibly enables
new stuff and especially what we're

49
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,060
currently doing

50
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,950
that's not a stuffed it's important for
today is our new framework that we are

51
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,539
basically in the design phase now we
have its research in progress we already

52
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,880
have stuff but not if it is to come and
get started we want to talk about today

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,810
and we will be glad for input we call it
comment basically it's a framework

54
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,200
combines to risk awareness across T
weiss multi-device and the biometric

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,770
approaches into one framework goal is to
have different plugins every researcher

56
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,530
can easily that's the point

57
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,700
easily develop new approaches were you
have your own metrics are also like you

58
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,950
conventional security like peanut
password and included into the framework

59
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,320
so we want to reduce the effort under
one set of developing new things and

60
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,150
trying it out and you'll get any hits on
mobile devices and the second thing is

61
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,799
we want to combine all these security at
some point becomes rather transparent

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,380
for the user so that there is no real
deficit on on on on maybe having like a

63
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,300
fingerprint or having your pest but the
goal is also to have the framework

64
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,030
possibly just trigger you in case you
want to do banking and there is some

65
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,489
higher security required down the street
soon says you are authenticated already

66
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,110
but the confidence that it's really you
is a bit too low for banking so please

67
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,580
just provide something else and maybe
you can choose maybe you don't have the

68
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,289
possibility to choose it all depends on
the situation

69
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,539
understanding all these plugins
currently it's designed like if you have

70
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,219
a PIN or password

71
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,889
usually you get true or false decision
but with biometrics we can say it's

72
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,520
confidence that its you maybe sixty
percent 30% and combining these

73
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,128
different biometrics we can accumulate
that confidence

74
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:34,959
and it also makes it harder to detect
because mister break three such leaders

75
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,580
in the future instead of one only ok so
the caustic retreat after we had at the

76
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:46,789
beginning I think it's also pretty
well-known depending on the situation

77
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:52,050
you need different protests like if you
have two factor authentication to small

78
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,349
security not only having one fixture but
me being at very very very high security

79
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:01,998
things you need something more than two
factor authentication even and it all

80
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:08,669
depends on the situation soon it depends
basically on the situation which

81
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,359
includes the risk of somebody else

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,899
posing as you or somebody else trying to
get into the system and this is

83
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:22,569
basically were its things started an
interesting it depends on probability of

84
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,599
somebody trying to attack you

85
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:29,539
which could for example be expressed at
the time if you're at home and your

86
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:34,339
device is assumed to be next to you it's
improving then possibly in a texas emits

87
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:41,459
less probably if you're on the bus and
moving and possibly somebody just stole

88
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:46,419
your device combines location already
Mike sample the same issue with

89
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:52,119
strangers nearby mentioned you have face
authentication and Cameron detect other

90
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:55,539
people in the background then it's
possible not very safe to enter your

91
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:01,769
banking pin so that somebody could do
shoulder surfing and see your comp go

92
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:06,669
over the screen and just get your four
digit thinking the same as possible for

93
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,150
example with sweat off indication

94
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,120
if we hear other people talking we could
arise did you possibly in an environment

95
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,930
with different people standing right
next to you where for example speaking a

96
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:25,650
secret password or speaking your voice
at all for a voice recognition without

97
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,750
having a special freeze would be the
safest approach and of course the impact

98
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:40,549
in case you are you have your banking
application opened its maybe the impact

99
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,169
this big bigger if somebody steals to
the west with the open to bank

100
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:50,030
application down somebody just use the
device with which is currently doctor so

101
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:56,040
the impact also influences how we can
handle all these mechanisms that in in

102
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,660
one framework of course also possible to
have different devices if we think of

103
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,579
the cross he was approached maybe you
want advice more valuable than another

104
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,990
one because it s more excess to
sensitive data especially interesting

105
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,720
for people in important decisions if you
may be still devoted to the beginning it

106
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
might not be a problem but if you still
are currently still the mobile device

107
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,090
which is not locked the person could be
in huge trouble ok so hard we think we

108
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:36,510
should approach that we think about
having that confidence and that risk it

109
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,980
continues whether you over time and in
case like your think of Quito

110
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,680
vindication so you are authenticated
while walking you have to do is in the

111
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,040
pocket and you book in your gate is
recognized overtime if you work the

112
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,800
device is getting more and more
confident that it's really you know but

113
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,069
you may be able to just pull it off your
pocket and use it without entering any

114
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,200
PIN or password and if you put it out of
your pocket and put it on the desk that

115
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,350
authentication source is declining so
maybe at that point that story now it

116
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,830
that's maybe not exactly what I wanted
to show

117
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:23,830
but it's the same for the confidence it
just ghosts on the symbol to risk if we

118
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,600
like to detect multiple people and at
some point there are not multiple people

119
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,910
around you anymore that risk is just
going to decline and depending on these

120
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,900
measures we could you write for which
authentication is probably suitable for

121
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,920
the situation and we could also address
if it's sufficient the current level of

122
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,870
security and confidence or if you have
to input something else can I want to

123
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,880
like turned over to my colleague who is
going to explain in more detail

124
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:09,880
something about risk and of course
multi-device approach

125
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:56,329
working on this project

126
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:20,819
home so less as you must now you for
example you're sitting in the office

127
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:28,019
logged into your PC and suddenly you
realize that you should try to text

128
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,920
message to your friends for example then
you take on your mobile phone and start

129
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,679
typing you have to attend the case you
already know militant equation on mobile

130
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:42,238
device then you have to return ticket
actually so if we look this one in too

131
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:46,610
deep and basically already indicated on
Wednesday ways and knowledge but also to

132
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,689
continue on a device which is close by
so we don't know how many times we have

133
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:58,279
to do an indication again and again on
multiple devices and the thing is like

134
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,569
these multiple devices basically have
different contractors like smart watches

135
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:11,029
it's quite difficult to intervene again
and again on the basic idea is like

136
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:16,910
devices which are close proximity
measure user authentication results as

137
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,339
well as the list that we have already
mentioned in the previous lives each

138
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,059
other's this would significantly reduce
the number of extent is explicit

139
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,009
identification processes that are
necessary to perform the operations and

140
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:39,139
other daily tasks basically there are
some assumptions basically that user can

141
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:47,009
only be at one place at a time if he
successfully authenticated device

142
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:54,239
basically the user and device water
quality control over the devices within

143
00:13:54,239 --> 00:14:00,850
arms reach and it also imposes some of
the challenges

144
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,430
that we will discuss bit later actually
so here is basically a big picture of

145
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:13,269
our family basically we have device one
device to we can have multiple devices

146
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,740
installed to conduct those devices we
have indication plugins we have this

147
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:25,579
plugins we have make decision making
models so still we have if we want to

148
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,388
share their trust are indications ted
between multiple devices then we have to

149
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,970
have some kind of action

150
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,389
argues that allows us basically route
shared the trust and confidence between

151
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,240
the devices so if we have only single
device then we don't need that extra

152
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,240
model but we have multiple devices then
we are going to need this exchange

153
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,250
models we are at the stage currently
scratching our heads all weekend

154
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,980
basically the very that we can see light
device within an arm's reach

155
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,880
belongs to the same learning to the same
person and chairperson between those

156
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:14,689
personal devices only this
implementation is from the developers

157
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:20,180
point of view basically we have an open
source implementation which is currently

158
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,489
work in progress and it's kind of pretty
extensible in terms of users can bring

159
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:32,220
in more against and developments of
course and risk tolerance and they can

160
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,269
extend the framework this kind of
pullback are you consider this land

161
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:45,370
security and researchers can use this
one for

162
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:51,630
research purposes and also support the
user studies basically we are also

163
00:15:51,630 --> 00:16:02,670
inviting likely such as we use and
communicate until november is what a

164
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,890
developer research it has to do
basically to insert the plug into a

165
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,460
framework basically we have like I will
post information like just another

166
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,670
indication pluggin and then we have the
service which is basically the framework

167
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,719
service we give the permissions from
other application to read the

168
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,630
identification results and the next
level we consider this is basically what

169
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,279
we are extending the framework service
another application and we can publish

170
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,510
the results

171
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,290
confidence or risk whatever kind of
results we won't publish we can publish

172
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,969
it where this matter basically so this
is the only one that research animal has

173
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:58,290
to do to bring his application like
within the framework school so we have

174
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:04,020
like integration framework which sports
at the moment let multimodal approach

175
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,689
also we are extending it was across
devices and making it more risk of years

176
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:17,079
so that we apply security as far as the
requirement of the rest

177
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:23,040
basically and currently we have plugged
system

178
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,020
we have confidence calculation in future
we are going to words like ross device

179
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,490
at indications tuyen securing bomb
attacks with the template protection

180
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,960
because keeping those templates on
mobile devices does not make them secure

181
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:43,830
if someone get access to those template
it would be like 20 people to those are

182
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,020
in active development research is
already in progress

183
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,850
researchers oil industry partners are
welcome to join

184
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,480
basically and they can develop plug-ins

185
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:20,570
that's pretty much we have any questions

186
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:28,428
I have to question you say do you rely
on physical proximity but actually it is

187
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:35,710
open problem actually to identify with
the devices and proximity indeed or

188
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,710
maybe the signal is just too late so how
you deal with this problem and second

189
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,820
question did you do some measurements to
estimate the impact on battery life of

190
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:58,490
the device battery life still this work
is continuously in progress involving

191
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,299
yourself physically we don't have led
some version running on the mobile

192
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:14,370
devices we cannot say about the so it's
up there for the proof of concept and

193
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:25,110
the first question is difficult to save
devices within the close proximity

194
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:31,059
basically uses first has to allow the
trusted devices and then we have not

195
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:36,690
figured out how we can say like these
devices are unreachable very close to me

196
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:43,009
basically we want to basically find out
some very basically we can find the

197
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:49,830
distance between me and my devices
actually so these are still open

198
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,449
challenges

199
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:02,970
maybe like an extended for one sentence
I think as for some talks before ready

200
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,290
the goal is not to grab impenetrable
security and at that point because it's

201
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,940
just very very very difficult I think
it's may be easier to think of it as

202
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,180
combining many information sources to
make it harder for attackers to really

203
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,070
get through so if you like you measured
proximity to more information sources we

204
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:31,110
we measure and include too hard it's
going to be to really figure then so

205
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,219
even if it's possible to relate and
therefore this gonna be a bit tired but

206
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,270
at the moment we don't have like an
approach to completely disable attackers

207
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:48,240
from relief that's right I have a
question about the use case I'm coming

208
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,910
from the HCI aside and of course it's
not as if you have all your devices

209
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,340
every device has a corner of West
authenticate and so on but some devices

210
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,340
are not merely for one person for
example tabloids their lot of families

211
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,879
who are like to watch Netflix with the
family

212
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,860
iPad or next what do you do then do you
adjust

213
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,389
risk model to say ok this device doesn't
need a high risk threat model or did you

214
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,429
modify the user side that you say okay
these three people can can authenticate

215
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:31,330
with her voice how would you do that the
profiles basically to maintain a low

216
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,970
profile of every year that is using the
current device basically so we have to

217
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:54,410
switch between the profiles

218
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:03,960
just curious what were the results for
the gait analysis get indication we have

219
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,400
I should explain later results in two
different format basically is the same

220
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,360
day performance and across the
performance seemed to promise I mean

221
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,629
like when you train your model and then
you tested on the same day or within one

222
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:25,890
week later and the cost is basically
when you tested out after less than one

223
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,840
month or something like that so in the
same day we have performance around

224
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,770
three to four percent error rate
basically speaking in terms of equality

225
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:41,750
and includes day we had like 13 to 14
percent for a performance of the

226
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:49,380
christian identity is basically you can
see that the fall semester it becomes

227
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:57,760
more snow machines that is actually the
point that is both first met and fall

228
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,610
semester because if you're still trying
to figure out what the real reason for

229
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:10,870
the cross the river is it might be shoes
it might be different clothing so this

230
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,929
has not been controlled for it in the
current study people who did the cross

231
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,340
deterioration within 20 days in between

232
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:37,580
control issues

233
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:44,429
and we're not even talking about
handbags when the phone is not closed

234
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:51,800
today if if I might be extended for one
set the sentence again I think it's also

235
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,440
important if you have like a classifier
or a fearful of diplomatic source that

236
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:03,970
is just a bit better in random decision
framework and much very much

237
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,920
biometric sources you can possibly
combined in like in boosting are begging

238
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,190
approach to get something that is much
stronger than the individual components

239
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,810
so very very long run we possibly
include many of these sources and get

240
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:32,110
the pretty accurate result but it would
also be legal questions

241
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,169
then

242
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,100
thank you again
