00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,500
if i can get my slide set up here shall

00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,460
let Renee help here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:23,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">she is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really fantastic intro because</font>

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's sometimes hard to take a</font>

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,940
step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're</font>

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,620
doing this and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who just</font>

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,660
recently traveled and had to swipe my

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,370
passport and all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it's not</font>

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">just about jailbreaking phones and doing</font>

00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,489
exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> research and finding</font>

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,750
vulnerabilities and building a business

15
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,089
it's really about some of the things

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,670
that that Renee touched on and what

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,620
we're here to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about today so it's</font>

great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here to kick this off and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,699
would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know my approach</font>

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,040
personally and then maybe more broadly

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,190
my company which used to be called via

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,250
forensics we've changed our name to now

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,800
secure probably took a little bit less

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,140
standard approach to maybe what many

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,229
folks here have focused on we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in the forensic space and as I put</font>

27
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,720
this slide back together a bit about a

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,330
good part of this is a basically a

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,580
history of our company and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:26,750
we evolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a forensics capacity</font>

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,310
into into mobile security and so you

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">know my role as I started the company</font>

33
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,670
back in 2008 I'm the CEO and co-founder

34
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,580
and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> background is in computer science</font>

35
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,259
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course in the forensics and</font>

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,560
security space I've written a couple

37
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:45,530
books and just completely consumed by

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,979
this topic it's a pretty amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

39
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,079
exciting space to work in I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

40
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,060
spend just<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four slides just</font>

41
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of setting up the problem as we see</font>

42
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,530
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Renee kind of touched on I</font>

43
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,149
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're industry focused so we work</font>

44
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,310
with large enterprises<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help them</font>

45
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,799
secure mobile and so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,180
academic research is fascinating we're

47
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,310
pretty empirical we're pretty kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

48
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,229
practically focused how do you how do

49
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,200
you go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there today and walk into a</font>

50
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,269
large bank that may have 400,000 devices

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,649
of their own and have them operate in a

52
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:19,130
way that they feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're at least</font>

53
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,720
managing mobile risk not solving it not

54
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,950
eliminating it but trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take some</font>

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,109
steps<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of address some of that</font>

56
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,910
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's can been</font>

57
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,520
fascinating for me and I think for our

58
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,740
company is is that as a mole

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,740
security industry not the academia site

60
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,770
we've spent billions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solving</font>

61
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong problem we've been focused on</font>

62
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,840
as an industry malware and antivirus and

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,900
the reason we've done that I think is

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,180
because in traditional PCs that's what

65
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,800
we saw we saw viruses we saw malware we

66
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,200
had an entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's spun up</font>

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,720
around that and we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> most importantly</font>

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,940
the press and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the general public that</font>

69
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,500
understood the problem so when mobile

70
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,150
devices came out and i've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

71
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,770
mobile phones obviously well before the

72
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,440
smartphones but when when iOS and

73
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,540
Android really hit the industry said how

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,070
do i how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get my my spot on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

75
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,109
phone how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i stake out my territory</font>

76
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,410
well there was already a common language

77
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,940
and it was antivirus it was malware of

78
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,970
course all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us in this room know that</font>

79
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,590
things like sandboxing and the appstore

80
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,350
and playstore and things like that have

81
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,580
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally eliminated the biggest</font>

82
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,320
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that risk sure there's some</font>

83
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,970
malware out there there's some some bad

84
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,890
things that happen but in the big

85
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,040
picture it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not about malware</font>

86
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,230
the big picture is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about leaky</font>

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,239
and insecure apps and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has kind</font>

88
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,760
of been a guiding principle for us we've

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,340
largely chosen to ignore the malware

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,049
problem i mean not completely but if we

91
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,209
find signatures of no malware great

92
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,740
let's put them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there but but we think</font>

93
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the much bigger problem are leaky and</font>

94
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:54,130
insecure apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll show you a video in a</font>

95
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,750
little while we have a an analysis rig

96
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,400
dynamic rig for lack of a better word

97
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,400
that automatically test mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps</font>

98
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,500
without any human interaction and we've

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,020
looked at about 600,000 apps right now

100
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we run them through constantly and</font>

101
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,250
today we're focused on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font>

102
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,920
a rig up and running that automatically

103
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,370
test iOS apps in the early stages<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,349
when we look for high security flaws or

105
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,720
privacy flaws we're approaching about

106
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,160
fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the apps exhibit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

107
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,260
exhibits some sort of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

108
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,450
privacy fall and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty</font>

109
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,400
staggering number malware would

110
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,320
essentially be zero point one eight

111
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,049
percent or whatever google's number is

112
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,700
and Apple's even smaller but leaky<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

113
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,750
insecure apps is a huge number and we

114
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,630
have to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of time educating</font>

115
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,350
industry about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem a thing</font>

116
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,969
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also been very</font>

117
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,730
intriguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us is to look at ad</font>

118
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,530
networks and of course I think the

119
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,350
internet and mobile apps are largely

120
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,659
being driven by advertising and what can

121
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">we learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the end user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when</font>

122
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,160
we did this analysis of the mobile apps

123
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:00,040
fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the apps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are sending</font>

124
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,540
data out to ad networks and sometimes

125
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:07,750
we'll see up to 15 16 ad network SDKs in

126
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,580
a single application so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

127
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">very clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us is that obviously if</font>

128
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,359
it's free then you're probably the

129
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,490
product and they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

130
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want and what you what</font>

131
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,610
you like so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can advertise to</font>

132
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">you so this is really kind of the</font>

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">backdrop of what we think is driving</font>

134
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,170
mobile security we have an absolutely

135
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,150
amazing research team at now secure

136
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,060
pause here today he'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be giving a talk</font>

137
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,799
of tomorrow and we've got this fantastic

138
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,240
group that's constantly looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

139
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
flaws and then figuring out how do we

140
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,620
automate the detection of these things

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and move into a more secure ecosystem so</font>

hat London a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago I'm not</font>

145
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,599
going to do the live demo but I thought

146
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was important not to just say hey</font>

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,500
mobile apps are you know taking our data

148
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and putting out to ad networks and they</font>

149
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,820
have security<font color="#E5E5E5"> flaws but let's talk about</font>

150
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,610
one specifically and we can do demos

151
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,650
later people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see this so add</font>

152
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,620
liver is a popular ad network that's out

153
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,419
there and there's basically a remote

154
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,290
attack that we can can launch against

155
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that at Liberty goes out it downloads a</font>

156
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,980
zip file that actually has a Dex file

157
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,320
sitting inside of it this is how they

158
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,970
serve up their different ads of course

159
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,099
none of that was done with TLS so

160
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,460
anybody sitting between you and upstream

161
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,200
could kind of intercept that request and

162
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,440
then put a specially modified<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dex file</font>

163
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,780
out there and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically we can get</font>

164
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,430
remote code execution the interesting

165
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,559
thing about this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that we can do</font>

166
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,790
that I mean androids a pretty versatile

167
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,800
platform there's a lot of kind of

168
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,240
problems out there but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,950
about scale ad lib<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Korean company</font>

170
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,210
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around a few years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

171
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,510
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into their history</font>

172
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,919
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about eight billion ads they</font>

173
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,300
serve up on a monthly basis because

174
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,600
again mobile apps are powered by

175
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,020
advertising so eight billion instances

176
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,520
on a monthly basis where anybody that's

177
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,890
upstream and has a position<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

178
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,049
network could potentially intercept a

179
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,719
request and get remote code execution on

180
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,640
that device that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ads being</font>

181
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,490
served up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a lot of opportunity</font>

182
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">for somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say you know that had</font>

183
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,790
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP level access that maybe had some</font>

184
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,280
sort of nation-state access to be able

185
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sit in there and these guys are not</font>

186
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,809
that big of a company but by deploying

187
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,060
this advertising technology you can

188
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">easily get into billions and billions of</font>

189
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,210
impressions a month ad lib is pretty

190
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,130
widely used obviously our kind of target

191
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,919
app just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at this was a</font>

192
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,740
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called simsimi anybody here</font>

193
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,350
play this app anybody know about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

194
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,090
I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically as I</font>

195
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,250
understand it this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

196
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,310
that you run and it basically curses at

197
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:54,720
you and uses inappropriate language and

198
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,760
you interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it so about 10 million</font>

199
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,000
250 million<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have found this to be</font>

200
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,010
an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> application and basically</font>

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,050
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a remote</font>

202
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,909
code execution within that specific app

203
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,830
but of course once you've got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

204
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,190
could decide how do you get further

205
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,109
access to the system what was

206
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is is as we set up mid and</font>

207
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,610
proxy and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the different</font>

208
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,690
traffic within the first two minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

209
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,430
to three minutes of running the

210
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,310
application setting it up selecting your

211
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,650
language and getting your first egg or

212
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,720
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that they send you this</font>

213
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,630
was the data that leaked out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and of</font>

214
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,220
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of it was done over HTTP in</font>

215
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,990
the application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just take a minute</font>

216
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,910
to typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I'm talking to</font>

217
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,840
enterprises and<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will get</font>

218
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,969
this i don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

219
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,710
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ad nauseam but there's a lot of</font>

220
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:44,100
sensitive information in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that gets</font>

221
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,880
leaked out obviously imei and mac serial

222
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,820
numbers the country device precise

223
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,460
geolocation they're typically targeting

224
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,610
ads you know based on where you're

225
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,230
located some of your cell information

226
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,900
some unique identifiers that are used

227
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,430
across multiple apps interestingly they

228
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,230
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> root check I don't know how</font>

229
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,880
effective it is but they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

230
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,160
see whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not your device is rooted</font>

231
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,160
and then some information about the

232
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,469
actual device and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application that</font>

233
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,930
it's built into so all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being</font>

234
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,270
leaked out over HTTP and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

235
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">three countries and I can tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you as</font>

236
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,300
somebody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know spends a lot of</font>

237
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,600
time working with large enterprises

238
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,870
especially in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US they care very very</font>

239
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,340
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where their data is going and</font>

240
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,050
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always helpful to be able to</font>

241
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,370
look at a particular application and

242
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,199
data and try to understand what wears it

243
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,700
being sent so in this particular case a

244
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of the traffic went to the US</font>

245
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,540
understandably some traffic went to

246
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,880
Korea because that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company</font>

247
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,130
is located and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's a particular</font>

248
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,260
sensitivity around intellectual property

249
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,310
and whatnot in US companies and so I

250
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">think people are always kind of saying</font>

251
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,719
well what sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data makes its way to</font>

252
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,570
China and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was interesting is is the</font>

253
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,040
in China it's this particular IP address

254
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,270
these are the ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

255
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,709
there and doing the checks to see

256
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,060
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your device was rooted or</font>

257
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,670
not and then sending that information

258
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,339
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> China I'm sure there's very</font>

259
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,319
legit reasons why or maybe you know I

260
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's malicious people</font>

261
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,760
sitting behind every single request but

262
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,680
it is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> intriguing or very important</font>

263
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,960
I think to large enterprises to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

264
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,310
sense for where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my data going what</font>

265
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,190
data is being sent and how are people

266
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,229
getting their hands on it so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

267
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,480
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip the exploit here and not</font>

268
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,530
not do it you know live if folks want to

269
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,810
see it I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you guys</font>

270
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,490
afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but it's pretty simple</font>

271
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,589
you just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can run midam</font>

272
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,630
proxy proxy your traffic through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

273
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,610
device and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for a</font>

274
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,100
particular file that gets requested<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

275
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,110
think it's called classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dex type and</font>

276
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,330
as soon as you see that we just simply

277
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,770
swap out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> add that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add liver would</font>

278
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,840
have served up we put on their own

279
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,090
payload and from there we can download

280
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">busy box and get remote code execution</font>

281
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,810
through a reverse shell<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that was</font>

282
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of background um you</font>

283
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,319
know we you know we as an organization

284
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,880
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see malware as the problem we see</font>

285
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,410
leaking and secure apps is the problem

286
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,750
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of take a</font>

287
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,060
step back and walk you through well how

288
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,760
did we get where we're at today starting

289
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in forensics and forensics obviously</font>

290
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,880
is primarily focused on crime court

291
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,500
cases as i'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Humpty</font>

292
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,130
Dumpty back together again in figuring

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">out what happened so back in</font>

294
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,220
and this is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a history a</font>

295
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,469
little bit about myself and a little bit

296
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,990
about the company I think most good

297
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,570
innovation comes out of boredom I had

298
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,220
spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> six years as a CIO at a company in</font>

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US about a billion dollar company</font>

300
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,470
had solved all their problems i was

301
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty bored and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hired</font>

302
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,990
somebody who was a felon unbeknownst to

303
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,430
me so he was in federal prison<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two</font>

304
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,530
years he had stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million dollars</font>

305
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,420
from his previous company and when he

306
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,370
got out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> prison</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he faked his resume</font>

307
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,219
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hired him into our data</font>

308
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,590
warehousing group where he had access to

309
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,150
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our vendors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oliver pricing and</font>

310
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,430
all of our customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> for over a hundred</font>

00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,530
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was online but it was</font>

312
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a hundred year old company and so</font>

313
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,939
we needed to after we figured this out

314
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,260
and fired him we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to go in there</font>

315
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and figure out what did he know what did</font>

316
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,569
he do and I considered myself a pretty

317
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,920
technical CIO I enjoyed tinkering I did

318
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,210
a lot of stuff with our cisco routers

319
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,390
and programming and things of that sort

320
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,290
and I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that except board I was</font>

321
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,060
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do my own forensic</font>

322
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,610
investigation instead of paying some

323
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,430
company to do it and I was absolutely

324
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,020
stunned at what I found which was

325
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,209
essentially a complete record<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

326
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,460
everything that he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever done and</font>

327
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,600
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> for folks in here that if kind of</font>

328
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,700
studied forensics a little bit this

329
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,040
probably is not you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very shocking</font>

330
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:41,120
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was that point back and i would</font>

331
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,130
say 2007 late 2007 early 2008 that my

332
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,500
entire kind of focus shifted and said

333
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,030
wow there's a world going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here behind</font>

334
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,000
the scenes that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of</font>

335
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,800
and what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so the first</font>

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,060
thought was well go get certified go

337
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,729
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what this forensics business</font>

338
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,319
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and especially in the US it</font>

339
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,510
becomes really important to become an

340
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,430
expert witness<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the federal</font>

341
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,770
court system recognizes you as an expert

342
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,540
and you can testify in court I know a

343
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,870
lot of forensics people that have spent

344
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">5 years 8 years 10 years in the business</font>

345
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,310
and never had a case that ever was an

346
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,990
expert by sheer luck which sometimes

347
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,640
feels like the story of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my life the very</font>

348
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,830
first case I landed and ended up in

349
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,410
federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> court I was pretty nervous</font>

350
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:24,140
sitting there and I was testifying about

351
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,870
a case that it involved an airplane that

352
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,050
had slid off of a

353
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,480
runway and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it killed some people and so</font>

354
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,979
within a few months of kind of starting

355
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the company and getting certified I was</font>

356
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,480
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert witness and it really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

357
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,390
you know my kind of for a deeply into

358
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,860
the forensics world and so began to

359
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,170
develop a business around I did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

360
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,210
bit of computer forensics it's really

361
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,520
tedious it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring i would</font>

362
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,990
recommend don't go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world is</font>

363
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,210
all going mobile and we quickly saw that

364
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,250
so we shifted our focus from computer

365
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,680
forensics into mobile forensics and we

366
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,660
built a business around that and it was

367
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,339
around 2010 that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was sitting here and</font>

368
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was doing a case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

369
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,720
departing employee case these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

370
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,270
most common cases that forensics

371
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,250
businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> get so some sales guy leaves</font>

372
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,810
the company the company gets worried

373
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,640
about what information priceless

374
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,290
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> list that he took with him and</font>

375
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,910
so they hand it off to a forensics

376
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,490
person to go do an investigation and

377
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,469
then settle with the persons that you

378
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,140
know they don't steal that information

379
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,940
and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this case involved not just</font>

380
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,620
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer but looking at this person's</font>

381
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,240
phone in what I became amazed with is is

382
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,860
as I was flipping through and looking at

383
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,450
thousands of lines of data trying to

384
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,640
figure out what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on his device and</font>

385
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,950
what did he try to delete I ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

386
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,170
finding his course his full name all

387
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,810
this credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> information his address</font>

388
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,910
his bank statements balances mortgage

389
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,099
payments absolutely everything was

390
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the device of course</font>

391
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">none of it encrypted just sitting there</font>

392
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,699
in plain text I said holy cow what what

393
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,020
is going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> here this seems to be a</font>

394
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem because clearly this guy</font>

395
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,000
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have stored the information on</font>

396
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,560
his phone the banks don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it the</font>

397
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">carriers don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need it in fact the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

398
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,300
people that could actually use this

399
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,890
information would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some cyber criminal</font>

400
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,599
some bad person that gets their hands on

401
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and could use that to steal</font>

402
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">his identity and so this was really that</font>

403
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,900
kind of second turning point for us

404
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,060
we're all of a sudden I realized that

405
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,760
forensics had something very very

406
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,500
important to say very very important

407
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,770
involvement in the security of

408
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:31,150
smartphones so during<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time I had</font>

409
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,560
written<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple white papers and we</font>

410
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,810
actually turn those into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple books</font>

411
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">Katie strumica and I wrote the iOS book</font>

412
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,020
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an android forensics book and</font>

413
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,040
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually starting on second</font>

414
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,420
editions

415
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,860
the longest time the publisher kept

416
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,509
asking me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back and rewrite these</font>

417
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,949
you know update the books and I said no

418
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,800
no no we're not interested in doing that

419
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:49,540
but I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back in work a deal</font>

420
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,399
with the publisher and say listen I'm

421
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,110
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a second edition I'm gonna</font>

422
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,240
release the entire book for free on our

423
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,220
website I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put it out in a PDF</font>

424
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,110
that's freely downloadable and I will

425
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,380
let you distribute it in a printed

426
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,509
format if you want and they said oh okay

427
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,949
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do that so we're excited to</font>

428
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,209
be able to go back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> write second</font>

429
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,769
editions of the books and they'll be

430
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,689
fully distributed and released for free

431
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,639
on our website and then people

432
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,319
presumably will want to buy them and

433
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,449
have them as references we'll see how

434
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">well that works out so in addition to</font>

435
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:20,949
those books as a company we've written

436
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,810
five books involving mobile security in

437
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,949
forensics and we're actually got two

438
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,388
others<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were in the middle of</font>

439
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,250
writing one about mobile incident

440
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,259
response so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a talk later</font>

441
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,480
in this in this conference i'm very

442
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,639
interested in catching about that topic

443
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,899
and then mobile app testing so all of

444
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,250
these books<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be released on our</font>

445
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:38,350
website for free and you'll start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

446
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">information coming out over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

447
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,240
couple of months so in preparation for

448
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,190
this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm actually went back to the</font>

449
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,160
forensics book that i had written and

450
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,500
took a quick look at a chapter<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote</font>

451
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,769
chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote all about application</font>

452
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,470
analysis and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing a book</font>

453
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,630
and you have targets for how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many pages</font>

454
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,910
and how many words they have to be quick

455
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,250
hint when you include the output from

456
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands it's a beautiful thing because</font>

457
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,309
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sudden you have to show the</font>

458
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,129
commands you to show the output and the

459
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,629
book gets longer and and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was going</font>

460
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,949
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at that chapter and</font>

461
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,860
trying to understand you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what did i</font>

462
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,360
say back in 2011 about app analysis and

463
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,579
there were two interesting statements

464
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,859
that I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pulled out the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones</font>

465
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious stuff but you know when a</font>

466
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,839
forensics person<font color="#E5E5E5"> then gets handed a</font>

467
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,730
phone or sometimes a forensics person

468
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,639
gets handled a file system dump or a

469
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,960
route you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a root partition you just</font>

470
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,640
have a bunch of ones and zeroes right

471
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,429
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to make sense of this</font>

472
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,409
and so how do you take that raw data and

473
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:41,049
bring some context and analysis around

474
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:43,540
it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually bring value to it</font>

475
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,950
otherwise it's just noise and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

476
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,540
wrote an interesting statement in the

477
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:51,600
book which basically said but of course

478
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,190
doing app analysis is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-off thing we</font>

479
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,110
could only do a couple apps i think i

480
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,850
selected<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 applications as an example</font>

481
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,860
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said there's no way I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

482
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,840
nearly impossible due to the sheer

483
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,129
number of apps and then for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android in</font>

484
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,290
particular the number of specific

485
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,760
devices to ever do this at scale and I

486
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,879
haven't thought about that statement

487
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,140
until four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> days ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

488
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,240
realized this conference is coming up

489
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,920
and I had to get my slides done and I

490
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,220
jump<font color="#CCCCCC"> back into that chapter and just</font>

491
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,300
took a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> look and so the book this</font>

492
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,000
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it will look like when it's</font>

493
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,700
online chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 actually just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

494
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,640
whole bunch of apps where I singled out

495
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the app talked about the actual package</font>

496
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,410
name the version what phone I ran it on

497
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,870
who was the developer and then I go

498
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,340
through thinking as a forensics person

499
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,199
and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the different</font>

500
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,939
directories the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> the types and I</font>

501
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,520
explain what is each file what is each

502
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,780
type where's the data located so for

503
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,129
forensic analyst has ever out there

504
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,629
saying like hey I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go figure out</font>

505
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know where can I find this person's</font>

506
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,330
different email aliases they could go

507
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this and kind of find that so it</font>

508
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">was very intriguing for me to see this</font>

509
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,990
it this works it worked great i SAT

510
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,149
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote a python script I would</font>

511
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,460
run the apps i would download the the

512
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,050
data directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would parse it out and</font>

513
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,950
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would copy and paste it into the</font>

514
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,930
to the book here um but you can't do

515
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that at scale we can't go anywhere with</font>

516
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:17,940
that if you fast forward to where we're

517
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,170
at today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

518
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,110
brunt of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to share with you</font>

519
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,900
guys it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different world now and</font>

520
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">unbeknownst I I didn't ever think about</font>

521
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,510
what we tried to do years ago but

522
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,340
unbeknownst to me over the last five

523
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,930
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've actually built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

524
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,360
and I think other researchers have done

525
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:37,440
similar things they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do this</font>

526
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,899
type of work but do it at scale so in

527
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,890
order to to take that individual I ran

528
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,600
the app on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my phone I I pulled out some</font>

529
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,190
interesting directories and files I

530
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,350
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what gets created and what</font>

531
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,790
gets deleted and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> might care</font>

532
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,679
about from a forensics<font color="#CCCCCC"> our security</font>

533
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,450
standpoint in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that at scale</font>

534
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,450
there's a couple things you need to do

535
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,970
first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be able to do</font>

536
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,960
both static and dynamic analysis

537
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:06,420
of the the mobile applications and when

538
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,040
we do dynamic analysis in particular for

539
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android but the same applies true for</font>

540
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,180
for iOS we actually obviously have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

541
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,860
instrument these phones so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font>

542
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">runtime we can collect as much</font>

543
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,110
information as we want so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> android we</font>

544
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,390
instrument the dalvik<font color="#E5E5E5"> VM but we also</font>

545
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,860
instrument things at a kernel level<font color="#E5E5E5"> pow</font>

546
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I were having breakfast this morning</font>

547
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,570
and we were talking about GPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> locations</font>

548
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,670
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to be able to control what</font>

549
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,260
information we pass to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> app so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

550
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of track that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if it</font>

551
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,020
ever pops up somewhere else and you can

552
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,550
go in there and add a dalvik layer and

553
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,020
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard API layer you could</font>

554
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,659
go in there and say hey any<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

555
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,480
somebody calls these api's for<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS feed</font>

556
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,190
them this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information but developers</font>

557
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,190
especially on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android find interesting</font>

558
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,080
ways to do things they can skip the

559
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,090
standard API is they can do more direct

560
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,949
calls and so what we ended up finding is

561
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,139
is that even though we could patch the

562
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,760
dalvik VM<font color="#CCCCCC"> and instrument that what we</font>

563
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,100
really needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do was also do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that at</font>

564
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,020
a kernel level and when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through</font>

565
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,600
the work that required to do that in an

566
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,810
intelligent way the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got</font>

567
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">was well beyond what we expected so we</font>

568
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,080
get an enormous amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data back and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the core core properties that matter for</font>

571
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,860
both security and forensics one of the

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,080
other key things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is we store</font>

573
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,729
everything so any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of artifact that</font>

wireshark and recreate things in the

function that was called so that we can

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,580
see what functions were called what were

584
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,410
the parameters that were passed into

585
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,419
those functions so that we could go back

586
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,090
for example and try to understand how is

587
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,800
data encrypted you know for forensics

588
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,480
people things like whatsapp is really

589
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,730
important because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of</font>

590
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,560
information that takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> place in these</font>

591
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,330
instant messaging and these messaging

592
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,159
applications and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be able</font>

593
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,520
to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and each new</font>

594
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,750
version did whatsapp or did whatever

595
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,090
some of the other popular ones out there

596
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,700
we chat did they change how they encrypt

597
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,270
the data that's at rest what are the

598
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,590
keys and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

599
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,990
if you're going to be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at kind of</font>

600
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,149
dead data data just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there to go</font>

601
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,970
back and decrypt that do you have the

602
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,110
things that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so so we</font>

603
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,390
capture a lot of information through

604
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,100
both static and dynamic analysis mostly

605
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we do is command line and we're</font>

606
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more these two</font>

607
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,780
websites make it easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to do</font>

608
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,860
it who are less familiar with the

609
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,500
command line we support both manual and

610
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,360
automated so one of the things is is we

611
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,490
were we were fortunate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a couple</font>

612
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,639
DARPA project so<font color="#CCCCCC"> DARPA's the DoD's</font>

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">advanced research group in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and we</font>

614
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,650
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping secure mobile apps and one</font>

615
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we found is is that</font>

616
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,820
for that particular program they were

617
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,230
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of open-source tools and</font>

618
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,389
trying to automate mobile app testing

619
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,600
and we came in and did some manual

620
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,090
analysis and every app failed our basic

621
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,129
tests and one of the big lessons that we

622
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,370
learned is is that that human in the

623
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:12,460
loop is absolutely critical to securing

624
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,679
mobile so automation is the only way to

625
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle this at scale but you can never</font>

626
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,890
take the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

627
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,080
build tools that can do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font>

628
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,450
smart automation but any point in time

629
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,520
have that human pick up where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they start</font>

630
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,110
where that automation left off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

631
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,790
jumping<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the rabbit holes and really</font>

632
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,590
looking for the flaws and the weaknesses

633
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,840
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just simply haven't built into</font>

634
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,149
the automated systems so supporting both

635
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,820
manual and automated and to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

636
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:40,300
created a technology for both iOS and

637
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,250
Android that will automatically run

638
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,190
mobile apps and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you video that</font>

639
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,930
in just a second now one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

640
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ran into is is that we started</font>

641
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,200
out I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like probably most</font>

642
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,450
developers and we started out using like

643
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,370
our DBMS is like my sequel or even

644
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,200
sequel light and we ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding</font>

645
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,639
that the sheer volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data that we</font>

646
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,670
were creating through this automated

647
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,650
process we simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't keep up and</font>

648
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,900
so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did for</font>

649
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,420
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worse is we decided that we</font>

650
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:11,740
needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop a data store that was</font>

651
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:14,380
very scalable and very lightweight as

652
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,970
many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys know if you're you know</font>

653
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,430
building these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the simpler</font>

654
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,290
that they are the better we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can run</font>

655
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,880
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things at scale so so we came up</font>

656
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,399
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple set of api's that would</font>

657
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,750
scale both horizontally and vertically

658
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,850
we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ways that we could</font>

659
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,980
efficiently store data and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

660
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,810
move them over into<font color="#E5E5E5"> warm stores and cold</font>

661
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,340
stores if the information was outdated

662
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,050
we still wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain access to that</font>

663
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,090
but needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to kind of</font>

664
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:40,180
intelligently store that and put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

665
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,280
to cheaper slower storage another key

666
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,170
property for us was we needed to be able

667
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to stream technology so we constantly</font>

668
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,830
have data coming in and I'll explain

669
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,050
where we get some of our data and we're

670
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,490
not always ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to process that data</font>

671
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,620
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes we come up with a new a</font>

672
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,450
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> technique a new idea and we need to</font>

673
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,520
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to replay a data</font>

674
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,130
stream and then reprocess information so

675
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,710
that was another key property for us and

676
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,540
we handle all of our indexes and whatnot

677
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,400
in a data access layer what we found was

678
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,200
trying to build out an indexing

679
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,050
mechanism that was smart you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

680
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,610
actual data store later became something

681
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know you build out a much</font>

682
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:17,800
bigger much more complicated system so

683
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,419
ultimately we settled on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

684
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,730
called leveldb so this is actually

685
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">written by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google it's used in chrome</font>

686
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a number of other places it's a very</font>

687
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple key value pair store and we've</font>

688
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,760
hired some folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> paolo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fraga monty is</font>

689
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:35,140
our vp of engineering and we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

690
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,980
higher core team members out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

691
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:41,440
leveldb group<font color="#CCCCCC"> julian in a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

692
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,030
other folks and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've built out a</font>

693
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,100
very simple data store that scales

694
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,780
nicely and this is a core part of how we

695
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,429
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get this data in an accessible</font>

696
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:52,629
format one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting things and</font>

697
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,010
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be able to read</font>

698
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,730
this you could zoom in and look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

699
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,270
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one of the interesting</font>

700
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">things is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that app analysis for mobile</font>

701
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,520
is constantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing it's never ending</font>

702
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:06,879
right Android M comes out iOS 9 comes

703
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,410
out touch ID no matter what that one

704
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,850
guarantee we have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile is in that</font>

705
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,040
three to six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's going</font>

706
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look a little bit different and so</font>

707
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,100
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that became</font>

708
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,620
really important was the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

709
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,780
back and reprocess to add new engines in

710
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,580
there to recheck things in a way that

711
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of recue up a half a</font>

712
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,720
million apps and say hey you know we

713
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">just found this new flaw with openssl go</font>

714
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,190
test these half a million apps and

715
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,870
relook for this flaw or go through the

716
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,250
properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are out there and see if</font>

717
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,889
we can determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not these</font>

718
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,420
apps might be vulnerable so for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

719
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,559
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really get into app analysis</font>

720
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,330
you know that it's a very calm

721
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,019
flex space and kind of constantly

722
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,100
changing I threw this in kind of at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

723
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,950
last minute something that I'm

724
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,559
particularly interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in I call this</font>

725
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stack overflow syndrome for those of</font>

726
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,710
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there that hack code you guys</font>

727
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,379
ever go out to stack overflow and say

728
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,269
how do i how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do this thing right I</font>

729
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:59,590
wanna do a certificate manager and I

730
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,940
have more important things to do I'm

731
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,139
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's written that and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

732
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,509
for that one that gets a little check

733
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:07,029
pocket this is the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do certificate</font>

734
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:09,700
management or validation great copy

735
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:11,200
paste pop it in my app and go and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

736
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we found is is that</font>

737
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,259
again what we call the stack overflow

738
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:17,769
syndrome is somebody writes a piece of

739
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:22,059
crummy code and it ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in 10,000</font>

740
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:23,980
applications overnight and so what's

741
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,230
been intriguing to us is with anybody

742
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,369
use a technical elasticsearch so you

743
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,990
could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> blanc if you have a lot of</font>

744
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:30,549
money otherwise elasticsearch is this

745
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,799
nice kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of indexing technology based</font>

746
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:36,759
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lucerne it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen</font>

747
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,820
java-based engine but anyway really good

748
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:42,669
at indexing text github uses it behind

749
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,320
the scenes for all of their source code

750
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,499
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever searched for fur coat on on</font>

751
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,769
github so what we do is is you know you

752
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:53,200
grab your<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPAs and your apks you reverse</font>

753
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:55,419
engineer decompile the apps index that

754
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,700
source code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you identify a</font>

755
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:59,110
problem right one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

756
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,909
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a couple years ago is called</font>

757
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,959
the secure random problem there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

758
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:08,590
is an issue with how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android primed the</font>

759
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,059
pseudo-random number generator and so

760
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,439
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are different ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't learn</font>

761
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the specifics about how you use you</font>

762
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,619
random or whatever and here's the right

763
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:16,419
way to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number and here's the</font>

764
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:18,549
wrong way and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out you</font>

765
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:20,289
find an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting kind of code snippet</font>

766
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,240
where you can say this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong way</font>

767
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:25,029
to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now you have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

768
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">go back and search over a half a million</font>

769
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:28,570
a million a couple million apps and just

770
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:31,268
find that particular flaw very quickly

771
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,158
no more analysis needed identify bad

772
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:35,200
code go find it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of an</font>

773
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,850
interesting area for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're</font>

774
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,679
beginning to look for those app flaws

775
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,449
and characteristics and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately</font>

776
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:44,740
kind of regression test that against<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

777
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:46,899
the apps that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen out there but</font>

778
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,360
the core of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we've been focused on</font>

779
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:51,008
call it for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 18 months and its</font>

780
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,659
really kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to fruition now is</font>

781
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,220
the

782
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,200
this basic concept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think will</font>

783
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,370
make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everybody in here which is</font>

784
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,160
all right let's go in and set aside key

785
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:04,379
pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that we care about and</font>

786
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this list is extensible and you can put</font>

787
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,740
anything that you want in here but let's

788
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,890
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and control these values so the</font>

789
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,840
GPS location we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set gps location</font>

790
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,060
we pop into every app we can change that

791
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,360
at any<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so how does this app behave</font>

792
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:20,250
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vienna vs chicago vs you know</font>

793
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">pakistan or something like that but you</font>

794
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,340
go in there and you take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that</font>

795
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,050
you care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control that and</font>

796
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,850
you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you can identify that</font>

797
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,730
within the system then you go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

798
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">you exercise the mobile apps in the</font>

799
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,060
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was writing the book</font>

800
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:36,270
that meant fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the app install it</font>

801
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,889
run it type in information you know

802
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,780
capture your peak apps and your file

803
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,450
systems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and this is</font>

804
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,560
what we've obviously automated so that

805
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,080
we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that by hand anymore</font>

806
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,220
you do static<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis on the</font>

807
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,840
applications and of course you do

808
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,470
dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis while you're exercising</font>

809
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,209
the application and primarily it really

810
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,890
boils down to these two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

811
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,380
we're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is data</font>

812
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:02,070
transmitted and then how is data

813
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,120
persisted and can we identify flaws and

814
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,710
mobile apps and this is where our

815
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,050
forensics thinking comes in a very

816
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,120
empirical way can I go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and say</font>

817
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,470
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I built some static analysis</font>

818
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,510
engine that looked at your code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said</font>

819
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,430
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad because we went out</font>

820
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,530
there and said I just saw your credit

821
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:20,280
card in plain text or I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw your</font>

822
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:22,740
credit card in md5 or some silly<font color="#CCCCCC"> X or or</font>

823
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,290
URL encoded things of that sort so as

824
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,120
we're exercising the mobile apps we're

825
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,600
constantly monitoring and I think we

826
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,239
have a list of 18 15 18 different types

827
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,379
of encoding that we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for but you</font>

828
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,050
know will automatically take those

829
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,640
values in md5 them for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try</font>

830
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,800
to identify if somebody is sending

831
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,500
sensitive information but in a way that

832
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,379
a reverse engineered app with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

833
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,330
kind of attacker on the other side could

834
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,370
say hey I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can go out there and</font>

835
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,929
find information that that would be

836
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful for them so we're constantly</font>

837
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,490
monitoring that and then as we find

838
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,620
these different values we just store

839
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:04,080
them in that key value pair and in a

840
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:05,939
very ultimately searchable format so the

841
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,040
core to this of course to do it at scale

842
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,890
is to have a way that we can inspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

843
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,450
automatically run mobile apps and so we

844
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,280
built something UI Automator I think

845
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:17,100
that's literally what Android or Google

846
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,960
calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of their automation framework</font>

847
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,139
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that creative in the names</font>

848
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,780
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically go through and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

849
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,790
out a view hierarchy of every mobile of

850
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,560
the application so we know you know what

851
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,330
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of GUI elements are presented to</font>

852
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end user and we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

853
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,590
inspect them and see them so things like

854
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,060
most of the time when somebody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

855
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,439
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your name they create a field and it</font>

856
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,300
says user or user name so we're just

857
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,940
kind of building on a very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

858
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,060
that goes out and looks at the the

859
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,670
hierarchy of the GUI and then identifies

860
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,710
those different values and allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

861
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,990
automatically fill in those properties

862
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,360
hit the button<font color="#E5E5E5"> swipe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left swipe right up</font>

863
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:59,340
down whatever it happens to be and

864
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,800
exercise that application<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our first</font>

865
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,389
versions of this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Powell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

866
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,080
very involved in it was really focused

867
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:09,210
on doing that on Android<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the most</font>

868
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,510
recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that we've done is is is</font>

869
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,010
building this out for iOS so I might end

870
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">up needing help here we'll see if I can</font>

871
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:24,330
figure this out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a video and I</font>

872
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:29,700
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just show this to you guys okay</font>

873
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I gotta drag this over and then nice</font>

874
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,030
if I gotta find<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mouth okay so I'm</font>

875
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,440
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> let this run in the background and</font>

876
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,379
I'll just describe this a little bit but

877
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,940
but this is basically Jake van dyke one

878
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,260
of our researchers recorded this for me

879
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,140
last night we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a video that was</font>

880
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:46,890
really old we've got racks of devices

881
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,680
today their Nexus 7's oh yeah yeah and

882
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:51,210
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> was working on the Nexus play stuff</font>

883
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,800
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so that we can because you</font>

884
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't buy these these devices anymore</font>

885
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,149
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the scenes we just started</font>

886
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,090
queuing up a huge list of mobile apps

887
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,880
and we just say hey go push those apks

888
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,159
to the phones automatically run them

889
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,980
inspect that hierarchy and just start

890
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,090
inputting data and collecting it so

891
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,980
we've hooked the colonel we've hooked

892
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,080
the dalvik<font color="#CCCCCC"> VM we've hooked all these</font>

893
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,550
guys up over USB and behind the scenes

894
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,149
you'll see that we

895
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:20,490
can see let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me get the pointer here for</font>

896
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:23,010
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here you can see that</font>

897
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:26,100
we're downloading the data local temp

898
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,650
we're installing it and then we'll end

899
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,870
up grabbing for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> here data that</font>

900
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,790
data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box that unzip we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grabbed</font>

901
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:35,459
every one of the files that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out</font>

902
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,440
there being created<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we tar.gz at</font>

903
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,450
them so we can go back we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

904
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,070
this particular application is you know

905
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,160
storing some data out on the on the

906
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:46,260
media directory we've got different

907
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,460
loadable libraries out there that might

908
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,370
be interesting for us to go in there

909
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,110
inspect so behind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenes constantly</font>

910
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,850
and you can see up here it's that the

911
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,129
things trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out can it click</font>

912
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,169
on this button obviously that one's in

913
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,880
Korean so we've been running into some

914
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:03,150
interesting properties<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like can we</font>

915
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,770
automatically translate these apps if we

916
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,120
can pull out the Unicode and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them</font>

917
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,350
into translation system and bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

918
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,489
back so an analyst could be able to go

919
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,940
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and figure out what happened</font>

920
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:13,649
sometimes devices crash sometimes they

921
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,360
get stuck but in general we're able to

922
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:17,880
go out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and run apps and find lots</font>

923
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,910
of flaws in the applications and find

924
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,080
different properties and then you know

925
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,699
we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> make all of that</font>

926
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,909
information accessible through our

927
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:29,428
storage mechanism so we can index it go

928
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,409
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you kind of what that</font>

929
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,270
ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up looking like so this is a six</font>

930
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,830
minute video I'm not going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

931
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:38,699
watch the whole thing but you kind of

932
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:41,069
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how can we take crawl the</font>

933
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,139
app in Play Store get our hands from

934
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:45,929
contagion you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happens</font>

935
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:48,000
to be can I get a PKS or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipas push them</font>

936
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:51,660
to devices automatically exercise them

937
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,668
and examine both the file system the

938
00:34:51,659 --> 00:35:01,440
static analysis and the network analysis

939
00:34:53,668 --> 00:35:03,600
to find flaws in the apps<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

940
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,760
kind of UI Automator in action how am i

941
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,690
doing on time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just went</font>

942
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,950
through that video now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna just</font>

943
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">take you through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some slides and</font>

944
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,009
apologies these are kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> command-line</font>

945
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typically where we start</font>

946
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,940
out and just give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some ideas of how</font>

947
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do this so here's an example of us</font>

948
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,260
just submitting an application

949
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,320
that David<font color="#E5E5E5"> Weinstein he's our director</font>

950
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,390
of research<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an application that</font>

951
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,340
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of hacked together and then</font>

952
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,720
he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in query it and</font>

953
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,340
basically say hey give me any details

954
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,959
about this application so that's a

955
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">really simple function where we just</font>

956
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">queue this thing up and then go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font>

957
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">get some properties about it so in this</font>

958
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,130
particular case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get the URLs of</font>

959
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,500
the developer names which is really

960
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,540
helpful so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

961
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,270
found is because so many apps are

962
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,310
failing basic security and privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests</font>

963
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,870
that we had to build the disclosures and

964
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">automated disclosure systems just to</font>

965
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:56,580
keep up originally we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just submit</font>

966
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,160
an app a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> example is Microsoft they</font>

967
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,470
were they were fantastic to work with we

968
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,299
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flaw in Outlook it's towards</font>

969
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,129
your username and<font color="#CCCCCC"> password and plain no</font>

970
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,930
no it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> man-in-the-middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against</font>

971
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,290

972
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,850
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for enterprises because you</font>

know your credentials could get man<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and we submitted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ticket</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they were on top of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it they</font>

976
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,920
responded to us they patched it and the

977
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,860
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> went out and then we you know you</font>

978
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,920
know let our customers know as well the

979
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,570
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is when you find 250,000 apps</font>

980
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,730
that have security flaws you just can't

981
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,290
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that email anymore so we ended up</font>

982
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,990
building out a disclosure system that

983
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,520
automates the this information and so we

984
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,529
can come in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and grab for instance</font>

985
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">their developer emails and automatically</font>

986
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,550
send them notifications and then we can

987
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,040
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just kind of for</font>

988
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,750
instance the sha-1 which becomes

989
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,430
important if we've seen a nap before and

990
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,220
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do we end up storing</font>

991
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:52,080
an s3 was signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs and so we can make</font>

992
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,399
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this data than accessible</font>

993
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,990
ultimately to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the research community</font>

994
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,790
which is a key goal and one of the

995
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excited to be here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today and</font>

996
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you what we've been up to so can we</font>

997
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,580
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and say hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

998
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,050
go grab this APK here's a sign URL go do

999
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can you can go take a look at</font>

1000
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,530
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of queueing</font>

1001
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,379
up a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at some of the metadata</font>

1002
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:13,770
downloading it on basic app properties

1003
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,720
so the concept for us was you there's

1004
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,270
there's new you know reverse engineering

1005
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,649
tools decompiler static analysis and

1006
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,640
regard is one that we use a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1007
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">people use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but there's going to be</font>

1008
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,779
another one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future so we built a</font>

1009
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,880
in architecture that meant we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1010
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,070
plug in new engines I don't really care

1011
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">what it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the there's a company called</font>

1012
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Galois you guys familiar with them they</font>

1013
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,089
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> research they've</font>

1014
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,490
done about how two or three

1015
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the apps may work in concert to have</font>

1016
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,569
some sort of security flaw so you could

1017
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,050
go plug in some new engine so for this

1018
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:45,060
example you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew guard</font>

1019
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,700
analysis we just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1020
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,170
and say hey take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that app show</font>

1021
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,149
me the Android guard analysis and in

1022
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,010
this particular information exposed for

1023
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,990
me the different permissions and there's

1024
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,790
a huge list that comes back and you can

1025
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,930
see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the permissions this is this is</font>

1026
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,820
kind of Mickey Mouse stuff everybody

1027
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,250
does this but we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a way</font>

1028
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,500
that's very repeatable and a very

1029
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,900
consistent way to go in and query this

1030
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,700
information where<font color="#E5E5E5"> things start getting a</font>

1031
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,690
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting is is when</font>

1032
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,029
you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing static and dynamic</font>

1033
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,520
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well let me go out</font>

1034
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,350
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to identify any sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1035
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:20,100
network issue and in this particular

1036
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:23,730
case let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we looked at I</font>

1037
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:26,460
think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple hundred apps and let's go</font>

1038
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there and find flaws we're sensitive</font>

1039
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,550
data is being leaked so this goes back

1040
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:34,230
to us populating our own data and in

1041
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,450
this case the imei so this is obviously

1042
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">a made-up imei number we know that's the</font>

1043
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,160
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using come and just</font>

1044
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:44,520
go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me every app that</font>

1045
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,279
exposes this information and so in this

1046
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,790
particular case we found that value is

1047
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,680
URL encoded and then we store the full

1048
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,759
URL and we store the pcap so you can go

1049
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and reanalyze it so in this</font>

1050
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,350
particular case you can also see that

1051
00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's being done over HTTP in addition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1052
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:03,060
you know storing not only just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the imei</font>

1053
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,620
but you've got a lot of other

1054
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,009
information in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that URL right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mac</font>

1055
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:11,819
address android type versions languages

1056
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:14,070
things of that sort so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out</font>

1057
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,150
use this system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> automatically find</font>

1058
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:20,970
imei automatically find the mac address

1059
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:24,180
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is a taxi application in</font>

1060
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,200
in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> brazil so you can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of end</font>

1061
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,470
up going through and seeing a whole

1062
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,060
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> properties that was</font>

1063
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,500
where we were at kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

1064
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,710
ago one of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we do</font>

1065
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,030
is because we hook the colonel we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1066
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">there and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at in this</font>

1067
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,750
particular case it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even require</font>

1068
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,069
Colonel we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> out at logcat and</font>

1069
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,320
we've got something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called stealthy spy</font>

1070
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,400
and as an example because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is could</font>

1071
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,560
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> important for a forensic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> investigator</font>

1072
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,900
I said all right why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you let me</font>

1073
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font>

1074
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:53,680
every application that in a very

1075
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:56,319
simplistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> way seems to have a field</font>

1076
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,210
called password that it's storing in a

1077
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:59,230
sequel light database does that mean

1078
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:02,529
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them will store the</font>

1079
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,730
password no we track password we can

1080
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:05,500
taint that value and track it through

1081
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system but can we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just go out there</font>

1082
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">and find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know what applications</font>

1083
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,439
at least have that column name sitting

1084
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:13,690
out there and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple query</font>

1085
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,599
for us to do and we can go out and begin

1086
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see that now a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys would</font>

1087
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:23,500
probably recognize this is probably a

1088
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:26,829
pretty standard instance where people

1089
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,720
are doing reusing the browser web kit

1090
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:30,760
and basically WebKit automatically

1091
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,169
creates a bunch of sequel aight files so

1092
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,789
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that these particular</font>

1093
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,170
applications are storing your password

1094
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:37,930
but just the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to go</font>

1095
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:41,500
out at any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and define</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1096
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:43,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">information another thing we found was a</font>

1097
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,700
function tracing was very helpful so

1098
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,140
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we come in here and use that same</font>

1099
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:51,220
technique to go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1100
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright who's using AES how are they</font>

1101
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,750
using it so here we could see these guys

1102
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,140
using bouncy castle we can grab the

1103
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:03,400
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL handshake we can see for</font>

1104
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:05,049
instance what files exist what mod we

1105
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,569
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> some recent flaws where people</font>

1106
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:08,799
have a world readable file 777 so we can

1107
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:10,750
go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and identify all of those</font>

1108
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,670
and you know what data is getting

1109
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,380
deleted where maybe a forensic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyst</font>

1110
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,150
would say hey I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that data when</font>

1111
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,039
I look at the app at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it being</font>

1112
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,510
exercised but I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that temporary</font>

1113
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,430
files were created and I could get my

1114
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,109
hands on them<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some forensic</font>

1115
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,180
techniques so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in at a</font>

1116
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:29,140
very low level and see basically every

1117
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,940
file creation every file delete we

1118
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:34,690
extract SSL session so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can go back</font>

1119
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">and decrypt SSL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and where we're at today</font>

1120
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,020
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've taken the kind of those</font>

1121
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,760
primitives and we're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a lot</font>

1122
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,440
easier to now query so here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

1123
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,210
of a recent query where you could just

1124
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,099
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright sensitive data leak and</font>

1125
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,690
return back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me the package name the</font>

1126
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:48,760
application version and description

1127
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,779
because again we've got a big system out

1128
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,270
here now there's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of key</font>

1129
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:55,119
value pairs and I changed all of these

1130
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,410
value names to really lame made up

1131
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,390
package names because we haven't

1132
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,160
disclosed any of these but we literally

1133
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,960
have hundreds of thousands of flaw

1134
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,328
just sitting in this database that we're

1135
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,280
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the automation so you</font>

1136
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:09,880
know we track personal identifiable

1137
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,589
information URL encoded md5 you know

1138
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,220
where's where's data being sent what's

1139
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:17,078
being sent who download zip files in

1140
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,000
plain text we found a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different number</font>

1141
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">of attacks where we could do you know</font>

1142
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,390
swap out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different zip file do a path</font>

1143
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:24,160
traversal attack so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1144
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,750
interested in saying hey show me every

1145
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,089
application out there that ever

1146
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:30,039
downloads a file zip file<font color="#E5E5E5"> over plain</font>

1147
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,720
text so that's very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to</font>

1148
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,730
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go out and</font>

1149
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,520
actually see the actual URLs I changed

1150
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,079
most of these not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and you</font>

1151
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,059
can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that's</font>

1152
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,440
the ad lib<font color="#E5E5E5"> er one so it's really simple</font>

1153
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:43,839
for us now to go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say you</font>

1154
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,059
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what for all of those 600,000 apps</font>

1155
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,710
that we've looked at show me any app

1156
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:49,390
that downloads something called classes

1157
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,160
deck stands if we pretty much

1158
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,720
immediately know that that app is going

1159
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,480
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable to the remote code</font>

1160
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,819
execution and so it's a way to again to

1161
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,089
index and find this information who's

1162
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:03,520
got broken TLS what's the specific

1163
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:06,279
address IP that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I obviously faked and</font>

1164
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,099
forgot a digit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there what's the actual</font>

1165
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:10,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">j/s file so we're able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out here</font>

1166
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:12,760
now and find a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of properties of</font>

1167
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:15,460
security properties of applications and

1168
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,349
again all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this stemmed from forensics</font>

1169
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,520
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of back in the early day of how</font>

1170
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:20,529
could we build a system that

1171
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,920
automatically stored and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracked the</font>

1172
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:26,920
information about applications we took a

1173
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,109
small sample size five thousand apps for

1174
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">it four and a half thousand abs yes we</font>

1175
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">can put pretty gooeys out there so you</font>

1176
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,400
guys are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable going</font>

1177
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,380
command line and key value pair when you

1178
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,390
when you go out and enterprises are your

1179
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,619
customers they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see nice little</font>

1180
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,328
charts and they can click through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1181
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:42,520
whatnot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that we do is in</font>

1182
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:44,859
JSON and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple to to</font>

1183
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,230
turn into some nice dashboards and then

1184
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:48,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the analysis is you know</font>

1185
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,750
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go through is really quick</font>

1186
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,299
because I know I only go about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

1187
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,160
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> left now we can start looking at</font>

1188
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:56,920
600,000 apps and begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at some</font>

1189
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,009
high-level properties on average apps

1190
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,930
require 20 permissions we look at the

1191
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,279
dangerous permissions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys can</font>

1192
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,990
change this list for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you care</font>

1193
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">about but we can look at what percentage</font>

1194
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,680
of applications are having those

1195
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:10,720
different permissions and we took a look

1196
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,470
at any application that has over a

1197
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,730
hundred million downloads

1198
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,069
we have a list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote</font>

1199
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,900
dangerous permission so again you could

1200
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,840
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and what was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting is</font>

1201
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:22,160
is that of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 118 apps that we</font>

1202
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,460
looked at that had over 100 million

1203
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,170
downloads only 13 of them did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not ask</font>

1204
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">for what would be considered a dangerous</font>

1205
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,890
permission this is information that's

1206
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,259
ultimately going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help us understand</font>

1207
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:37,220
the ecosystem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help enterprises manage</font>

mobile risk application download count

00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,270
versus number permissions essentially

1210
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,160
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> read this chart that says the</font>

00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,970
more permission it requests we have

gets the more vulnerabilities we

1216
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,430
actually find and we thought would be

1217
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opposite people like oh great we've</font>

1218
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:59,390
got 500 million people that use our

1219
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,040
application we're going to take extra

1220
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">care to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">security team and QA team we actually</font>

1222
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,640
find this is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the psychology</font>

1223
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,440
behind it is 500,000 people are using

1224
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,140
our app if I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top of my game</font>

1225
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,910
some some upstart company is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1226
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,200
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and take my position as king</font>

1227
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,560
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just start pumping up</font>

1228
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,270
features as fast as I can and they tend

1229
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ignore security and we find more and</font>

1230
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:26,690
more flaws that can get us access to 600

1231
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:28,730
million phones so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

1232
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,349
right i hope it's interesting but where

1233
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,119
it gets far more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> than static</font>

1234
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:34,310
and dynamic analysis is when we begin to

1235
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,670
combine this information with additional

1236
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:39,500
data sources so a while ago we recognize

1237
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:41,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some of the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting stuff</font>

1238
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,060
happens on the phone itself so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1239
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,649
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security application that in</font>

1240
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,049
the process of helping people secure

1241
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,270
their phones we can collect anonymous

1242
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:52,460
information and understand more data

1243
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:54,170
about the ecosystem and combine that

1244
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:56,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the static and dynamic analysis so</font>

1245
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,640
we've got apps that run in iOS and

1246
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,950
Android those apps are used in 188

1247
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,379
countries around the world we've got

1248
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,089
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> editions of our app testing</font>

1249
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:07,070
and forensics products those are used

1250
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:09,560
around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all that data flows</font>

1251
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:11,660
into us so<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me telling you hey</font>

1252
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,089
there's a taxi application in Brazil

1253
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:17,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaks out your imei we can begin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1254
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:20,660
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> average we're finding</font>

1255
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:22,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that per device 50 applications have</font>

1256
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:25,290
access to for example all of the user

1257
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:27,300
account information

1258
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,770
so when we begin to combine static and

1259
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,510
dynamic analysis with additional

1260
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,910
information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how apps are being</font>

1261
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,920
used on devices around the world what

00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,839
Wi-Fi networks they connect to do they

1263
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,580
have pins and pass codes we can start

1264
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,070
surfacing out far<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting</font>

1288
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:30,270
interesting is this clearly Facebook's

1289
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,580
going to patch some flaw in their app

1290
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,930
because it's a massive application how

00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,150
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are running insecure</font>

00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:42,180
versions so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts to help to put</font>

1294
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,100
additional context around around this

1295
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,589
information we have a forensics product

1297
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:50,520
around the world I think you know

1298
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,870
generally they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to root their</font>

1301
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:00,210
one of the interesting properties is

1302
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,370
that we can see by<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel by phone</font>

1303
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,050
where do the root exploits work and

00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,549
where don't they work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is gonna</font>

1312
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,090
more and more information and combining

1313
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,549
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of a big data play here</font>

1314
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:28,680
if you will we're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think secure</font>

mobile in a way that becomes a lot more

1316
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,919
intriguing so there's a bunch of use

1317
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,180
cases we threw out there you know where

1318
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,160
does forensics work on a particular

1319
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,779
device if you have to collect metadata

1320
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,700
at the time let's say you're law

1321
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,500
enforcement you know there's been

1322
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,149
no a homicide or something and you're

1323

sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying well what what</font>

defend against these what apps are

1338

kind of redone it over the past nine

1342
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,650
months from the ground up built an API

1343

layer built out that storage layer that

1344
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,040
i mentioned got an orchestration layer

1345
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,209
that you just plug in your different

engines do your different types of

1347
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,990
testing and we're building each one of

our products on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's what</font>

1350
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,630
excited to kind of talk to this group

1351
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,250
about and let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know is is that we</font>

1360
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,859
part of our team so we hire a lot of

1361
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,750
these amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> researchers give them time</font>

1362
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:04,799
to go work on their open source projects

1363
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,050
and then we incorporate them into our

1364
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,119

combining<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with interesting data so</font>

1372
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:27,839
that ultimately we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big data</font>

play to try to make mobile more secure I

1374
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,400
think the malware days are over yes

1375
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,779
malware is out there it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mobile</font>

1376
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,550
app that does some crappy things so

1377
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,380
let's go identify that and try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1378
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:39,510
off with people's devices but it's a

<font color="#CCCCCC">small subset of a larger problem which</font>

1381
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,630
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start because of the volume</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about a data centric approach</font>

analysis all together in a system that

1388
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,710
can then be searchable and I think that

1389
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,660
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leverage things like</font>

1390

ultimately secure secure the future for

00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,910
come up or until<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rene kicks me off stage</font>

1405
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:40,828
here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there any questions yes sir</font>

1406
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:43,500
I about the UI automation that you

1407
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:45,750
mentioned how do you know how to feed

1408
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:49,109
the fields let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the malware</font>

1409
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:52,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked for the user email address you</font>

1410
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:55,710
need to identify in what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mother is</font>

1411
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:58,770
required in order to place yeah yeah so

1412
00:51:55,710 --> 00:52:00,900
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things that you know</font>

1413
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,000
as a researcher I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at every</font>

1414
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,770
use case and say I've nailed that you

1415
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,470
know some guy came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some way to</font>

1416
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:10,619
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for this you know problem and</font>

1417
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:11,939
ask for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data and we caught it the</font>

1418
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:14,040
reality of it is if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building a</font>

1419
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,900
system that scales and ninety percent of

1420
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">your problems how did you do with just</font>

1421
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,980
basic flaws we built a system that

1422
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,420
addresses the basic flaws and then we

1423
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,760
bring that human into the loop to

1424
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,530
identify that particular use case so so

1425
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,060
you know we found malware that basically

1426
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:31,950
uses like a native library to pop up a

1427
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:34,560
GUI that we can't expose the UI

1428
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:36,060
hierarchy and so our rig just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fails but</font>

1429
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,160
what we end up doing is is every time it

1430
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:40,078
fails we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull a researcher off and</font>

1431
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,970
say that just failed right there can we

1432
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,770
code in a specific rule to deal with

1433
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,200
that property and then can we make that

1434
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:48,180
more extensible so we basically focused

1435
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,890
on the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case and then the one</font>

1436
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,810
offs we go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and we figure out</font>

1437
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,129
what they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we just add that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1438
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,630
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make the agent more</font>

1439
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:57,480
intelligence yeah but how you identify

1440
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:59,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the application is</font>

1441
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,180
fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

1442
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:04,560
when you place let's say an email

1443
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,839
address and you need to press<font color="#E5E5E5"> a button</font>

1444
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't really know what the reaction</font>

1445
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:12,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so I think</font>

1446
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,190
to two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things one it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

1447
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,390
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of early on cases where</font>

1448
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,520
somebody snuck something through will

1449
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:19,740
get through the big analysis you know

1450
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,120
that we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now but the</font>

1451
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,370
second thing is is when you think about

1452
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,230
malware you've got to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody like</font>

1453
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,460
my dad who can<font color="#E5E5E5"> barely use a phone right</font>

1454
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:28,410
and he's got to be able to type

1455
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,970
something in there so that they can get

1456
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:31,620
what they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> then lock down his</font>

1457
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,240
phone or get his information so there

1458
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,130
are things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen on the screen and</font>

1459
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,450
we're exercising the app the way a

1460
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,800
normal user would if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font>

1461
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:41,850
write a piece of malware that affects

1462
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,770
Joe user then re r UI Automator kind of

1463
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,569
acts like Joe user doesn't doesn't know

1464
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,160
all the different stuff so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1465
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,350
point is is that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of use</font>

1466
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,549
cases early on that the sneaky things

1467
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,990
going on when somebody wants to

1468
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,580
circumvent system though it's just going

1469
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,470
to get by and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to catch</font>

1470
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,450
it but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so many flaws that we</font>

1471
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,459
found in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that larger set and then we put</font>

1472
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:01,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kind of individual that human on</font>

1473
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,190
that one off case and we just have to go

1474
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,260
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1475
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">they did and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright here's a</font>

1476
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,200
technique we're seeing that's being used

1477
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,970
more and more let's let's deal with that

1478
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,000
in our code so it's just manual

1479
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:17,640
exception right now and one more

1480
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:22,680
question level you are doing in a static

1481
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:26,220
analysis about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list strings on</font>

1482
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:29,310
the Dex file and manual reversing no

1483
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:33,089
auto reversing of the decks file- level

1484
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:35,730
all the first three yes and native level

1485
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:37,890
we do not do automatically at this point

1486
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:40,710
and so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we built this system</font>

1487
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:43,140
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may go back one or two slides it's</font>

1488
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,850
just that today we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and</font>

1489
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">regarding a couple others and some basic</font>

1490
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,990
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do right on our own but</font>

1491
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,700
you can plug in any new engine that you

1492
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,990
want and just reprocess so when somebody

1493
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes up with an interesting way to</font>

1494
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:57,720
identify something that we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1495
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">of oh great just pop that thing in their</font>

1496
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,919
req up a million<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps and let it run</font>

1497
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,390
just with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> new engine but today</font>

1498
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,170
we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like and regard and</font>

1499
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:10,920
we do strings we reverse the code basic

1500
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:12,730
stuff and our way you combine the

1501
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,730
analysis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1502
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:16,870
dynamic and static analysis together so

1503
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,090
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we wrote a lot of our own</font>

1504
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:20,620
custom code everything becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key</font>

1505
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:22,660
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair that sits under the package</font>

1506
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,910
name for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have one that just</font>

1507
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:27,009
says pcap and then it links<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an s3</font>

1508
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,049
file that's a pcap file but then when we

1509
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:32,260
process that pcap we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out with</font>

1510
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:33,430
things like URL encoded like what are

1511
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,020
the different properties and we just

1512
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:37,120
expose them as kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of individual</font>

1513
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:39,310
properties key value pairs and so we've

1514
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,020
built out this indexing engine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1515
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,270
very extensible and we literally just

1516
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,680
take the values<font color="#E5E5E5"> key value pair them and</font>

1517
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:47,770
then we index them from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1518
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,919
it's it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to run the app</font>

1519
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:52,570
APK over and over again you know no I

1520
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,790
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at least once</font>

1521
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,170
and sometimes will find that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1522
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,570
new engine or maybe we made a mistake

1523
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:01,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to rerun them but one of the</font>

1524
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:03,130
values of bit by storing every every you

1525
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">know every log file every pcap the file</font>

1526
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,520
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up finding a</font>

1527
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,160
flaw somewhere we may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back</font>

1528
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,500
not run<font color="#E5E5E5"> any app through and just go</font>

1529
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,660
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the analysis that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1530
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,590
already saved out in s3 and we could we

1531
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,480
could do an analysis there and never

1532
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:19,780
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rerun it that that's the goal</font>

1533
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,420
let's take the case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

1534
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:25,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested other questions to anybody</font>

1535
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:27,880
else have questions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good go</font>

1536
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,280
ahead sorry let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the case when you</font>

1537
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an APK odinga Dex file from a</font>

1538
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:36,580
remote server and do you do you know how

1539
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:40,780
do you know that in this case you need

1540
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:43,690
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> also analyzed to do static analysis</font>

1541
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,130
to the new text file yeah yeah yeah

1542
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,750
definitely so we were I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

1543
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing things like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know sha-1</font>

1544
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,530
signatures and whatnot and we look at

1545
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,060
version numbers and whatnot but

1546
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's based off of sha-1 so if</font>

1547
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,720
somebody has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same package name and</font>

1548
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,220
even the same version and number but it

1549
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,129
has a different shot one will cue that

1550
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:03,490
up and and we'll run that one thank you

1551
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:06,180
yeah thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you there's a question in the</font>

1552
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,180
back if we're okay

1553
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:27,579
so your work shows that have really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

1554
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:30,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem yeah but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is did you</font>

1555
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:32,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">think how to improve the situation do</font>

1556
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:35,680
you think about approaches how to

1557
00:57:32,529 --> 00:57:37,779
provide kind of feedback to developers

1558
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,029
so that they could improve their systems

1559
00:57:37,779 --> 00:57:42,039
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely so I didn't focus on</font>

1560
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that today that is essentially the point</font>

1561
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:46,779
of our company so what we end up selling

1562
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,808
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprises is a tool that allows</font>

1563
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:51,489
them we call it lab CI lab continuous

1564
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:53,380
integration so every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

1565
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:55,630
developers check in and there's an

1566
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:57,880
automated build a PKR IPA will<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue it</font>

1567
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,619
up to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> system they run it internal</font>

1568
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,969
it goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those problems and</font>

1569
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:03,190
then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1570
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:05,529
hey you you sent this in the clear it

1571
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,789
says in this function<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sent this you</font>

1572
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:08,199
know you use this technique and you

1573
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:10,359
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing over here you failed</font>

1574
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:12,789
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh wasp in the cwe and here's how</font>

1575
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:15,699
you go fix it so we're focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving</font>

1576
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:17,410
those developers kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as real as near</font>

1577
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:19,660
real-time information about you just

1578
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,699
created a flaw you know or we discovered

1579
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,140
some new problem with media server as to

1580
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:25,690
sell whatever it is and here's how you

1581
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:27,940
go fix it as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand the</font>

1582
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,469
enterprise is actually a company who

1583
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,799
would install this<font color="#CCCCCC"> app but they are not</font>

1584
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:34,930
developers at the same time yeah so can

1585
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,719
they patch the application in some way

1586
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:40,299
the candy enterprises patch application

1587
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:42,489
or maybe did you think how would you

1588
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:44,529
provide some means to patch the

1589
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:47,920
vulnerable application yeah so I mean

1590
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really more of a overall platform</font>

1591
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,130
problem for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a let's say Apple and Google</font>

1592
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:53,289
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what we do for</font>

1593
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:55,059
companies is two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things one they have</font>

1594
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:56,829
their own mobile apps sometimes hundreds

1595
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:58,569
of them and we help<font color="#CCCCCC"> them kind of make</font>

1596
00:58:56,829 --> 00:59:00,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that they never have flaws and the</font>

1597
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:02,619
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is we say by the</font>

1598
00:59:00,339 --> 00:59:04,599
way you know your customers your supply

1599
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:07,089
chain your employees they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running all</font>

1600
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:08,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">these apps go hit our Intel feed and go</font>

1601
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:10,269
see what what data is leaking out about

1602
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,609
you so while we can't come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

1603
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:14,468
here's how you patch that taxi

1604
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:16,538
application in Brazil we can at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

1605
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:18,160
say that taxi app is leaking out all

1606
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:20,259
this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your CEO if you</font>

1607
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,699
don't like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's a better taxi</font>

1608
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:23,559
application that's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so</font>

1609
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:25,599
that the the patching that we do for

1610
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:27,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party apps for enterprises is just</font>

1611
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,479
driving visibility to the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1612
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:31,710
then helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> them make better choices</font>

1613
00:59:28,479 --> 00:59:38,730
didn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about some solution</font>

1614
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:41,430
like cloud epithet run the patients and

1615
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:45,839
test if they leak some information so

1616
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:48,868
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go over like another</font>

1617
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,160
step and fix their problems so if I

1618
00:59:48,869 --> 00:59:52,800
understand the question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it cut out a</font>

1619
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,779
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I think what you were</font>

1620
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,310
describing is can we can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it to</font>

1621
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,540
the developers can kind of automatically

1622
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,359
run these tests while they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1623
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:03,150
development that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100% what we've built</font>

1624
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:05,520
so we call it lab continuous integration

1625
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:08,010
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is every time they build it</font>

1626
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,540
we're examining the<font color="#E5E5E5"> apk and IPA so we</font>

1627
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:11,580
don't do it while they're typing their

1628
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,830
code but as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they compile that</font>

1629
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:16,020
will go out there try to find those

1630
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:18,540
problems and saying hey this is broke go

1631
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:24,690
fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> welcome</font>

1632
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:26,490
great well thank you guys I'll be around

1633

1634
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:30,118

with with you guys this is a amazing

1636
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,200
group of researchers and academia here

1637
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,440
so we're really excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thanks for</font>
