1
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,190
am currently living in Greece but

2
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:49,839
so I'm from an easy and is also the
European

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:01:06,800
we're not really recommending it

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,679
we cannot recommend but we're just
mentioning them and saying something is

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,440
that when we come across and the agenda
today was first mentioned a bit about

6
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,720
any reason I'm not trying to advertise
here and just putting things into

7
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,070
context and why we are doing this
presentation today that would see the

8
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:32,270
end users incident handling process and
then we'll see a case study to show this

9
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,479
incident hundred process so any such as
I said earlier to European Union agency

10
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,300
it's the full name as European Union
agency for a network and information

11
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:49,259
security announced we're visiting Greece
have one foot and Athens on one foot in

12
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:58,280
her so some degrees nice place to be in
right now so very comfortable just as

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,759
the main activities of Tunisia does so
what we do is we do we give

14
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,959
recommendations to our member states we
implement policies so via sister

15
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,580
European Commission policy
implementation and most were both

16
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,319
mobilizing communities we don't do a lot
of hands-on work but what we do is we

17
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,549
bring people who do hands-on work
together but later we also started doing

18
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,819
a bit of hands on Elmwood suspected
training and cybersecurity exercises so

19
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,369
and the training that we give
particularly its through the computer

20
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,730
security incident response to some of
you may know them as he searched some of

21
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,579
your certs and the main goal of these
agencies that saves to control and

22
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,540
minimize damage and preserve evidence
provide quick and efficient recovery and

23
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,840
prefer to prevent similar future events
and gain insights into train threats

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,730
against organizations are spread all
around Europe you can see in 2005 there

25
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,899
were just a handful but now the
situation is

26
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,200
different we have one in every more than
one at least one in every country

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,510
certain countries have more than one is
one particular country that has a cert

28
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,970
for certs so that's how big it has
become actively involved in starting up

29
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:22,549
research and giving training to them so
we hope the certain three ways first of

30
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,819
all we produce good practice gates one
of the initial good practice guide that

31
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,670
we set up as how to set up a circuit
then we moved on to how to how to handle

32
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,339
incidents and we do a lot of studies and
based upon these studies we provide good

33
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,819
practices then we started providing
training resources there freely

34
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,149
available online have the eurozone
offered in LA to talk them particularly

35
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,340
which are training creation basic
incident handling and another one is

36
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,970
more better it's so they will be doing
is merging these two training contents

37
00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:00,790
and putting them into one presentation
and then we go hands-on training we go

38
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,418
to the country's we give training the
invite law enforcement the invite people

39
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,940
who do incident handling and will
provide training to them and to have the

40
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,500
training that we give his creation basic
incident and bring more businesses have

41
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:21,810
another training that we provide
incident handling process this is what

42
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,400
we base our incident handling one we
have this way here I go through each

43
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,760
individual stepped on by one we don't
need to have a big look but it goes all

44
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,699
the way from incident handling

45
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,090
dissident resolving and to post analysis
and improvements proposes again you

46
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:44,060
don't need to see it on now will go to
step by step and in our case study

47
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,460
so when we provide this to our and
sometimes we don't tell them you have to

48
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,729
use this this is the way it is just
follow step-by-step and you'll be ok no

49
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,450
I'm depending on who the incident
handler is this they take this as a

50
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,500
template and they just customize it to
their own needs to have to make

51
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,210
considerations how many resources they
have we've met some research that had

52
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,789
for example to people and our team and
others had teams of sixty people so

53
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,370
obviously they would have a different
incident and the process and the number

54
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,240
of incidents that they handle you be
surprised at the number of incidents at

55
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,020
Eve small to big constituents health and
they don't offer much is not

56
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,419
proportionate to the number of people
who are new things and also the

57
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,349
sensitivity of the incidents what we're
dealing especially with law enforcement

58
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,530
and they have to deal with their
students in a special way they have to

59
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,960
contain everything they have to make
sure that they don't expose information

60
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,359
so there are a number of considerations
that you have to add up when it creating

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,370
your incident handling process so we
made the request to one of our season so

62
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,940
we don't understand can you give us your
heart defect analysis incident handling

63
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,530
process and they gave us this I don't
expect you to read it but it's very much

64
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,710
based on the one that we gave them and
what's interesting is that for each step

65
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,020
they gave us the tools so we have the
beginning and they have tools

66
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,109
specifically for this part 43 hours then
we'll have to wait for the actual man

67
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,940
with analysis the list choose what's
funny is that we told him ok what do you

68
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,350
do when it comes to mobile and there are
so well as they struggle said we don't

69
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,020
do anything because they don't have
skills they don't have tools and they

70
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,680
don't have knowledge so that's where we
went in and we have them a bit and we

71
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,350
told him some tools that are freely
available we usually tell them it's up

72
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,910
to them to go and look for commercial
but we usually show them the capability

73
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,449
of the tools

74
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:44,629
so so with each step of the process what
we recommend is to produce a workflow so

75
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,249
to get from one state to another is what
we do is we tell them listen make a

76
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:53,520
workflow or even just a list of a list
of advice on how to get from one state

77
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,830
to another and this will give the whole
flow of the bigger picture and easier

78
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,770
flow how to get from one point to
another what tools to use and you get

79
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:09,628
the big picture of how to handle an
incident and as you keep getting more

80
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,319
and more artifacts you keep getting more
malware getting one instance the more

81
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,379
you received them are you become the
teacher used to it the more you see the

82
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:23,189
best practices using shortcuts what was
you could use and you improve your

83
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:29,819
system are more sore today it's quite a
topic usually we get all this and like

84
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,199
one day and a half training so today I
think everything and I thought the best

85
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,279
way to do this what would be to go
through a case study we had one

86
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,599
particular case remember states and they
didn't have any experience in mobile and

87
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,149
they gave us they just give us and he
became known as the centers of

88
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:48,430
circulating in our constituency its
ransomware it it seems to be quite

89
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,099
dangerous and we need some help so we
went in there and we had that to this

90
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,990
incident handling process and with some
tools that we were some freely available

91
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,919
towards gonna mention any countries and
other mention any teams so far this case

92
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,020
study were going to pretend that we're a
company called me and we just the eighty

93
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:15,568
department with vendors company contact
me so sad incident started the incident

94
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,069
and this case of the incident started
that the manager came up to us to listen

95
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:26,169
my device is locked I cannot use it so
shouting at the AP manager he doesn't

96
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:31,229
care what happened he just needs more
about work again in his and this is what

97
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,159
he was presented on his device so you
can clearly see that as France somewhere

98
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,419
and it's asking her for its it seems to
be targeted as well

99
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:45,310
director and standing here if your
device has been encrypted give us ten

100
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:51,560
thousand dollars in fines and we will
unlock your device and the devices

101
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,880
unusable because it keeps wanting of the
message just like normal so there's no

102
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,769
need to register this event it's always
best I've register ticketing system we

103
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,079
just mentioned mentioned a date the
title of the incidental gives a

104
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,880
Mathematica ticket eighties so we can
refer to it in the future and some basic

105
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,769
information that's when we move on to
triage

106
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,380
French medical term so it's a situation
where you have limited resources and you

107
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,889
have to decide on priorities and and
your actions based on the severity so in

108
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:33,649
this particular case we're dealing with
ransomware we could prioritize the start

109
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,149
as because it served as director and you
cannot use this device on his reentry

110
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,110
and we'll send it to a team member
that's more suitable that scene 1

111
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:49,380
husband skills and more balanced and in
this case have John Smith ok and as soon

112
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,769
as we started within the wedding
technical work here but it's important

113
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:58,610
to start reporting everything so it
could be in the incident handling system

114
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,320
in this case we just used the word
document but it's always better to

115
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,420
automate everything to have a system we
can put in all the information so you

116
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,279
say who's the assignee of this incident
what type of incident is this malware

117
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,540
and somewhere and just an overview of
what the event is and we move on to the

118
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,920
incident resolving which is the actual
longest part is the main part of the

119
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,560
incident handling process for resolving
its not a single step it's it's a cycle

120
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,380
usually go to start with the data
analysis you go to resolution research

121
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,459
sometimes you have to go back to the
data analysis on a step-by-step process

122
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,579
it's a it's a cycle and it's the longest
phase and hopefully it will create a

123
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,449
solution

124
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,040
so in the beginning with the
stakeholders with useful data and

125
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,510
evidence in this case the primary
stakeholders the director himself and we

126
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,490
have to go in contact and see if he has
useful information also may notify them

127
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,090
in this case we don't need to notify
them because they notified us and we

128
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:06,080
also for data and evidence so when
interviewing the director he gave us

129
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,220
this email to customize this but he said
he received a spear phishing email that

130
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,480
was directed to him and he said that was
from the eighty department and they said

131
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,280
listen we have an update on your mobile
device

132
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,069
download the application and we will
install your application and it was

133
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,710
customized it was from their department
and they convince them just by using the

134
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:35,380
spear phishing the conference time to
install the apk game so we get as much

135
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,780
information as we can with a device with
a number of throwing just the method of

136
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,110
infection with information so as we're
going on we're constantly filling up

137
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,370
information on the incident report to
the resolution research usually there

138
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,050
should be a brainstorming session with
everyone involved

139
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,719
ok they decided not to pay to Reston it
might seem obvious to most of the people

140
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,140
here but you'd be surprised we have
reports that certain countries were

141
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,910
actually the police were actually
recommending people to pay the ransom

142
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,270
because it's not worth investigating

143
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,960
so there are some was like trying to you
or something and they were just telling

144
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,960
people if you want your data back then
there were some other services where

145
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,530
there was one particular service where
you could send them your encrypt the

146
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,730
data they were decrypt it and send it
back I don't know who'd be willing to do

147
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,920
that but anyway do with these kind of
services as well so in this case we have

148
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,400
the matter will analyze because we have
the email will manage download apk so we

149
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,130
can understand it we can try to reverse
the operations of a kind

150
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,560
hopefully restart the device and in the
meantime we need to isolate the device

151
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,599
just think he's stealing data going to
make sure that it's not you know

152
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,350
network remove any network that certain
procedures as we usually recommend but

153
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,199
there's a whole other topic area so now
what we're gonna do is basic static

154
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,859
analysis dynamic analysis of what I like
to call hybrids automated tools some

155
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,120
people may have other names for them I
like to call in this cuz I see them that

156
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,870
their automated way of doing static and
dynamic analysis for this particular

157
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,029
case we started to talk to me that the
hybrid analysis we moved on to dynamic

158
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:28,730
analysis then we did static analysis and
then we did our educational recovery so

159
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,790
for automated hybrid analysis using open

160
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,209
not open source but rather online tools
there was one concentrator very similar

161
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,670
ones and revisiting the song from under
business over here

162
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,890
trades right down a different race read
more by Sam book so we particularly use

163
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,199
this one has a preference we use that
because the malware was already uploaded

164
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,130
there so we could just use the report
that was already uploaded we just too

165
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,600
damned if I have made a search online
and found the man was already over there

166
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,140
disclaimer over here you have to be
careful when using these tools are

167
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,500
online and reports that you generated
online so especially if it's a targeted

168
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,650
attack like an hour's case maybe you
don't want to divulge some personal

169
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,010
information that might be on the under
my matter itself especially verse

170
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,000
targeted for example find the e-mail
address of the employees maybe it on to

171
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,940
expose this kind of information

172
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,310
ok so now I was going to love it you
better said I did the number of

173
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,959
screenshots is the step in showing the
information that was generated by the

174
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,490
tour so in this case we applaud it with
interpreters and rate will just searched

175
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,230
and we found this information package
and was bored that simple okay maybe

176
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,000
some of you are familiar with something
longer I was quite a popular piece of

177
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,750
ransomware special about this was
actually encrypting your device

178
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,280
encrypting your sdcard so director
actually had his as the card encrypted

179
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:14,420
got some basic information ok there's a
risk order of 100 it's closer to various

180
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,579
totaling as your report only by the
International didn't find the test shows

181
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,910
a risky behaviour is okay it does no
encryption and decryption execution

182
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,280
cause its exit exists on user
permissions ok so bad practice of

183
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,110
development its unique device IDs so
it's doing is getting information about

184
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,769
the user gets them a GSM

185
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:45,329
and it also says that user utilizes Java
reflection I'm just went to skim through

186
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:52,399
this just analysis at the end with see
the report lists your permissions shows

187
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,549
the activities services broadcast
receiver says IP distribution what I

188
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,079
please try to contact so you get a
better understanding of the situation

189
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,529
here that what's important is that one
of the order is doctor onion so it

190
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:09,920
actually is that is using the toilet
work stations so that could be a bit of

191
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,949
a headache for the investigators and you
don't have the whole list but it shows a

192
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:18,929
whole list of reads so just by looking
at this report you can tell it as

193
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:25,488
parsing your entire device your entire
sdcard and seen one of the scene of the

194
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:29,420
fire to contain and what's more
important is that it's also raining

195
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,029
right so after reading everything starts
writing and the rate was doing was

196
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,029
trying to sync ripping your fights so
here we have confirmation that the

197
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:45,100
managers and directors device actually
is encrypted a semi confirmation would

198
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,829
be run into some books and it works in
the sandbox environment somebody's for

199
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:52,758
information in this case we're lucky we
see Toronto's SMS is no calls no data

200
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:59,179
within continent but so you have some
other information sensitive episod were

201
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:02,829
closed this is a useful information
together to avoid use the static

202
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:08,398
analysis later on as you can see you
where it shows your classes where the

203
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:16,059
calls were made to promotions were used
as well so this is all information that

204
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:22,020
we should gather and put in a report
gives you a screenshot and escape

205
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:30,990
upload it to customize it will show the
actual ok so when the report to start

206
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,060
generating the data as we go on we keep
filling up to date on her report and ok

207
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,540
so everything that any useful
information that we have after done

208
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,020
between airports usually what happens is
that we have to refer to it back either

209
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,940
in the future within the same incident
or when with when it comes to another

210
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:59,590
incident ok so the basic tools we use
any commercial use in this case we use

211
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,209
Redbox which is what many too many open
source there later we'll see a massive

212
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,730
amongst taken so that could be an option
as well basically be locker disconnect

213
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,660
the device and see the lots of to ADB
you can take the network connection

214
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,560
using TCP done you can hopefully develop
some custom to us what we recommend you

215
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,830
can also buy commercials in this case
you used Redbox I'm sure most of you not

216
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,970
read books on the money to explain this
so in this case I was startled emulator

217
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,800
we created Ms Lee Curtis to simulate as
much as possible

218
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,190
the device of the manager has his device
had initially we need to talk about some

219
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,650
photos to make sure that it was actually
encrypting them

220
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,890
books we applauded the application and
as you can see he gets the same

221
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,740
winningest manager this is a good sign
because it shows that most probably you

222
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,790
can do most of the work on on the
emulator rather than working on the

223
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,430
actual device I'm just gonna have a lot
interesting just to make sure we don't

224
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:14,020
damage anything for the director so as
you can see over here we have just four

225
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,300
hundred and seventy-four looks but as
the analysis continues its does nine

226
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,139
hundred and fifty 9500 locks blog
entries and this is mostly due to all

227
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,000
the file reader writes that were being
generated at the end Redbox will give

228
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,350
you a reports and if you scroll through
the report that the generated you can

229
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,090
actually see all of the reader writes
read operations and write operations

230
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,639
here we have a picture that was
encrypted so we can go in that last

231
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,130
picture and see if it was encrypted if
we try to decrypt it we work on that

232
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:54,250
picture was of course on that and
hopefully it will work and also generate

233
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,700
some other useful information

234
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,010
books here but here just gives you an
indication of 83 you have you can see

235
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,590
the actual file writes the final words
there's also met with connections to

236
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,780
have to look into that as well and was
nice bod write books that actually

237
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,610
doesn't do it anymore but we modified it
a bit to give you a JSON object at the

238
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,260
end and what's useful is that you can
integrate this JSON object and use it

239
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:33,150
within your analysis pretty sure and
also use this then you can just generate

240
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,990
your own terms of course these are you
can just open at the Mozilla and see all

241
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,310
the information that was generated by
droid books ok so we just carry on

242
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,418
giving the incident reports just carry
on populating the information we have

243
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,789
it's important to put useful information
that I just don't use formation just

244
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:57,139
dumping it but if you're not sure if the
information is useful when we should

245
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:05,449
dump it anyway now for static analysis
we're going to use standard tools apk to

246
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:12,440
text jargon to use in this case and J
league we just because it's easier to

247
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,830
present a decrease in the actual command
line but there are a whole bunch of

248
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,710
other tools that you could use I mean
underground as the popular one there is

249
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,220
word of injera fight instead of Dexter
jouret's think there are other compilers

250
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:35,190
gem as we said earlier you can create
your own custom towards as yesterday we

251
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:43,889
saw I'm not command thankful we started
off by checking the manifest usually

252
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:47,479
tell them to start off with the managers
and reduces the manifesto understand the

253
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,580
application as soon as I think it's
quite important to analyze the manifesto

254
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,080
understand what the application is doing
so we started off from the manifest

255
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,639
views they begin to get this stuff but
most importantly when it came to the

256
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:08,199
static analysis we were very lucky that
it was not obligated to at meetings a

257
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,320
lot easier not just that was not obvious
that it was written quite nicely when it

258
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,529
came to the names of the classes had not
one particular classes was a script was

259
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:25,419
most importantly as they told us was
using AAS CBC and acacias seven so

260
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:27,029
that's quite useful information

261
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,769
what's more even that nice and that this
was a Eureka moment tyrone was really

262
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,799
satisfied only saw this so this is not a
joke is that the actual artifacts so

263
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,759
this is one that's what we actually
handed so we're very lucky that he was

264
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,540
hard coded a lot of useful information

265
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,200
so he showed us how he encrypted as well
again what he needed to do was up to

266
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,450
skate but it for us he showed us what he
wasn't trippin so he wasn't encrypted

267
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:04,170
anything even here i mean could've just
used a different name for the website

268
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,230
for possible but he actually quite
decipher password so even when doing the

269
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,250
automated analysis can be very useful
because I mean if you're just dump it in

270
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:19,350
an automated analysis tool any safer
password JDM blah blah blah useful

271
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:26,330
information we could also see that he
was getting our so what we did here we

272
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,720
went to the static analysis we saw what
since the VPS were being called and we

273
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,850
went we went into these static analysis
to see where it was being called in

274
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,280
which class we found one particular
class that was u2's

275
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,070
here with you was getting the model
getting you may getting all sorts of

276
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:51,230
device information to get the main thing
but this was the Holy Grail this was

277
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,380
what we were looking for

278
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,720
actually gave us a method to show us how
to decrypt it so at least it was a nice

279
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,540
cybercriminals go good 'cause he was
actually depicting the device once we

280
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,379
would have paid but we didn't think so
what we did was we found a description

281
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,100
method over here so now if you think
about it we have options being used we

282
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,860
have the Egyptian key and we have the
decryption method so a lot of useful

283
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,240
information here

284
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,120
obviously we have to put this useful
information and to order parts we keep

285
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,000
dumping into reports of $5,000 being
encrypted encryption key maybe I should

286
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,610
have put that in bold and highlighted
and obviously we could copy and paste

287
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:44,300
the description method ok so their data
analysis and we did some research and we

288
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,649
need to propose an action to meet with
stakeholders and say listen this is what

289
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:57,130
we're going to do so tell us any
suggestions on what we're going to do

290
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:05,780
now with the information that we have
obviously we have the encryption

291
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,780
information we have the decryption key
so what we're going to do is we're going

292
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,670
to use this information to recover the
first of all we need to understand

293
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:21,730
around somewhere cuz its keeps prompting
up in this but the above will be tested

294
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,240
on an emulator on a test device

295
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,240
obviously we don't go immediately
testing on a on a device of our director

296
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,920
of constituent Thurs so we can try to
simulate as much as possible on an

297
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,559
emulator maybe this budget to come by
devices similar to the directors tried

298
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,990
convicted and work on that don't work on
the life

299
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:50,510
artifact so we install it on the
emulator here's why said which he did

300
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,030
and that's what we did was we use adb
shell we're lucky to be able if it was

301
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,720
another neighborhood had to use an
alternative method but in this case it

302
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,330
was enabled we managed to find the
package name of negative and to be

303
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,399
honest or to remove it so it'll be under
stalin was removed but this doesn't

304
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,580
solve anything i mean the fires were
still encrypted when you uninstall

305
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,600
it's not nice enough to do to decrypt
your files only if it was nice enough

306
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,810
but it was nice enough to give us enough
information I would say okay so the

307
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,970
action propose we need to meet up with
everyone involved and tell them what

308
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,010
we're going to do we tell them listen
the uninstallation works for decryption

309
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,510
we're going to partially and dot X files
as we saw it when equipping the first

310
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,070
was giving the extension . in see we're
going to decrypt the crib them using the

311
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,250
description method that was given to us
will work on a copy of the face of which

312
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,740
keep it even your group that fights want
to keep them just in case the

313
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,560
description doesn't work and we don't
have damaged even more and again we're

314
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,600
going to test and emulator or investor
base so we just created a simple Android

315
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,260
application we put the information that
we got from the other applications so

316
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,030
very simple for me in this was done in
one minute

317
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:12,639
copy and paste may be there were some
problems with the when we use the jdo we

318
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,000
didn't exactly decompile everything else

319
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,570
line-by-line but it took maybe one or
two seconds and it was quite

320
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,820
straightforward in this case ok I know
we just did a little method that parses

321
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:32,700
the vice president's record and gets
older daughter Nancy files you can see

322
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,600
on the emulator that the final was in
fact encrypt encrypted so we're going to

323
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,520
test these simple locker removal tool

324
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,760
we're going to tested on the emulator
when we just run the script which

325
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,920
personifies and runs the emulator we get
the demo picture always keeping the

326
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,440
encrypted file over there may be more
useful in fact the Senate over the

327
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,270
network to another device but in this
case we did a quick resolution we just

328
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:09,240
put it a copy of the increase of the
decrypted file itself up we downloaded

329
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,110
the file

330
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:19,399
just rename the file to JPEG remove the
Encino obviously doesn't work and the

331
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,210
final topping at work we got the image
back so this was good news for us we

332
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,370
couldn't just go and do something under
directors device we have to go as for

333
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,770
his permission to sign and a proven show
that this sort something might go wrong

334
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,730
we cannot guarantee that hundred percent
is gonna be safe but we did the due

335
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:45,720
diligence and we see that seems to be
okay okay once we run this tool under

336
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:52,410
directors device we just make sure we do
analyzing divisive it make sure that

337
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:57,160
there's no other traces no other files
that were dropped not nothing suspicious

338
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,900
we asked them to ensure that all of
these files are there restored the

339
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,929
simple procedure and at the end we have
the director who's happy device back you

340
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:09,030
can go back to the office and now it's
we have to go back to work to report

341
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,500
everything to say we will still have
work to do it since then hundreds of

342
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:20,110
sites over ok so we have to so we didn't
just do the recovering thats it

343
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,799
obviously we need to document everything
I'm not a huge fan of this but it has to

344
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,960
be done is very important that we
documented we say how we're covered this

345
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:34,840
this is how we got from the from the
reports to the resolution will solve

346
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,530
everything so all the information has to
be listed before I said I cheated a bit

347
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:47,260
and I use adb is not installed at all
there are many times have you got some

348
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,360
bloggers and the Google Play Store quite
a few movies to this one interesting way

349
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,059
that they found I just copied this tool
for the procedure was a list of the

350
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:00,250
procedure here what they did was add a
push the application from the Play Store

351
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,850
so

352
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,939
they had to go in the Play Store account
of the so on another computer on the

353
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,650
Play Store account of the director for
example they make install an application

354
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,750
that there's a way of putting it
directly on the device would simply

355
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,570
locker you can click the home button
when you click the home button have to

356
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,520
click quickly opened this application so
there's a chance for the first time and

357
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,340
then interrupted the simple doctor so if
anybody was not installed and we didn't

358
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,990
have these tools we probably would have
had to implement a similar method or

359
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:40,510
find some other alternative ok we're
closing the incident so we need to

360
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,140
generate reports some additional
information

361
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,419
who was attacked the target that we
involve any third parties and we get

362
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:52,039
contractors to help us because we are
not skilled enough contact ISPs and see

363
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:58,020
certs short description of the incidents
the results of your work was resolved

364
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,179
not to the end of the day

365
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,549
your main findings and recommendations
ok so let's say this incident took one

366
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:11,480
day one day when you think about it it's
not a short amount of time when you see

367
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:18,330
the amount of visitors or occurrences
that sea surface leaving for example if

368
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,510
you spend one day on each one you're
going to manage with a head count so

369
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:27,070
they haven't given the number of
incidents do they just want managed case

370
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:32,750
improvements analysis is proposed here
we give basic proposes today that the

371
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,150
company ok do you have a beaut being
grown device policy may be the director

372
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,240
was using his device for work as well as
was present device should consider doing

373
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,179
a deal bring your own device policy
should they have an MDM are similar to

374
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:51,510
that they can control everything company
devices should be back up the devices

375
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:56,480
again if it's not their property and
even back it up so they have to raise

376
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,150
these questions these kind of questions

377
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,330
it's obviously in this case it's proof
way we shouldn't allow untrusted

378
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,699
applications so I'm official
applications that are not from the Play

379
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,330
Store not trusted

380
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,220
we need to train our incident handlers
in this case they had no knowledge of

381
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,510
mobile incident handling so they would
have had trouble dealing with this

382
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:25,350
incident prevent similar events by
organizing of Venice raising campaigns

383
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:32,219
update to latest West Indies usual stuff
okay and also in this case the attackers

384
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,790
targeted so it might be a good idea to
forward the information to law

385
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:41,000
enforcement to see if they need they
need to go into further details to

386
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,340
investigate from the airport information
whether as he sits in this case and a

387
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,179
case of see so what's next party sources
said they were closed communities are

388
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,920
separate communities but they're they're
very involved in information sharing I

389
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,560
mean imagine this was happening country
X countrywide has a similar incident if

390
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,840
they have a report then obviously can
deal with it quicker and more efficient

391
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,659
way

392
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:13,600
ok but we also need to improve the
situation and the company unless we need

393
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,490
to improve the process we need to
improve the general process and a bigger

394
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,850
picture when it comes to mobile threats
incident happening before I showed you

395
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:27,590
the process of one specific where they
had nothing to do with mobile threats

396
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,330
incident handling so if that was the
president handing workflow that they

397
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,100
worked with what I would recommend after
dealing with this kind of incident is

398
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,610
that listing the tools that we use them
including them into the incident

399
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:45,709
handling workflow ok so we need to
include the towards the recovery tools

400
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,370
that we worked with you need to update
the workflow and what i think is most

401
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,939
important is a minute alternate so
important April 23 thanks to develop

402
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,020
scripts for repetitive tasks

403
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,650
maybe you need to come purchase
commercial tools and does this for us

404
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:06,120
the importance of the end of days we
need to reduce the time at which we

405
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,040
respond to an incident which was often
incident so as much as we can automate

406
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,509
we need to automate and also probably
after this incident this would be a good

407
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:25,159
time to us for more resources and more
training and more money so what would be

408
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,790
an ideal scenario in this kind of case
we said about automation before ideally

409
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,540
what would have happened in the
beginning is would have had a tool we

410
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:40,219
applauded Rab ka everything and and
behavior it points out the same here you

411
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:44,270
have the encryption floods encrypted
files here and we get older dustry luck

412
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:50,149
but useful information you have to have
the encryption key encryption method and

413
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:56,549
some other information obviously as was
mentioned yesterday by now secure at the

414
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,270
end of the day you always need human
intervention but I believe that as much

415
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:06,900
as we can we should ultimate especially
when it comes to do a similar to that

416
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,940
mean we saw and revision these kind of
tools that initially digger was quite a

417
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,640
lot of useful information

418
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:19,359
700 give us quite a lot of information
to start off but the more we can improve

419
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,890
understands the more we can work on them
and develop tools that will give us

420
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,100
useful and actionable information that's
most important not just dumping

421
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,210
information and saying okay now you see
if we can be provided actionable

422
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:40,460
information in an automated manner that
would be the additional can anyone

423
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:47,380
imagine what happened one year later to
this company executive going to similar

424
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:53,800
ransomware and but in this case we're
very lucky to have her ticketing system

425
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,470
incident handlers they just taped Rai
they were lucky enough that it

426
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:10,200
automatically from Android and thanks to
our incident report we have all of the

427
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,270
procedures that we need to take and
reduced the incident handling the

428
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:19,060
instant duration from one day to 30
minutes just because we had all the

429
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,970
information available

430
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:27,950
ok so I just repeat our requirements are
that we need to improve the process we

431
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,020
need to increase automation and we need
to improve opportunities that are

432
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,960
available and keep them up-to-date most
importantly and at the end of the day we

433
00:36:36,960 --> 00:37:11,559
need to reduce response and resolution

434
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:32,579
and especially when it comes to what
they're starting to do now they're

435
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,249
starting to focus mainly on Android
possess way to get most of the incidents

436
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:37,738
but we have a few

437
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:41,249
I was going to mention countries but
they shouldn't listen countries we have

438
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:45,279
some countries that have big budgets and
they have a lot of resources and yes

439
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:50,329
they are doing some progress on iOS but
they find a problematic especially with

440
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:53,529
versioning every time a new version
comes out they have to start the

441
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:58,299
research again they have to start their
incident handling process again so it's

442
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:09,400
it's a tough one

443
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:40,780
so we focused quite a lot on that but at
the end of the day we have certain again

444
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,340
I will not mention a country but there's
one particular season as two people have

445
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:50,110
a talk to people in their team and they
are quite older and more procedure now

446
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,380
so they don't have any tools or so
sometimes when the desperate they have

447
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,170
no other option they have no resources
down on money and they have two hundred

448
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,000
incidents so they work with what they
can we try to help them as much as

449
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,920
possible we go in there we teach them
but I mean if they are to don't just

450
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,080
have more balance they have many other
incidents so another problem is

451
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,230
educating the people and getting them
skills so they have to use what they

452
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:27,010
have in terms of sport or tools or exits
from om Sai RAM knows what would make

453
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:34,600
your job easier if if you could have a
wishlist stewards Williams automated

454
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,860
tools for incident responders I mean
there are i think im nervous for example

455
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,120
under these kind of two very good
they're ok they're online offline but

456
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,609
this kind of toys should be available
that's a maybe cheaply or more

457
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,400
affordably for this small especially
want for these small incident response

458
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,960
teams and maybe should come I don't
maybe Google can offer something but the

459
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,049
more automated it is the better it is I
think because

460
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:07,489
ok it's interesting to do what we did
over here we went deep diving we saw

461
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:12,009
static analysis we did human
intervention but at the end of the day

462
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:17,569
for incident hundreds automation is the
primary priority they cannot handle all

463
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:20,369
of the incidents they cannot do what we
did over here this was a one-off

464
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:25,289
critical information but when we're
dealing with I don't know one hundred

465
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:33,989
and you cannot really do this so
automation as a primary wish list

466
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:43,130
many of those prices because they're
prepared to even collect incidences what

467
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,299
is your experience with incidents
happening to individual users today even

468
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:55,929
in to reap rewards that's what she said
so therefore actually the initial so she

469
00:40:55,929 --> 00:41:00,459
says they deal with their constituents
are ok companies that are involved in

470
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:04,839
sensitive security but also to people
every country has their own research

471
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:11,788
National Research and the idea this was
started of back in the states and the

472
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:16,469
initial idea was to be the center of the
internet that's how they defined as he

473
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:23,719
served so yes we have people who have
their website where you can report stuff

474
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,689
and they do get one of reports where
people say I have been affected and

475
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:29,319
actually had

476
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:33,329
when you can have a small country but
sometimes when they have reports leaders

477
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:37,199
was very useful is that they just need
to search for the incident and forward

478
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,170
it even to the person maybe not the
technical part of the relevant parts on

479
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,539
what to do so that's the job of this
exhibit at the end of the day I did

480
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:53,079
numbers rising numbers of individual
reports yes number of reports are rising

481
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:57,809
but the ability of the sea search 200
them unfortunately I'm not racing is

482
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:03,719
quickly getting quite a little mad words
from mobile devices and unfortunately

483
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,019
have visited countries and I i asked
them specifically what do you do with

484
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:12,109
mobile instance and they say we have no
skills we have no tools and some time to

485
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:18,109
time but specific ones so they are
getting quite honest manner of their

486
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:23,400
questions

487
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:35,680
and maybe one for myself I know it's
very hard to predict the future but what

488
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,750
do you think

489
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,010
with with altered developments in the
last two days and just reports in a few

490
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,609
months

491
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:51,589
measures being built into platform
security being one of the prime focus

492
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:57,119
areas of newer versions of operating
system do you think that your job is

493
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:06,059
going to get easier or is too big we
mention that was discussing this

494
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:11,490
infected with something yesterday one
particular case that used to be found a

495
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:19,259
lot especially with SMS number which is
when you install an application and it

496
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,920
sends us a message for you in the
background and it's done it's money to

497
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,029
the charity of cybercriminals Google+
some countermeasures now in android

498
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:35,260
to counter this and they saw dropping in
this kind of attacks which relief for

499
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:39,569
instant answers so yes this kind of
improvements are critical was on one

500
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:43,730
part I would see their faces you have
the prevention but at the end of the day

501
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,809
we're still going to have incidence so
as much as we can prevent would prevent

502
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:52,619
it would make the life of incident and
raised here but we need to accept the

503
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:56,299
fact that they're always going to get
you but yes we can minimize as much as

504
00:43:56,299 --> 00:44:02,130
possible that's what we should do

505
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,170
let's think you can thank you
