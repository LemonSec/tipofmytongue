1
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,518
I welcome you to my time

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,590
currently I'm working at the University
of Vienna in the research group

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:28,419
cooperative systems or kuz my supervisor
professor peter has the next for

4
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:35,930
acronyms yeah that's why we called cozy
and I have to say I have to tell you I'm

5
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,309
doing conference hoping these days in
the past days there was an instructor at

6
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:44,218
the mention computer which is the nature
of the German HCI conference and there

7
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,520
we have PHD's clueless well where we had
like a little group with 10 people where

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,100
we had a very private discussion and now
I'm here with all of you very technical

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:04,939
audience and which is of course a bit
intimidating but also very great it's a

10
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:15,339
very great regarding my seizes I'm very
at the beginning so I am only done

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,539
having my topic and having my first
research plan but I hope to bring a new

12
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:26,459
facet into this symposium with my main
topic usable security wish I were also

13
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:48,079
introduced a bit my motivation is that
like all of you know the uncovering for

14
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,499
example of the global surveyor the
extent of the global surveillance by

15
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:58,689
dennis has led to a strong increase in
popularity of the Tor network which is

16
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,999
like the onion routing privacy network
but there are some problems like the

17
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:10,209
usability problems of the inner users
and participating in the network which

18
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:15,410
decreases the anonymity for all users
and there's a significant body of

19
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:22,090
related research about usability in 12
programs for desktop computers but not

20
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,990
for more by and in my PhD project

21
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,160
I want to make the contribution of
increasing the usability software apps

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,079
on mobile devices in order to increase
the overall and immunity for all users

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:45,780
as a recent events like the crisis with
the refugees for a donor haven't talked

24
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,110
to any refugees yet but I could for
example think of that that's also

25
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,040
something important for the refugees if
they want to communicate during this

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,700
journey I think that the users of mobile
apps for privacy will increase in

27
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:08,380
importance the next year's research
field is on the top I called it nobody's

28
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:17,269
about privacy that's drawing from
several feel myself and more coming from

29
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:22,460
the human-computer interaction side
probably most of you will come more from

30
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,680
the security and privacy side the main
underlying topic of my thesis like the

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:38,040
big circle is usable security and
privacy and I picked certain tool boxes

32
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,010
out of this big set which is mobile HCI
that's human computer interaction with

33
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:52,209
mobile devices and privacy enhancing
technologies the Tor network in my case

34
00:03:52,210 --> 00:04:03,900
security how many of you have heard of
usable security so far better chance for

35
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,450
me to tell you something about it when
you're designing secure systems of

36
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,690
course you can build in the best our
river and Lexus most secure connection

37
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,190
way but what is it worse if if nobody
can use it so if you if you don't bring

38
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,880
the human enter the loop during the
whole development cycle it's very hard

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,740
to have the most security you can have
in your system's likes most companies do

40
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,070
something like ok

41
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,170
rebuilt the secure product lets us use
just how how we can make it more secure

42
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:47,780
and usability evaluation of existing app
but most in most cases that's not enough

43
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,109
you have to bring the human in into the
loop from the beginning of the whole

44
00:04:52,110 --> 00:05:01,040
development cycle because you can build
more secure systems by starting with red

45
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,270
requirements and not making some
mistakes and even if you have like

46
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,299
experts and like all of you have
stumbled upon security usability flaws

47
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,820
in like the most popular applications
because sometimes it's just that you may

48
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,960
come in intentional mistakes it's not
that you don't know about you talk about

49
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,930
the field of that you are stupid or
something like this is just the system

50
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,720
could be more usable so it's not I am
most of the time that I users it's not

51
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,430
your fault it's just the system could be
designed better of course another

52
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,330
central fear of my penis is privacy
technologies in particular tour on your

53
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,450
writing network which is like center
around technology and EPS for accessing

54
00:05:53,450 --> 00:06:03,170
the Tor network 2009 and misusing said
that increasing the user may at the same

55
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,080
time you turn enhance anonymity you as I
said before for all users due to network

56
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,950
effect is like for me it would be easier
to hide and the crowd present present in

57
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,020
this room at the PhD school at the
mansion computer last week it would have

58
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:26,750
been harder because there were only 10
people and of course mobile HCI like

59
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:34,590
interaction of military action centers
device specifications mobile phones or

60
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,840
tablets have totally some totally
different interaction ways or

61
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,310
specifications like a desktop computer
for example you have smaller streams you

62
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,020
have a battery in which you have to

63
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,639
draw upon you have sensors and so on

64
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:02,220
applications of course every good visa
should have some research questions here

65
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,620
are my preliminary research questions
first of all I of course want to see

66
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,419
what she believed to problems sooner
users to participate in the tour network

67
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,639
on mobile devices and how can they be
overcome a special focus should be put

68
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,900
upon special usability problems during
installation setup because you can't use

69
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:29,318
the FSU kind of Stallard then how does a
context influence the user of the Tor

70
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,099
network on mobile devices other special
characteristics of the mobile context in

71
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:42,169
which the Tor network is used to say
context is the wide-field if you have a

72
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:49,250
look at mobile HCI research context like
there are people who have done like its

73
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,210
extensive literature review and put up
whole frames frameworks what is context

74
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,068
so probably should be like I should
specify that in the end the work in my

75
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:07,469
work and in which ways just this context
influence the torah beauty and reflect

76
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:13,599
on the user's behavior then I wanna have
a look at which special characteristics

77
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,430
can help to in and enhance the
functionality and usability of tour in a

78
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,380
reasonable way with emphasis on
reasonable way because of course I could

79
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,509
trick how fast is this leaves a walking
and maybe it's a risky situation but you

80
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:36,649
don't want your anonymity to know a lot
about you so ok so this should of course

81
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:44,179
be done without compromising the user's
anonymity and security

82
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:51,689
my research approach that I wanted to
review analysis and want to make some

83
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,420
requirement of wanna know what does the
user needs and what should i maybe have

84
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,610
a special look at then I wanted
affirmative user studies in the left

85
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,200
hand in the field because I thought of
course I can put an Android device in my

86
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,920
lap which will be which we will have
later this year but if everybody whys

87
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,829
why should I go out in the field and
have a look at how this how the apps

88
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,970
behave in the field this should be under
special consideration of mobile context

89
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:31,330
and those characteristics then ideally
I'd like to write some design principles

90
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,830
for mobile user privacy I could give to
developers of privacy apps for mobile

91
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:43,480
devices and of course I'm going to
implement improvement and in the end I

92
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,920
wanted to have summative evaluation
which in the HCI means like okay now

93
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,479
we've done all this work in the end I
want to check was this worth all the

94
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:02,420
hassle and total so far F three studies
planned but of course maybe if I find

95
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,599
something else to research or something
goes wrong maybe I want it will have to

96
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,709
do more and as I already mentioned we're
gonna have a cause the user trial later

97
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:20,250
this year it's probably a momentarily
and the building phase so ideally I want

98
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:27,670
to build some way to research usable
security the usable security of absence

99
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,339
in the lap so if somebody in Vienna's
interested in testing usability of

100
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:43,900
Sakura Sakura and animist apps
applications you can write me an email

101
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,420
some notes about related work of course
I'm not the first one to evaluate the

102
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:57,020
usability of triple occasions so far
there's a lot about usability on desktop

103
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:04,930
PCs in 2007 Clark and Ali examined
different application set-ups for

104
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,520
traditional PCs very most of you know
about or network and how to access it

105
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,770
back these times there was only like a
very model away you have to install the

106
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,750
button and the proxy and you have to
configure Firefox it was all very like

107
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:26,160
even expert made a experts made a lot of
mistakes and of course they found out

108
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,230
that the most usable version install in
one browser which led to reveal

109
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,650
development in the top as abundant as we
know it today but I really liked about

110
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,720
this one is that it was not research for
the business we say in Germany and thank

111
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,680
you research something and then it ends
up in as some paper and some like drawer

112
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,770
but no the development team said hey
cool we did some usability evaluation

113
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,780
that tell us how we could make it better
and then we're gonna do it so i i really

114
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,110
like that of course there were also some
flaws found in the tour brother bundle

115
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,970
this time for example that there was a
very long lunch time and so on and you

116
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,060
couldn't distinguish with it the Firefox
browser open to the top rosamund and

117
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:21,500
this led to some improvements and I
guess those are many free studies other

118
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:29,160
reason the tribe as usual as it is today
of course coming from the network side

119
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,510
you can also do like some usability
evaluation about the network metrics

120
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:41,100
from Berlin did this in 2012 and final
okay it's no surprise that the higher

121
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:48,670
you that there's a high user frustration
potential due to delay ok and the study

122
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,378
I found most interesting but
unfortunately it's also

123
00:12:53,379 --> 00:13:03,359
study but outside and Shias and research
the usability of torn Android device and

124
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,589
they found several usability flaws for
example an entry to feed off the EPS

125
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:19,559
technical language and insecure options
that risks security and privacy interest

126
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,749
in which I wanna mention on a separate
slide generalized touristic Swanner

127
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:29,119
unanimity systems that's the outcome
usable usable security research can give

128
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:37,939
mystics our guidelines which are
generalizable for our security systems

129
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:42,829
so installation procedure operation like
I said before if you can't install it

130
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:50,219
you can't use it should be aware of the
tradeoffs for example if you increase

131
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,409
network latency it could be you could
pay the price of decreased anonymity and

132
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:00,529
you have to say why not how social
security measures should be explained in

133
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:09,049
an understandable language so much about
related work my starting point of course

134
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,459
I could have a lot of starting price
does a lot of anonymity apps for mobile

135
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:18,758
devices I want to start with our boat on
Android atop rocks look at that and

136
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:25,739
probably or web browser which works over
or boat but there's currently in

137
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:31,569
development as a fox which is a torrid
enable Firefox's long-term substitute

138
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:38,509
for that's in development right now I
put the links in this night sorry if

139
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,720
you're interested in that you can you
can research there are you can have a

140
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,749
look at the link there's also the on
your browser for iOS but I think it's

141
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:53,559
also but you have to pay anything one
Europe for it I'm more interested in the

142
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,800
apps for Android ok

143
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,479
here's outline of the plant studies I'm
just gonna be really quick about that I

144
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,430
wanna do an online questioner to
identify requirements of the user base

145
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,399
then I want to do the lab study on the
field study and also a summit of

146
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:20,329
studying what's also may be interesting
for you if you doing user studies with

147
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:23,989
mobile devices you can always ask
yourself do I want to do it in the

148
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,140
laboratory or in the office I mean a
laboratory can also be your office if

149
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,880
you close the door or do you want to
bring it into the field the question or

150
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,329
field always depends what's more
important and that it's like most as

151
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,260
realistic as it can be or do you want to
control all the factors that can happen

152
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,060
I mean if the user gets hit by a car
while walking over the street and having

153
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,040
a look at you I guess that's not that
that's not another that's not the

154
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,630
perfect controls you can have in the
laboratory so you have different

155
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:05,709
advantages and disadvantages and if and
why is not as important as the wind and

156
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:14,920
Hall coming to the expected outcome that
was a question I was asked last week but

157
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,550
what's gonna come out of your thesis
unfortunately I don't have i don't have

158
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,469
any findings that since I'm still at the
very beginning beginning of my seizes

159
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:32,040
course I wanna provide a list of
requirements for more weight or use it

160
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,920
in the HCI usability engineering cycle
in the first place

161
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:46,110
how do users use tour boat or ebbs and
what do they want of course I wanna

162
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,670
provide an increased usability off of
the arabs saw in the real world I'm

163
00:16:51,670 --> 00:17:00,880
gonna be able in the perfect I'm gonna
be able to program reprogram interface I

164
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,390
don't know how I'm gonna do what exactly
I'm gonna do there yet but i wanna have

165
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,929
some get some insights about the role of
context and more usable privacy and of

166
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,250
course I want to provide some guidelines
to heuristics for developers of those

167
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:27,540
apps right about my status so I started
last year end of 2014 I'm done with

168
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:34,520
choosing my topic so far I already did
an extensive literature review but of

169
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,860
course there's there's always more I'm
reading about context and mobile HCI how

170
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:48,408
does context influence the but I want to
start with the first study requirement

171
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:52,530
analysis and then go on from there

172
00:17:52,530 --> 00:18:00,280
issues having right now with all this
planning business planning with my

173
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,980
target group in the beginning I said my
motivation is that tourists are gaining

174
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,970
a wider audience right now that would
mean that I'm not only asking experts

175
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,860
are not only experts on my target group
but also it's always interesting to us

176
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,928
experts about their opinion maybe I
wanna research boys I guess that depends

177
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:24,630
on my my

178
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,900
setup and of course that also depends
influences motivations and goals and use

179
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,560
a chain areas I'm dealing with which is
the base for a good HCI research and as

180
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,129
already mentioned several times

181
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,850
context what's context in my case is
that only their surroundings like noise

182
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,020
or movement or other distractions are
also specific situations with the high

183
00:18:50,020 --> 00:19:00,670
risk for example the border and ending
up and some camp I don't know ok thank

184
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:07,220
you for your I don't know what to say
and if you want to ask some questions

185
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,760
you can ask me questions I failed to put
my email address on this slide but I

186
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,550
have some cards here and if you're
interested in my email address come and

187
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:39,899
say hi and get one of my my cards thank
you

188
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,490
I wanna make a suggestion since I know
you were here a lot of guests from

189
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,830
companies and if you and of course
that's a very science based talk I would

190
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,310
be interested if usable security is an
issue and your company or wherever

191
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:01,480
you're working and if you've heard of it
or if it would be interesting for you it

192
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,080
would be something which would interest
me if you don't have questions for me

193
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:15,159
but of course you can ask me anything

194
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,000
I have a question security

195
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,670
contrary topics and most users to just
click anything on the Arabian Sea yes

196
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:36,170
yes yes yes ok and do you have any ideas
for improving security usability that

197
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:44,310
the user is aware of the security
problems in Europe in your topic about

198
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:50,710
the contrast between security and
usability I would make the counter I

199
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,640
would say in contrary it's very
important that secure EPS also usable

200
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,180
because otherwise you just make
unintentional mistakes which leads to

201
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,460
security breaches so I think that's very
important to bring visibility into it

202
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,730
and of course my visa stopping wants to
make a contribution but they're also

203
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,840
like this a lot of research also but how
do we communicate knowledge about

204
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,040
security to the users also in terms of
pop-up messages or there's also research

205
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,320
about ok we can show everything in
pop-up messages but at some point the

206
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,730
user we'll just click the X on the right
side it's just that's a very interesting

207
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,940
topic and it draws a lot of from
technology like where does the annoyance

208
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,890
kids and get as high that the user just
closes the program and buyers from from

209
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:43,390
another company I don't know I hope I
can make a major contribution to of

210
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:51,399
course I want to increase usability and
security

211
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:57,899
request has been

212
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,010
thanks again thank you
