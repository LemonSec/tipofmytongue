1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,969
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to announce the first</font>

2
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:16,610
afternoon session which is again about

3
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:20,419
codes because today is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the developers</font>

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:25,189
say and so we we are expecting a few new

5
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:28,429
inside smell<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yuri from echard about</font>

6
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:31,939
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really playing with somebody else's</font>

7
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:34,780
code so that hopefully it will be more

8
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:34,780
secure of words

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:46,210
can you hear me<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes but I think each</font>

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">time I had to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a talk in the</font>

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,650
conference each time I have the slot

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,629
observant it's a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I have a</font>

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,480
mission in my life to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:01:00,880
entertaining as possible so i will do my

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:04,660
best I promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I am Tebow and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,010
am as a CEO and founder of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sharm so</font>

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:11,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll young what we do is we try to very</font>

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,610
much look into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,920
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> security to make them more</font>

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,780
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so very much on the sauna</font>

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,920
sweat and make them more secure and

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,050
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that we have been</font>

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">having and I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to share this</font>

24
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,940
question with you today and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:35,140
purpose of my talk now the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,270
all about mobile application security so

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,720
first why do we need security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,270
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> application one because it is</font>

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,350
doing something secure like encryption

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:50,530
education can find a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,240
ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this or because the mobile</font>

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">application is having something secure</font>

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,550
they could be an encryption an

34
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,850
encryption key well it can be as well

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:03,759
the code itself because you don't want

36
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,360
the code to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be duplicated easily because</font>

37
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,190
you spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time to code it ok so</font>

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,370
you want application you want security

39
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,520
in your mobile application how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

40
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:19,030
it to make it difficult for a hacker to

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,580
go through your application<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font>

42
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,430
morning we had a very interesting talk

43
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,410
about how your code can be exposed with

44
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,100
the various techniques like static

45
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:33,040
dynamic analysis and a strong way to

46
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:37,420
protect your code platform i would say

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,780
coding it properly is to add software

48
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:45,019
harbin such as obfuscation or what I

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:49,910
named runtime security protections

50
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:52,700
the question I have today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

51
00:02:49,910 --> 00:03:04,850
confident are you that your software

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:08,600
hardening is effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if I ask</font>

53
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:12,650
the question differently is how tough

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:18,200
will be for hacker to go through my

55
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:22,670
binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's see let's let's try</font>

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,280
to answer this question today so you may

57
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,220
tell me there are plenty of tools out

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,120
there doing some very nice vulnerability

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,700
analysis of mobile applications and its

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,510
best is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's using as input the binary</font>

61
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,030
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I put some example and so if they</font>

62
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:45,500
are not or<font color="#E5E5E5"> if all of them are not there</font>

63
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,150
but now<font color="#CCCCCC"> cq45 palio are all claiming that</font>

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,860
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some vulnerability</font>

65
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,990
analysis that's true<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they are doing</font>

66
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,890
vulnerability analysis they are looking

67
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:01,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">for we are behavior we are looking for</font>

68
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:05,059
malware but are they are showing my

69
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:10,130
question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the obfuscation about the</font>

70
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:12,740
runtime kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> collections no actually</font>

71
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,829
for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tours Go Fish case the</font>

72
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,440
obfuscation the divine findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> auntie</font>

73
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">tampering are or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pain for these tools</font>

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:26,270
because they make it makes them work

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,790
difficult on my side while we're like

76
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:32,120
you is to focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I don't care</font>

77
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:35,450
about the man I would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:40,850
the r-mo is<font color="#CCCCCC"> thick strong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough as I</font>

79
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:43,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">would like this to be okay so I just</font>

80
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,380
booted picture but I should have put

81
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">this picture I think it's more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on with</font>

82
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:53,590
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> symposium but the concept is</font>

83
00:04:48,500 --> 00:05:01,540
the same how thick is my shield

84
00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:03,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so one thing if I would like to</font>

85
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,600
separate security protection in two

86
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,750
families the one that the tools i was

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,080
mentioning before hand are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i named</font>

88
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,990
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior analysis you have to make</font>

89
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,690
sure that the behavior is appropriate

90
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay every is important when you seek</font>

91
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:26,560
your mobile application but on my side

92
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,110
the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardening PR nature is</font>

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,850
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> tombstone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a functional</font>

94
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,770
point of view and a good practice in

95
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,660
development is when you want something

96
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,430
when you want to create something<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to</font>

97
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply something on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code is good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

98
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:46,150
have a test against it right but if if

99
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:52,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's pair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net returns now how do you do</font>

100
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:54,880
it the second thing is obfuscation it's

101
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,490
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> black and white we could even make</font>

102
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,440
a movie of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty shades of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> education</font>

103
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,750
right thing is it's not is it office

104
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,350
gated or not you can officiate a

105
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,780
different River you can obfuscate do

106
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,530
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> code the symbols strength</font>

107
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,599
wherever the only obfuscation we are

108
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,599
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a lot of granularity and</font>

109
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,240
when you want to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> on mobile</font>

110
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,730
application some software happening in

111
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,460
your mobile application you want it at a

112
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:34,720
certain level right so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

113
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:38,020
about this clan right so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are a</font>

114
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,000
security analyst like a laboratory doing

115
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,060
a chi sao mobile payment security

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,380
evaluation I think you have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

117
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,130
from you l today on the right of

118
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:52,360
laboratory<font color="#E5E5E5"> verde to the job what they do</font>

119
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:58,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it takes a binary and they have no</font>

120
00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:01,900
choice of doing a manual inspection<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

121
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:07,270
so how does the manual inspection look

122
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:12,340
like inspections look like look like

123
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:14,378
this so you apply the technique that we

124
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,989
had this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take the pine away</font>

125
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,960
and then these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some bars you</font>

126
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:25,930
decompile you have tools for this and

127
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:29,109
you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this so now you have two</font>

128
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,210
scenarios you have the lucky one and an

129
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:36,550
unlucky one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will start with the</font>

130
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:39,638
lucky one the lucky one is behind a

131
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,639
white box situation in other words you

132
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,020
know the code so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the code and</font>

133
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you have the corresponding</font>

134
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:51,008
binary and you want to check if the

135
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,490
software hardening has been

136
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:57,879
appropriately implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> or apply to</font>

137
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:03,039
the binary so you have the chance of I

138
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:06,190
know where to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at event that it's</font>

139
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite painful but at least you have a</font>

140
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:14,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">lead it takes some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

141
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:19,089
like the black box the black box is

142
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:24,219
someone gives you the binary binaries

143
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:30,400
megabytes of data and you have to start

144
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:31,870
the walk from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's time for</font>

145
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,598
you to walk and to take some time

146
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">because one you don't know where to look</font>

147
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,019
at so you have to understand what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

148
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,360
doing imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is obfuscated it</font>

149
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:47,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">will take you time to have a look into</font>

150
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it will be necessary non</font>

151
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,449
comprehensive you cannot check

152
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,660
everything you won't be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

153
00:08:52,449 --> 00:09:03,609
everything it's impossible it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tedious</font>

154
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:06,520
and at this point right so if I can be

155
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,610
obsessed with blood I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

156
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:13,170
this approach is<font color="#CCCCCC"> non effective</font>

157
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,600
and I can speak because in initial we

158
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,760
are doing this kind of analysis and we

159
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,620
know the pain that it can be sometimes

160
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:28,290
so we try to find another<font color="#CCCCCC"> way a better</font>

161
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:31,560
way and this better way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll use some</font>

162
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,510
automation but when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were thinking</font>

163
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how we could apply a better way</font>

164
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:40,350
we're giving this requirement to us

165
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:44,880
comprehensiveness is one of the top

166
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:49,170
requirements why being partial when we

167
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:53,100
can be comprehensive remoted it very

168
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:56,910
visual why because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's too verbose</font>

169
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,240
it is called the eyes is a fantastic

170
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:04,680
tool for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security analyst we'll see</font>

171
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it goes like and we wanted this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font>

172
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use I will say why after walls and we</font>

173
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:14,370
didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool say yes it is figure</font>

174
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,640
or no is not secure everyone is asking

175
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,920
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'm sorry as a security expert</font>

176
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,569
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot answer this question I</font>

177
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:28,140
can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if there is some level of</font>

178
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:31,589
protection but you don't want creating

179
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,709
the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application has to know what</font>

180
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:38,160
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security level Iran's I cannot</font>

181
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:41,609
decide for him so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a black</font>

182
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,480
and white so how does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> look how does</font>

183
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:48,990
it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it look like this so just</font>

184
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:54,089
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google Chrome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this and we simply</font>

185
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:56,339
take as an input the APK<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so IDK you</font>

186
00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:02,010
just upload it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here we have a bunch</font>

187
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:04,890
of APK so you upload the<font color="#E5E5E5"> APK and then we</font>

188
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:08,370
will process APK so we will automate

189
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:11,640
here we are automating the<font color="#CCCCCC"> t copulation</font>

190
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,890
that is s only now while we do after

191
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:19,529
that and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take all the piece</font>

192
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:21,930
of code and we will analyze the code for

193
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:24,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">each piece of code we</font>

194
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:28,439
apply a set of heuristics so the

195
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is not to claim that the fish</font>

196
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,970
occasion is from poor guard or oxen or

197
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,089
whether you want this one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

198
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,920
interesting if signature<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this would</font>

199
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signature bass but it can be</font>

200
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,660
circumvented very easily now the idea

201
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:49,319
here it applies a set of heuristics so

202
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:54,600
we follow up the aristocratic will

203
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:58,950
target some specific obfuscation and as

204
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,839
al from of it is this so on the left you

205
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:05,130
have your list of apks also the ones

206
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,380
that's where the analysis is done air in

207
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,890
the bidder you have this visual view<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

208
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,320
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about so this graphical view</font>

209
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:17,550
gives you a full of a view of your

210
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:21,420
binary and<font color="#CCCCCC"> each each tire it's a piece</font>

211
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:23,939
of code you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> kuro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we talked</font>

212
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the curls afterwards and on the</font>

213
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:31,080
right you have the binary but in the 35

214
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,660
is the exact input that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had</font>

215
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">previously in my example so you have all</font>

216
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:44,310
the piece of code so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you walk</font>

217
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:47,190
with this but first as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see they</font>

218
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:49,439
are closed each<font color="#CCCCCC"> tile each tire has been</font>

219
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,010
posted with the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> early stakes and</font>

220
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,070
each time the heretic gave like I found

221
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,470
something or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't find anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

222
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,420
so after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you move your mouse</font>

223
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:05,490
on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the kind of information</font>

224
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:08,699
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> will form into it so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

225
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,000
see here we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100,000 of obfuscation</font>

226
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,970
doesn't mean that it is obfuscated as a

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">maximum it means that where we found the</font>

228
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">most efficient is the binary is this one</font>

229
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:25,410
hard puzzles and you can compare for the

230
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:27,720
rest look at a district or view how much

231
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:32,550
the different pieces of code where

232
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,760
differently handled the mazes so the

233
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:41,130
doctor the darker the tire

234
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:43,830
more appreciation into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so after</font>

235
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:46,710
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot stop your analysis here</font>

236
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:50,610
right but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can do is you just</font>

237
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:53,520
click on tire and then you would jump

238
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:56,940
you will jump to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corresponding piece</font>

239
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,390
of code here we go so you have this tab

240
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,660
on top so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can very much jump from</font>

241
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:08,250
the graphical view to the code and vice

242
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:10,949
versa so<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhaust as an example here we</font>

243
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,230
can find we can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the string that</font>

244
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,960
we can that would be highlighted the

245
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,030
string has been officiated<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance or</font>

246
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,100
modification is just an example so it

247
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:24,030
sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with non-ascii carcass</font>

248
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is why a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take said pay</font>

249
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,370
something to it well this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

250
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:33,180
easy simple example it shows you how it

251
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:37,500
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we look at the code</font>

252
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,349
symbols names and so on and each<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

253
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,330
you can go on the right and see where is

254
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,360
the corresponding file so this

255
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:49,260
corresponding file is highlighted way

256
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,230
okay here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can very much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump</font>

257
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,590
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one wall to the other and make your</font>

258
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:59,430
analysis in an effective way and when

259
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:01,950
you select<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right you will</font>

260
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,170
have the corresponding at the

261
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:07,800
corresponding tire that will be

262
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:12,479
highlighted<font color="#CCCCCC"> in blue okay so you know</font>

263
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:16,109
where it is located in to the binary so

264
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:21,060
when we use this tool to do our analysis

265
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:23,310
what we try to do is to to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

266
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,560
specific area in the binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

267
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:29,790
packages specific libraries whatever you

268
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,040
want to name it and and you want you may

269
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,939
be to have a specific look at it so what

270
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,469
you do is with a tool you can hear if

271
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't know which package belongs to</font>

272
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:45,600
you go on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top and you see the</font>

273
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:48,510
name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> package okay and when you do</font>

274
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,680
the package like you just have to go to

275
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,980
the corresponding fault

276
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,279
a is what we do here so you go to the

277
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,010
corresponding folder and clicking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

278
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:02,580
folder<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just simply tell you where</font>

279
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,880
the tires are within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folder and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

280
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:09,270
can very much move up and down into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

281
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,689
analysis in order to focus on a specific

282
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:16,890
path or having a broader look at it and

283
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:22,500
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it extremely useful and</font>

284
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:26,850
efficient to walk like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this another</font>

285
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,200
feature that we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this one that</font>

286
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,970
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> a package that would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

287
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">depth of appreciation and obviously</font>

288
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:37,620
there is notification<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so one other</font>

289
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,270
thing that we've found<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful and put</font>

290
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,890
your views but is to use a search engine

291
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so search engine is on top right</font>

292
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:52,230
okay and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to look at a</font>

293
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:55,050
specific functions or specific names but

294
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,000
you just type it okay here is a banking

295
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,640
application as you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that payments</font>

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,830
and you have for the fire and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

297
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:05,520
very much look at them specifically and

298
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:09,510
after that identify where they are in

299
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,599
the graphical view and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

300
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:18,869
you have in the tile is the tile is the

301
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:20,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">33 file of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

302
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,399
can play and see what other keywords you

303
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,698
can find the application and the less

304
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:34,960
officiated the application the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> grid</font>

305
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:37,149
you will have into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

306
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,279
when you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a mobile</font>

307
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:40,899
application like we do now there is

308
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,390
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely useful</font>

309
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:45,459
and particularly to understand what the

310
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,490
application is doing there are strings

311
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,549
the strings is a business suite of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

312
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:56,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">six-week the city on a list so this why</font>

313
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:58,840
we took particular care to look at the

314
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:02,799
string so you have the tab strings

315
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:06,100
dedicated one where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we gathered</font>

316
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,649
all the information we could get about

317
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,260
the strings and you can very much look

318
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:13,928
at it and see what are the string

319
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,658
obfuscate it and what are the skin the

320
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:21,250
string that have not been officiated and

321
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,809
you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some sensible way to look</font>

322
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:30,159
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on this one but the</font>

323
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:32,408
application is doing how it works so if

324
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:37,179
i go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation I would</font>

325
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:39,340
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you how it can be used so i</font>

326
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:42,850
would like to show you two examples so i

327
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,189
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have a torch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about banking</font>

328
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,439
application interim so here we played

329
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,590
with some other banking application<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

330
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,169
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

331
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:57,220
difference is you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> between one</font>

332
00:18:53,169 --> 00:19:01,450
good application and one not as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

333
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first one so first the graphical</font>

334
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:09,730
things so here you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of</font>

335
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:12,309
one or the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this then we can</font>

336
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:16,360
obviously system to simply wrote over

337
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:20,620
here right impossible so let's have a

338
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at how we work on it so first you</font>

339
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,610
take this first example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

340
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,059
do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> depth security analysis I don't</font>

341
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,668
have the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this today but you can</font>

342
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:35,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">see it's pretty spread okay</font>

343
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:39,610
interestingly you have these three lines

344
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rose so in the middle therefore</font>

345
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,158
when it's about banking application

346
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:48,010
nobody i have 0 is over the same is GM s

347
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,190
cube google mobile services that is

348
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,680
more obfuscating that noise so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

349
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the case here well when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

350
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,760
rest the level of obfuscation is not

351
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,770
quite so it is very spread looking at

352
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,379
the strings so the swing tab we could

353
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,139
see that none of them were educated only

354
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,940
the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the five swear officiated</font>

355
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:16,480
but the renaming was not very strong

356
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we could very much look into the</font>

357
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:26,020
code and actually put our grid and

358
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:31,000
analyze analyze it you take the second

359
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:33,100
example much<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet your job routing it to</font>

360
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,280
it I won't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a perfect</font>

361
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,250
appreciation but at least everything was

362
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,910
clean name in a proper way all the

363
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:46,030
sensitive strings we're officiated

364
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,490
rename different as they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> included</font>

365
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,950
as well so then they were none sensible

366
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:55,420
so we couldn't understand properly what

367
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:59,650
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you and generally</font>

368
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:02,620
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say the Java hacker for</font>

369
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:07,270
this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could say that it more is</font>

370
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:09,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">more difficult than the previous one as</font>

371
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,070
a side effect because there is always a

372
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:16,419
side effect of security so I find it

373
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:18,970
interesting as a security expert this

374
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,800
one is for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fish kidding right but</font>

375
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,870
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no structure there is nothing I</font>

376
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,970
don't know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at when I see</font>

377
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,209
the classical view right where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

378
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,610
maybe I can go to the google google

379
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:34,660
mobile services platform it there is

380
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:39,790
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Chum tube to my eyes when</font>

381
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:42,100
you look at this single one neat job we

382
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:45,220
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that attention has been taken on</font>

383
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,219
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts but this is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

384
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,710
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at to be fair it's a bit is</font>

385
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,860
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me where to look at so it should</font>

386
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the downside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the security so I am</font>

387
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">NOT saying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it should not be</font>

388
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:01,870
appreciated and think that security has

389
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:07,210
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there is always downside</font>

390
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:09,250
you need to be aware of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's a</font>

391
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,380
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we found it useful with</font>

392
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:16,809
the squash court view is a visioning

393
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:19,000
because when it's about releasing a

394
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,899
mobile application with some security

395
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,370
into it positioning is nightmare you can

396
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,490
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> your manual inspection or you can use</font>

397
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,919
this tool and you can do a proper check

398
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:34,330
on let's say the rational three dot six

399
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:38,470
dot six but next week you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

400
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:40,330
dot seven and after that 809 the 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

401
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,190
you about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the manual is a manual</font>

402
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,409
inspection of this kind of analysis each

403
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:50,230
time no nobody does that so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

404
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything okay that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be fine but</font>

405
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:57,580
you cannot be the confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> models here</font>

406
00:22:51,850 --> 00:23:01,780
at least with this visual view it's very

407
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:04,149
quick you put it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool and you</font>

408
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,809
can see it includes the same it should

409
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:09,850
lose the same it should I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

410
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,309
gain a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good level of confidence how much</font>

411
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:16,449
it changed from one person to the other

412
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:20,320
and if you see that some critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots</font>

413
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:23,260
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed it can trigger an action of</font>

414
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:32,020
looking deeper into it so you have this

415
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:37,420
inside so now we stop stop Maya told by

416
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:40,270
this is this new approach with a third

417
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:44,320
level of automation and after that and

418
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:47,440
security analyst you can go more in

419
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,480
depth it's very important why because we

420
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,150
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a security analyst</font>

421
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,480
analyst you will find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you go</font>

422
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">straight to the point you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

423
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,740
global overview that brings you to the

424
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:05,649
right level of information to start you

425
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:07,960
on a list where you are good at and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

426
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,610
comprehensiveness is something quite

427
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,160
important

428
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:16,990
because you have at least cover the

429
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:20,080
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but we didn't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

430
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:23,559
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new approach to security</font>

431
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,780
analyst because initial we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

432
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:29,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that something is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important when</font>

433
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:33,280
building the right security is to avoid

434
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:38,020
the speed between the expert and the

435
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:42,010
non-expert why it doesn't have nobody

436
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:44,620
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other so how to i would</font>

437
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,840
say show the value of what has been done

438
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,629
when protection has been done by

439
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,209
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysts of security expert we</font>

440
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:55,660
we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to other people</font>

441
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:59,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> experienced but aware people how</font>

442
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:03,580
much you can get inside into it so maybe

443
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:06,340
non expect people won't do the depths in

444
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,830
depth realities but with this first

445
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,129
level of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information they get a lot of</font>

446
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:17,530
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have them join us on what's</font>

447
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:20,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in there it helped them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well</font>

448
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:24,070
to reach a certain level of benchmark

449
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,780
why because the automation is agnostic

450
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:29,049
you will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different outcome</font>

451
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:31,660
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the security analyst here</font>

452
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:34,870
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a kind of general benchmark</font>

453
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,630
and we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important</font>

454
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,719
to have let's say oppositional process

455
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,929
in place it is what we wanted to achieve

456
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,450
here with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new way of working and</font>

457
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:52,950
looking at mobile application security

458
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:52,950
thank you for you

459
00:25:54,669 --> 00:26:02,200
thanks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot for that in-depth view in</font>

460
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:08,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">the current version of the tool if there</font>

461
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:12,100
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there specific question visible is</font>

462
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:15,940
that yes checker tool and a tool that's

463
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:19,658
available offline or will vs eps be

464
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:24,159
checked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed on your service now</font>

465
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:28,989
today what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are considering is you can</font>

466
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:32,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on your own desktop or laptop so</font>

467
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:34,659
offline we are just wondering if this

468
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:38,080
make sense to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it on the SAS model</font>

469
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:40,480
that is purely a a way to deploy it but

470
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,939
it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not need to be online to walk it</font>

471
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,619
can walk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standalone way so it's</font>

472
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,809
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the people needing</font>

473
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:52,959
this tool to tell us what they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

474
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,609
now here at so far as i know sooo hear

475
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,320
that you're basically showing the decks

476
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:58,989
information from the APK which you can

477
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">get so these strings the methods</font>

478
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:05,200
whatever how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with the apks</font>

479
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,019
which are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only obfuscating but are</font>

480
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,450
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example packed and protected on the</font>

481
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:12,909
native level I mean it's coming right

482
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,769
now more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> often that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the let's</font>

483
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,239
say not to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not the only benign</font>

484
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:17,710
applications are using these kind of

485
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:19,690
protections about the mail or as well

486
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,509
and how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to analyze that</font>

487
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,609
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two I think it's care of to</font>

488
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:26,529
us to live with the little with the

489
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:31,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">protection that they will have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face</font>

490
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:33,820
it will have to face so what I mean it's

491
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,309
each time there is difficulty we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

492
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,980
see a way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> overcome it it's a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

493
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:41,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thick we put in place can I say</font>

494
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,269
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are exhaustive today we are</font>

495
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:47,379
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be exhaustive so it will</font>

496
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:51,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> constant work for this but there is</font>

497
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:54,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">always a way to analyze the binary from</font>

498
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:55,809
here we started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> static you will see</font>

499
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:59,980
that there will be some other versions

500
00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:03,340
of future multi atoms dynamic but there

501
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:05,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">is always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to analyze</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard we are</font>

502
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,860
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> phases you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> filmed a different level</font>

503
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of protection</font>

504
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:16,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have questioned technical several</font>

505
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,309
questions so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you block on this</font>

506
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:23,000
picture yet what does it represent a

507
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:25,670
piece of code so a class method when you

508
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,250
compile<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Jesus number you have an all</font>

509
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:34,160
this piece of code yeah like basic block

510
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:36,799
method class exact so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it basic</font>

511
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,740
block<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually or is it when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

512
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:43,010
basic block like control flow park or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

513
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">demo I would after your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> face of the</font>

514
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:47,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">corporation is this assembly it's</font>

515
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,940
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the structure of the</font>

516
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">binary in indie film chunk and we we</font>

517
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:56,540
take the smaller strength we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

518
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:59,510
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how do you assess the</font>

519
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:03,379
application level for instance if i

520
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:05,570
write my I dental class name not in the

521
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:09,559
right name but I name my class like a

522
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,780
and method B yeah in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your representation</font>

523
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:16,010
will be like a publication without even

524
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:18,049
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prager</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the car it's a it's</font>

525
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,500
all related to this very thick we have

526
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:24,200
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> holistic will target</font>

527
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,860
specific of education or specific way to

528
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:33,770
name functions name to coat the symbols

529
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:35,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to 22 right to name a string</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

530
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:39,110
like for instance if i write my I don't

531
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:43,850
drink in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian yes will it recognized</font>

532
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:47,449
that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> application or not in dark</font>

533
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:52,340
inside inside like or English version

534
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's a good question I think for</font>

535
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocean I feel I will ask for the guy</font>

536
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,990
in charge of the heretic because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

537
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:03,620
want to give you an answer but yes a

538
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:07,100
horrific had to be properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> built so</font>

539
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,409
basically if when applying the tool to a

540
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:12,139
regime based and if we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

541
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:16,130
strength is actually envision and the

542
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:19,010
horrific has been poorly considering

543
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,630
this that we have to update it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

544
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,240
it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a cop</font>

545
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:28,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">work to make sure that the heretic are</font>

546
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:30,470
in line with real obfuscation so yeah I

547
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,210
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really found was clear is</font>

548
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,750
for me it's very important to understand

549
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,770
that z2 we have to live with the state

550
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:42,080
of the art of the protection I'm not

551
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:46,129
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today is covering</font>

552
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,800
everything now in the future and

553
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,660
depending on the nature of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> horrific</font>

554
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we'll put some more more and more</font>

555
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,190
sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> model behind this we will</font>

556
00:30:53,330 --> 00:31:00,439
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that popular level of</font>

557
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:02,540
information is processed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

558
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the last question about the</font>

559
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,629
comparison mm-hmm so from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my experience</font>

560
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,520
it's very difficult to definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

561
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:14,390
identify between the versions which

562
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,879
parts were have been changed yes or have

563
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,890
been not so for instance if you know

564
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this tool is in the presentation</font>

565
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,470
and regard so basically in the under

566
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:27,200
guard you have this specific

567
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,900
functionality to compare to two versions

568
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,180
of applications and find out what is the

569
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,040
difference yes but it deals only<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

570
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,560
representation of different

571
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,139
functionality making it as a string and

572
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,800
then comparison yeah so do you use the

573
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:45,440
same approach here I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one is</font>

574
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">still in the pipeline</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

575
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:54,170
would like what we are about to code is

576
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:56,990
a comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we use a shape or the</font>

577
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:00,440
open on the graphical view okay and we

578
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:03,530
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to to look if this shape of</font>

579
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,630
a red and white is still the same from

580
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">one version to the other and say okay</font>

581
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,330
this won't look the same or this one is

582
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,040
different and to help the user to

583
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,970
highlight where the differences will be

584
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you're not talking about the</font>

585
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:22,850
representation I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how you</font>

586
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:24,530
will identify these differences so it's

587
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,770
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify differences</font>

588
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:30,680
what has been changed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code yes so</font>

589
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,970
just I was asking curious about what

590
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,610
method do you use

591
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,950
to see the differences may most probably

592
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,679
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you mentioned this and regard to</font>

593
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:43,370
until you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

594
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure i have to i would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

595
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,179
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the team will do here for</font>

596
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:52,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the specific path so I don't want to</font>

597
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:55,130
come with the wrong answer but so yeah I

598
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:57,830
prefer to not give you a wrong wrong I'm

599
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,930
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I wouldn't always here to my</font>

600
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,480
technique or Easter oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I will</font>

601
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:09,230
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safely two containers</font>

602
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:11,870
OMG i so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a question you said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

603
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:14,360
I mean you're too pretty much relies on

604
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:17,239
checking what kind of of<font color="#CCCCCC"> obfuscation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

605
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,550
us to determine how secure application

606
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,780
is so do you have any idea of what are

607
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,270
the most common kinds of obfuscation

608
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:26,090
that you see in the vacation that you

609
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,490
passed your tool what kind of sorry so

610
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,290
which which I mean there are different

611
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:34,040
kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> obfuscation mechanism so which</font>

612
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:37,190
ones are the most common ones among the

613
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:40,040
hundred applications so today as you

614
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:42,740
could see we are focusing mostly on the

615
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Java part ok so the native path is not</font>

616
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:48,230
yet available on the tool and on the

617
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java part i would say program is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

618
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:54,080
we have spotted the most it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it also</font>

619
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:58,040
into your question yes we can also take

620
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,330
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> offline thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks again for</font>

621
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:06,530
your presentation

622
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:06,530
