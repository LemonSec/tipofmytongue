1
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,960
much like you have said I've been

2
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,570
working at Broadway National Bank for 21

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:40,500
years I've done everything from Novell

4
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:44,140
to to Microsoft Active Directory

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,920
directory services everything from user

6
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,590
provisioning to VMware BCP certified

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,230
back in 2012 and now I'm my focus is

8
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,790
primarily on security but one of the

9
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,370
things I've always done for the bank is

10
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,149
I've taken care of the domain purchases

11
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:04,449
and the certificate purchases and that

12
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:06,970
type of security infrastructure and in

13
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,149
this day and age right now there's a lot

14
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:14,560
of talk especially in the Middle East

15
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:18,220
people taking over corporations and

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,810
governments by honing their DNS because

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,300
you can point it anywhere you want once

18
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,890
you own that DNS information or once you

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,110
get a hold of their domain registration

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,630
so I like to talk first a little bit as

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,679
a ad like you said community involvement

22
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,318
get out there and help others in need I

23
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,819
personally do elf Louise if you're not

24
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,619
from San Antonio Alpha Louise is a

25
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:43,539
charity that was started by a Trinity

26
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,530
University graduate that said you know

27
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,840
there's some kids out there they're not

28
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,289
getting presents for Christmas and so

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,880
what I ended up doing is it started 1960

30
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,830
whatever now they serve I can't remember

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,229
how many thousands of families here in

32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,720
town but I helped deliver gifts for them

33
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:02,590
and there's a picture coming up here of

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,090
me and Alf Louise yeah that's what I

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,649
look like with a full beard and there's

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,920
not a lot of white in that beer that

37
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:13,390
just the way it grows so mentoring get

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:15,730
out there and help somebody once again

39
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,410
find somebody to mentor mentor them one

40
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,690
on one no matter where you are in your

41
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:25,030
quest to do this journey of ite and/or

42
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:31,060
security you can definitely help someone

43
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:34,270
out whether it's going to oh yeah review

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,880
their resume a matter of fact I having

45
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,840
people review my resume because you

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,579
never know when you're gonna need

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
something like that actually auditors

48
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,519
would ask us for

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,900
resumes at the bank do we have to turn

50
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,459
in if you are mentoring somebody give

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,569
them some projects to work on something

52
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:51,950
that's going to be in their area or

53
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,280
their field that they're getting into

54
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:59,629
you little encouragement goes a long way

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,160
oh it there's an extra hit at the bottom

56
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:02,959
of that

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,150
CyberPatriot how many people here know

58
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,840
about CyberPatriot the high school teams

59
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,940
and stuff yes definitely Jeff so San

60
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,830
Antonio is blessed with over 300

61
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,959
CyberPatriot teams at junior high school

62
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,750
and high school levels these kids

63
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,090
actually do blue team work right blue

64
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,940
team is the defense of the network right

65
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,760
you go out and you patch the systems you

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,900
go ahead and you configure the users

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,459
correctly that some of might have

68
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,110
excessive writes others might need

69
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,879
rights to go do somethin it's the

70
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,970
applications might need to be secured

71
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,859
and this is on Linux and on Windows so

72
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,590
what you do is you try and help them

73
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,360
succeed and they need more mentors

74
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,180
because these teachers are not

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,880
technically competent when it comes to

76
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,069
the blue team effort that we end up

77
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,319
doing and literally if you can patch a

78
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,880
windows server then you can go ahead and

79
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,950
take care of this and help them out

80
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,269
because that's the basic stuff that they

81
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,760
need to know it's a lot of its just

82
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,180
vocabulary right so who can help

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,130
everybody it was really hard for me I

84
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,989
literally called up this high school

85
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,760
that's closest to my office and said

86
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,709
who's the person in charge of

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,959
CyberPatriot or your computers

88
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,900
they put me in touch with them they put

89
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,899
me in touch with their CyberPatriot team

90
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:23,570
and now I'm actually helping support two

91
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:25,340
teams so one of the things I found out

92
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,940
that they needed was access to the

93
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,609
Internet

94
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,120
good access to the Internet I said come

95
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,580
to the bank

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,729
we've got Wi-Fi here it's about a

97
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,530
hundred mega square so they worked out

98
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:42,950
of the bank and it worked really well

99
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:45,650
for them and once again security basics

100
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,659
I can't say this enough to people and I

101
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,840
still have a lot of this with I have to

102
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,289
talk about even in my office security

103
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,830
you're never done it did if I patched

104
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,150
everything

105
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,729
a hundred percent and I had nothing left

106
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,250
a patch today at the bank there's

107
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,560
tomorrow because tomorrow they're gonna

108
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,570
find something else that needs a patch

109
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,880
whether it's a server a router or switch

110
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,130
some kind of configuration that somebody

111
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,110
messed up eight years ago that's been

112
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,090
out there no one knew about it it takes

113
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,330
lots of people to secure these things

114
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:20,479
and guess what those people they need

115
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,669
training they really do and that's why I

116
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,820
come to these types of events it's not

117
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:30,680
just to take pictures the patching will

118
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,560
continue until security improves I'm

119
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,630
glad I kind of came up with that one and

120
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,550
it's true like I was saying you can

121
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:41,360
never be done when you're talking about

122
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,910
that type of stuff oh this is getting

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,800
more technical but there's like a system

124
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,680
that would that Microsoft makes that

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,150
patches systems SCCM if you look at the

126
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,760
patch manager report you know what it

127
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,400
says it says let's say 100% of the

128
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,890
things are patched 100% of the things

129
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,169
that can talk to you are patched that it

130
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:04,700
knows about but if it's got a client out

131
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:06,350
there that's broke and he patched so so

132
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,969
you need to have another way to validate

133
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,350
that it's patched so what you do is you

134
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,900
do vulnerability management you have

135
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,330
some independent system that's not part

136
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,830
of SCCM because SCCM will lie to you

137
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,530
because it doesn't know about all the

138
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,609
systems that you have out there so just

139
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:24,859
some basic stuff so if you how many

140
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,960
people here own a domain or have ever

141
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,360
done anything with the domain so you

142
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
went to GoDaddy or you went to hover or

143
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,830
you went to some company by the way my

144
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,530
big favorite right now is hover you get

145
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,430
a domain for like 14 dollars a year and

146
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,450
with privacy so it's a very very

147
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,930
cost-effective way to own a couple of

148
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,360
domains the next thing is you have a

149
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,760
domain registrar and then you have DNS a

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,560
lot of people just do DNS at the domain

151
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,200
registrar but some people have to do it

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,380
remotely or like we did at Broadway Bank

153
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,710
for more than a few decades or a decade

154
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,830
and a half

155
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,200
we did it DNS in-house for the internet

156
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,000
for our own stuff we took care of it

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,159
ourselves and the last thing is a

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,750
certificate authority used to be

159
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,370
Verisign was the big one but they

160
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,630
themselves in the foot they didn't

161
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,920
really shoot themselves in the foot they

162
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,750
actually put both feet on top of each

163
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,790
other and they lined up at one shot

164
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,180
where just one bullet they got both feet

165
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:22,580
and basically they are no more digits or

166
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,460
bought their stuff and their certs have

167
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,830
been basically deprecated across the

168
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,930
internet I can't even imagine cuz they

169
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,580
printed money how do you do that they

170
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,880
print money because they give you ones

171
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,520
and zeros for lots of cash and I don't

172
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,159
know nonetheless so those are the three

173
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,659
major pieces and so you need to make

174
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,850
sure you keep all of those three major

175
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,320
pieces secure because like Wayne hi lost

176
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,330
its online presence right

177
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,040
did you use password you reuse it's a

178
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,960
typical problem that you see out there

179
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,300
they use the same user ID and password

180
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,940
at some other place and then somebody

181
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,950
saw this in a breach that's a bad guy

182
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,400
god and he logged into their stuff and

183
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,110
when he did he owned them and that's

184
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,210
once again the domain registration

185
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,980
website email and you wanted to factor

186
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,229
authentication if it's just a username

187
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,169
and password it's definitely not

188
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:17,419
adequate in 2019 you have to have Google

189
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,330
Authenticator or some other type of

190
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,919
extra factor involved in your login to

191
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,690
all of the services that I'm talking

192
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,940
about once again your your domain

193
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,860
registration your DNS services and your

194
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,440
your certificate certificate authorities

195
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,940
of course once again if personally I

196
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,309
don't have to get into a certificate

197
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,650
authority I use let's encrypt because

198
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,390
it's free so I don't have to even worry

199
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,039
about that it's all any API on the

200
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,468
backend but if you're doing it at a

201
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,729
corporate level like I do at work it's

202
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:48,080
really important to make sure that that

203
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:50,420
stuff's really really tight review the

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,580
access logs of who's getting into those

205
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,810
systems as often as you can because

206
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,150
that's when you're gonna find out that

207
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,180
guess what if they would have been doing

208
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,510
that like there's a bank down in Brazil

209
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,699
that got owned and what they did is they

210
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,080
went in they logged in they could figure

211
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,690
out that they could change their DNS

212
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,320
information they got out and they didn't

213
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,630
do anything

214
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,570
three months later after they built a

215
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,640
duplicate of what the bank had they

216
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,530
flipped the switch and they got a bunch

217
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,300
of people logging in and the information

218
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,560
of their logins so they could start

219
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,680
moving their money around at the real

220
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,060
banking system

221
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,339
so but once again if they would have

222
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,079
reviewed that log information of who was

223
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,960
logging in and realized somebody did it

224
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,090
that shouldn't have or they had I don't

225
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,450
know two-factor authentication not a

226
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,430
text message nist deprecated text

227
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,770
messaging as a second factor what was

228
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:46,130
that two years ago at least two years

229
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,199
ago how did they pwned

230
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,350
the the guy that started twitter jack

231
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,800
dorsey they took over his SMS text they

232
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:57,260
cloned his phone and it's just it's too

233
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,209
easy to do that is such a thing you

234
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,800
should never do anymore

235
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,110
a matter of fact if your bank is doing

236
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,279
that as a second factor please beg your

237
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,040
bank to do something else

238
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:13,010
Google Authenticator Yubikey physical

239
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:15,560
key for a token once again to factor

240
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,510
everything those that don't know what a

241
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,369
UB key is this is the Yubikey it just

242
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,529
looks like a little USB key it's got a

243
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,270
gold disk on it they're not cheap

244
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,939
they're like fifty bucks for this one

245
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,829
but you get two of these guys and I

246
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,440
login and I tell Google this is what I

247
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,000
am this is this is my physical token and

248
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,830
you have you I could leave it plugged

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,420
into the computer it doesn't do it thing

250
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,339
because I haven't figured out how the

251
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,900
hacker can go and touch this little gold

252
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:44,330
disc for motely so unless they can

253
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,890
figure out how to do that I could leave

254
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,450
it in the computer I'm still good I

255
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,330
don't leave it in the computer because

256
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,370
that's just bad practice but you could

257
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,960
because they have to touch the thing to

258
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,540
make it actually give you the random

259
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,790
number you're all familiar with these

260
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,459
things because they're really it's the

261
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,130
way to go they makes some lesser devices

262
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,560
than a Yubikey but they have more

263
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,270
limited functionality and I don't want

264
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,739
to be limited but they do have a couple

265
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,300
of other companies that make these for

266
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,190
like twenty bucks that are pretty

267
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,170
adequate at least they're better than

268
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:20,450
your SMS text message and who takes them

269
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,550
Google Twitter Facebook they're all

270
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,930
capable of using a Yubikey as a second

271
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,300
factor Oh

272
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,420
LastPass once again password managers

273
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,099
right once again logged me at log

274
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,449
changes monitor the logs so I grew up in

275
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,520
the 1970s

276
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,490
and high technology for a kid in the 70s

277
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,120
is the phone system right that was my

278
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,760
thing and so how would you look up a

279
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,380
phone number in the 1970s you grab the

280
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,600
phone book they published those things

281
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,150
every year right here in San Antonio am

282
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,590
I in it and so you'd have to go to the

283
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,660
right page and you look it up and you

284
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:00,770
take a name and you put it into a number

285
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,030
right next if you call the number often

286
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,790
enough you might write it down near the

287
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,040
phone finally you're gonna do it so

288
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,439
often you're gonna remember it you free

289
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,300
it to be able to recall it quickly

290
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,070
that's like a DNS lookup when you look

291
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,319
something up in the phone book that's

292
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,450
like you're going to the phone book to

293
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:22,250
figure out where does Broadway dot bank

294
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:25,970
resolve to a number finally or I'm sorry

295
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,230
next if you write it down let's say it's

296
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,660
something that you put in your hosts

297
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,160
file which is a specific file on whether

298
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,350
it's a Linux computer or a Windows

299
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,579
computer is a file called host if you

300
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,140
put the IP address space and the name

301
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,960
yeah I got that backwards the name the

302
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,400
space and the IP address it will go in

303
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,730
every time you're looking for that name

304
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,959
it'll go there at first that's like

305
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,060
writing it down there the phone book

306
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,650
finally if you use it it's going to be

307
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,449
like cached in your memory of your

308
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,300
computer or it's gonna be cached in the

309
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,710
DNS server nearby and then you'll be

310
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,089
able to get it quicker because it

311
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,120
doesn't have to go through the hosts

312
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:06,860
lookup or the lookup to the phone book

313
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,530
or DNS itself what's the first phone

314
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,770
number y'all learned I'm just curious

315
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,660
anybody with 911 one that's cool so

316
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,000
you're younger right a lot of people say

317
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,370
their house right but I didn't know my

318
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,670
house phone number the number I knew was

319
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,560
two six six I'm sorry two two three guys

320
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,099
one more time two two six three two

321
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,199
three two Frost Bank time and temp right

322
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,760
I work at Broadway but as a little kid

323
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,800
I'd call Frost Bank time and tap because

324
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,930
they talk to me right they'd be like hey

325
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:42,469
time and temp is this and you know

326
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:44,900
please Bank it Frost Bank so

327
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,550
the Internet is governed by a bunch of

328
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,660
documents the documents are called

329
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,459
request for comment rfcs so everything

330
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,370
that's done whether it's CCP IP or

331
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,690
whatever is has an RFC behind it and if

332
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,670
you really want to get into the

333
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,040
nitty-gritty of how things work you

334
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,689
start reading these RFC's and you really

335
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,599
can get a good handle on it

336
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:13,400
DNS is governed by some really old RFC's

337
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:17,030
from 1987 so what makes DNS quick and in

338
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:22,090
the simple answer is UDP protocol UDP

339
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:24,620
protocol is connectionless I took it off

340
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,060
there's a vendor around the corner

341
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,870
that's giving away these blinky badges

342
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,089
it says tcp/ip or tcp/ip you know and

343
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,360
it's got the header information if you

344
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:39,740
take about 70% of that away that's a UDP

345
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:43,130
packet they're very fast they don't care

346
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,840
about if service I don't care about all

347
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,550
this other stuff they just want to get

348
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,740
that packet out there so they're really

349
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,380
good for things like audio or video

350
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,000
things that are fast one way if you drop

351
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,740
a few packet it's not going to matter

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,240
you might get a little bit of jitter in

353
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,770
the in the video or you hear a little

354
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,710
jitter in the phone call but it's not

355
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,810
going to kill it right so but the deal

356
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,580
is it's you're just throwing it out

357
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,719
there and the first person that answers

358
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:14,350
your packet wins and UDP so if that

359
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,050
first person is a bad guy running a

360
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:22,250
Wi-Fi pineapple then you might get the

361
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,729
wrong information in your DNS what makes

362
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:28,450
it secure not much once again it's

363
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:32,180
easily intercept DNS is easily fooled

364
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:35,120
and it's it's just easily manipulated by

365
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:40,189
bad people as well as just misconfigured

366
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,320
as well so once again spoofing poisoning

367
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,960
poisonings where I just answer faster

368
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,380
and I give you the wrong answer and you

369
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,480
can be used for DDoS attacks let's go

370
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,120
through the DNS process let's say user

371
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,580
types in USA brute CyberPatriot org into

372
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
their favorite browser links probably

373
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,790
not you know

374
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,740
know what links is do you before there

375
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:05,510
was like web browsers that had images it

376
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:07,970
was a text-based browser yes text so you

377
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,339
click that up in the history you had a

378
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,310
links browser I'm sure Jeff absolutely I

379
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:18,020
did too yeah back when I had a shell

380
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,939
account so first thing it's gonna do

381
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,350
when you put in us CyberPatriot orga

382
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,200
it's gonna go is this resolvable in the

383
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,399
host file okay no it's not next thing

384
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,170
it's gonna do it's gonna look in the

385
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,750
local cache is it in memory on the

386
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,339
computer if it is then it's gonna

387
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,860
retrieve it there and go ahead and go

388
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:35,180
there it's looking for that IP address

389
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,430
finally it's going to ask DNS if

390
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,930
whatever your DNS information is set up

391
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,260
in your computer it's going to ask those

392
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,949
IP addresses the resolver is going to

393
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:48,350
send a recursive query to the DNS server

394
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,820
DNS server checks its cache to see if

395
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:54,620
it's something that somebody's asked for

396
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,510
recently then your DNS server if it's

397
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,100
not in cache it's gonna go and ask for

398
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,740
help so what's it gonna do it's gonna

399
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,250
make it an iterative query to the root

400
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,900
servers so these these I think 12 now 12

401
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,809
servers at the top of the food chain

402
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:13,730
that that that are the root DNS servers

403
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:15,949
for let's say dot-com or in this case

404
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,890
org so it's gonna go find the service

405
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:20,240
for org and it's gonna ask those hey I'm

406
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,640
looking for the IP address for us

407
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,079
CyberPatriot org so that's going to make

408
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,240
it a iterative query to the

409
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,740
authoritative nameserver us CyberPatriot

410
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,429
dot org so that's like going to the bank

411
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,660
and asking hey I want a dub dub dub okay

412
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,460
that's going to go ahead and respond

413
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,250
back with the IP address and the DNS

414
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,290
server updates at cache its cache so now

415
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,179
it's in memory then it's going to send

416
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,010
it to your computer computer is going to

417
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,780
pull ahead and update its cache and

418
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,020
provide a proper IP address to your

419
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,879
browser now you can go ahead and get on

420
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,260
US Cyber Patriot org and sign up

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,020
hopefully become a mentor now that you

422
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,360
understand kind of quickly how DNS works

423
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,250
how it goes and looks up the IP address

424
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,800
locally looks at in the host file looks

425
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,720
at it and DNS DNS goes up and grabs it

426
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,010
if the root servers which goes back down

427
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,280
to the individual server

428
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,590
the kins VAT the IP address that happens

429
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:21,320
so fast and once again it's UDP it's

430
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:22,909
really impressive DNS SEC when people

431
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,070
think of this at first especially at my

432
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,980
bank they were thinking oh it's like DNS

433
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,080
and security and I'm like yeah but it's

434
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:35,210
not a panacea it there are some

435
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,620
drawbacks to it so let's start doing DNS

436
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,720
SEC now matter of fact the country of

437
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,219
Sweden is pretty much that's all they do

438
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,490
they don't even do anything less than

439
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,160
that so it's TCP and not UDP that means

440
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,220
we have to do the TCP three-way

441
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,200
handshake right so I got a establish

442
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,970
connection with that server the server's

443
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,190
got a tech to me I got to say we're good

444
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:58,010
everything's fine now we can pass data

445
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,590
between us so that makes it a little

446
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,450
more a little slower but once again

447
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,250
considering the high speed internet that

448
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:11,390
we have today that's not that much of a

449
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:14,090
burden oh this one's just pains me some

450
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:17,060
domain registrar's have poor and or

451
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:19,399
really stupid support for DNS set and

452
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,399
this is where I'd like to name names yes

453
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,620
network solutions I'm talking to you to

454
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,170
put DNS SEC information in my domain

455
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,620
registrar at network solutions for my

456
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:32,180
bank I have to send them an email

457
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,739
they don't have an interface that I

458
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,050
could put that number directly into the

459
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,980
system I literally have to send it an

460
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,770
email which goes to a queue which some

461
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:46,520
person finally gets around to doing only

462
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:49,790
from 8:00 to 5:00 Eastern Time during

463
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,160
the week and it is just insane it's

464
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,050
absolutely insane you don't have to do

465
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,460
that if I go to hover I don't have to do

466
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,040
there's a form to fill out I could just

467
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,500
put the number in it's there but these

468
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,860
guys in network solutions now owned by

469
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,870
web.com are complete morons they had

470
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,490
this problem four years ago I complained

471
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,590
about it when I first started doing it

472
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,980
they have that problem today because I

473
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:15,409
just did it last month oh you have no

474
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,910
idea the frustration because sitting

475
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,100
around and twiddling my thumb's and

476
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,370
waiting for them and sometimes they they

477
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,449
don't respond back with an email days

478
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,268
did it they put it in too

479
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,970
not I'll check it it's a mess it is just

480
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:30,679
a mess so they're about ready

481
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,600
matter of fact probably next month I'm

482
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,340
gonna do my darndest to make sure they

483
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,959
lose the business as a Broadway Bank and

484
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,970
by the way they were the only domain

485
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,370
registrar available in 98 when we put

486
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,169
these things in ninety it so that's how

487
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,209
long we've been using them they've lost

488
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:49,220
us as a customer because they cannot

489
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:51,500
keep up with technology that's sad so

490
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,510
proper sandy can be difficulty Dias when

491
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,159
done by hand and once again this man

492
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,769
Jeff rich is the only person I've ever

493
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:01,570
met in the entire planet that is self

494
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:04,760
signed or hand signed a DNS SEC record

495
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:07,070
normally you just office load that to

496
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,120
somebody that does it for a living

497
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,070
GoDaddy dine Verisign not Verisign there

498
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,000
are signs out of the DNS business as of

499
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:19,370
this past month Ultra DNS is another

500
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,649
company that you could use it used to be

501
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,699
I would be leery of telling what company

502
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:27,229
the Broadway Bank uses for DNS but

503
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,909
either you can easily find that out by

504
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,970
looking at our who is records because it

505
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:33,409
says ultra DNS all over it or you don't

506
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,549
know how to find out what a you is

507
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:36,700
record is and then I don't have to

508
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:40,908
really worry about you hacking me at all

509
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,320
because that's pretty basic stuff get

510
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:45,350
your domain registrar on board

511
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,980
or better yet like I'm gonna do go get

512
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:52,219
another domain registrar you need the

513
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,289
delegation of signing delegation and if

514
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,100
something you get that right of signing

515
00:21:54,289 --> 00:22:01,610
record and you get that from the servers

516
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,789
the DNS servers that you're going to be

517
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,918
hosted on so when I was at Verisign

518
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:10,940
their server gave me a particular set of

519
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:13,220
hash of what that key is when I moved to

520
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,450
ultra DNS that has changed because it's

521
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,169
on a different server they have a

522
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,639
different signature that they're going

523
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:21,500
by a different key that they're going by

524
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:25,969
for those servers so I needed to get

525
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:28,100
that key from them so I get that key or

526
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,260
that hash information and I send it up

527
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,269
to my Whois information once again

528
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,549
through network solutions it's a stupid

529
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,980
process where I email it within circa

530
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:39,200
which is what we use for dot bank

531
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,780
I'm able to put that in a form and

532
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,160
upload it immediately and actually be

533
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,210
able to see my changes happen

534
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,550
immediately how you did it

535
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,590
you probably self signed it then it gave

536
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,629
you the key then you had to go put it up

537
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,370
there and you had to get all the numbers

538
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,700
right you did it by command line you're

539
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,699
insane

540
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,810
DNS SEC why do it at all all the answers

541
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,730
that our DNS sack are protected they're

542
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,690
digitally signed so if they're altered

543
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:14,870
in any way you'll know and your browsers

544
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,490
and the future will be able to look at

545
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,399
that and say that we're not going to

546
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,600
accept that or there's a special case

547
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,180
which I'll mention in a little while

548
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,760
which Wow I'll mention a little while

549
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:31,690
that you unless it's signed properly you

550
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,690
will not get an answer of on DNS it so

551
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,429
once again future resolvers are going to

552
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,010
look at DNS SEC closer so they can take

553
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:42,710
care of it at the router end not the

554
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,870
server end a top-level domain like I'll

555
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,090
talk about in a second so you get

556
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,709
integrity right those records are signed

557
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,720
you know they're not tampered with and

558
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,090
you know that they're valid so if you go

559
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,950
to Broadway Bank you're well assured

560
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,780
that you're gonna go to Broadway Bank

561
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,050
you're gonna go to wherever the DNS says

562
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:03,530
because it is signed to be adopt Bank

563
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:06,200
when we move there you had to have DNS

564
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,960
SEC that was not an option it wasn't

565
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,370
something you could turn off it was done

566
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,920
because the top-level domain for dot

567
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,780
Bank mandates it so it gives a little

568
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,000
bit extra assurance that if you're

569
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,100
someplace and you're asking for the bank

570
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,360
you're gonna get there I mean I'm trying

571
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,159
to plug my bank I'm really trying to

572
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,260
plug DNS because it's pretty cool the

573
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,630
way that that works because my dot coms

574
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,240
and my dot nets I cannot be that assured

575
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:32,780
that that's the case I can do DNS SEC

576
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:38,990
with them but it's not as sure as the

577
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:41,090
top-level domain bought into it once

578
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,610
again DNS data is not encrypted to the

579
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,530
end-user and this is getting a little

580
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,409
bit dated now and you could still get a

581
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,450
DNS daus attack depending on we used to

582
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,049
have our DNS at our bank it was down a

583
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,739
tiny

584
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:58,970
little 30 Meg pipe and to be able to

585
00:24:54,739 --> 00:25:01,820
DDoS us would have been so so easy but

586
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,190
nobody ever did thank you Lord while we

587
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,658
had it on Prem or would have been so

588
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,879
simple just to blow a bank off the

589
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,889
internet but thank God it never happened

590
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:11,480
now of course being externally hosted

591
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:13,969
and all these other you know DDoS

592
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,590
mitigation tools and everything it gets

593
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,730
it's a lot better posture than we are

594
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,428
then we're down there's tiny little

595
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:23,239
straw of a network that most people have

596
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:25,759
beginner than that at their house so

597
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:30,109
confidentially invalid availability

598
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:33,320
check out the work done oh that's right

599
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:34,639
some of these new resolvers so some of

600
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,889
the other talks that are been going on

601
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:39,129
here - did this wood this last couple of

602
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:44,840
days yesterday and today i'll talk about

603
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:48,139
dough which is DNS over HTTPS firefox

604
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,749
and chrome are both going that way where

605
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:54,168
they're going to do that by default very

606
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:56,899
soon in the future so that makes it

607
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:59,239
harder for your provider of your

608
00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:02,059
internet to watch where you go on the

609
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:05,809
internet every single time you asked for

610
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:07,580
a dns request or anything that you go to

611
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:10,158
on the internet your internet provider

612
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,859
is watching that traffic and making a

613
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,809
log of where you go so it can target you

614
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:17,259
for market and sell you as the

615
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:25,158
informations data store that you are

616
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:28,129
right yeah what's that yeah it's it's

617
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:31,450
pretty sick well no they're there if you

618
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:31,449
want to you can turn it on right now

619
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,710
yeah no they didn't no no they were

620
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:38,840
supposed to turn it on already but they

621
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,820
haven't turned it on but the tools are

622
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,019
in there you can go look up how to turn

623
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,090
on DNS over HTTP and there's actually

624
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:50,330
like I think six different things you

625
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:53,600
have to change inside the browser for

626
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,850
Firefox and I can't remember if you have

627
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,350
to get the beta of Chrome I'm not

628
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,480
familiar with that one but I have done

629
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,399
it in Firefox it's pretty nice and you

630
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,470
can actually most times they tell you to

631
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:04,399
put it in a mode that if you can't get

632
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,580
the deed

633
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,720
the the the information securely from

634
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:16,520
DNS over HTTP then failover to just

635
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:19,430
renormalize now you get it via HTTP or

636
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,050
you fail and I think that's option three

637
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:25,309
inside a Firefox versus option two oh

638
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,899
yeah every time you get an update you

639
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,250
have to go and check your numbers and

640
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,010
the problem is sometimes you get updates

641
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,390
and it's like the browser just updated

642
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,500
you don't know so you have to keep an

643
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:38,440
eye on those things DNS SEC just do it

644
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,150
right

645
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,890
top-level domains make a demands if

646
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:48,940
you're got insurance or about Bank you

647
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:52,130
have to do it I'm a bank the bank is

648
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,760
governed not governed but assessed by

649
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:58,040
auditors using the FFIEC cybersecurity

650
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,320
assessment tool so we have to keep up

651
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,820
with that information and then one of

652
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,040
the lines the whole thing gets started

653
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,350
with DNS SEC for us is one of the lines

654
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:10,909
in there it says do you do DNS SEC and

655
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:12,730
we're like no but we could and then we

656
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,670
ended up going to dot bank which

657
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,920
facilitated who you mandated it but so

658
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,929
that checked a good box off that a lot

659
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,059
of banks don't have and other financial

660
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,500
institutions in this town alone

661
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:27,290
matter break if you look Broadway Bank

662
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,860
probably not probably has the cleanest

663
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:33,470
DNS SEC information in of all the

664
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,928
financial institutions including USA I'm

665
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,540
very happy about that

666
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:40,370
my little bank it's because I'm so just

667
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,500
like detail-oriented I'm really want to

668
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:47,928
make sure that it's best it possibly can

669
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:51,559
be for our customers so this DNS SEC

670
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:53,809
thing it's security right sort of but

671
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,639
it's not a panacea you you do have some

672
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:57,350
trade-offs it's a little bit slower a

673
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,830
little bit more cumbersome it's a lot

674
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:02,209
more work on the departments in to do

675
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:06,860
but in the end you there are some

676
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:08,540
serious benefits out of it you can do

677
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,300
prouds or plug-ins to see if it's really

678
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,520
DNS SEC I've done that oh and this is my

679
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,990
favorite I like challenges you know it's

680
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,160
like hey can we do this yeah we can do

681
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,740
this you know so I

682
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,690
just dug into it and in epping it

683
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,210
doesn't matter you know you're gonna

684
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:27,450
find out if you do IT for very long

685
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,250
there are times that you you just have a

686
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,830
passion for something you want to go for

687
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,169
it and make that thing happen and I ran

688
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:38,070
what this is the ball and it kind of

689
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:40,470
challenge our champion did at my bank so

690
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:47,780
now that you do DNS heck there's another

691
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:51,809
thing you can do so I go to a website oh

692
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:55,530
yeah DNS but over TLS a records I go to

693
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:56,940
a website and I can have a TLS a record

694
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,330
in the TLS a record will have

695
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:04,530
information in Indian s it's like hey

696
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:07,860
you got a port a protocol and a URL and

697
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:10,428
then a hash of the public certificate so

698
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,320
what that does is it's pretty neat you

699
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:15,150
can go ahead and you know I could use

700
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,600
mine you know and that's kind of what it

701
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:23,429
looks like right I'm gonna do a quick

702
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:26,280
mod here so it said port 443 right and

703
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:29,400
it's going to us hyper patriot it's

704
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:34,580
using TCP protocol and it's got some TLS

705
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:44,970
a information on it here I'll do this

706
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:47,780
okay you know this so yeah I could be in

707
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,780
presenter mode right

708
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,750
yeah and so this is the hash of

709
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:57,000
CyberPatriot or what looks like one so

710
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,940
what can Dane do for you let's say

711
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,650
you're trying to get to example.com you

712
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,820
look up example.com we kind of kind of

713
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:07,290
talked about the DNS process and then

714
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,580
you go to the website because you have

715
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,970
its IP address now right

716
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:16,730
and then example.com comes back with TCP

717
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:19,380
on port 443 example.com and you get the

718
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,170
secure information so you know that

719
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,210
their certificate there and you get a

720
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,640
sha-256 of their public certificate then

721
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:31,080
you can ask for the TLS a record from

722
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,050
DNS SEC and say look hey the DNS SEC

723
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,699
information that's secured and you know

724
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,250
it's right because it's got a signature

725
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,680
on it match it is the certificate that I

726
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,780
got from the website well that's great

727
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,250
then I know I got the right website I

728
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,310
know that there's not somebody with a

729
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:50,220
Wi-Fi pineapple in there that's man in

730
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:51,840
the middling me and giving me a website

731
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,960
that they think it's my bank but it's

732
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,689
not my bank all right so having TLS a

733
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,870
records is a really good thing because

734
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,670
it goes on top of DNS X they're

735
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,129
digitally signed and they're just a

736
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,380
signature of what you got well they

737
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,440
match yeah so this is what happens if

738
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,090
they don't match a Wi-Fi pineapple as

739
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,350
you might know I haven't seen too many

740
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,610
around this particular security

741
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,610
conference but I have seen the medic

742
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,770
card security conferences they intercept

743
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:23,040
the information and then they can force

744
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,510
your computer to go to sites that you

745
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,879
would think would be the correct ones

746
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,870
but there actually might be spoofed they

747
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,610
might be trying to steal your

748
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,399
credentials or whatever else that

749
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,979
they're doing as research or whatever so

750
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,600
so is the DNS record you received real

751
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,160
or is it from some pineapple that's on

752
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,129
somebody's backpack or something walking

753
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,750
around here's a backpack look there's

754
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,180
only eight antennas hanging out of it I

755
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,550
wonder what they're doing this was at

756
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:49,380
b-sides a year and a half ago and

757
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,760
technically what the guy was doing was

758
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,280
really impressive he was actually

759
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,500
listening to satellites satellite

760
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,800
telephone communications and he was

761
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,190
decoding their SMS messages yeah that's

762
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,158
why you don't use SMS kids

763
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,869
so is the certificate authority

764
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,089
trustworthy a certificate authority gave

765
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:12,570
out a valid certificate for your domain

766
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:15,678
to a bad actor how do you know how can

767
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:18,418
you tell I mean it could be github

768
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,450
accidentally the root certificate got

769
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:24,119
issued to you a user of github they're

770
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:26,119
meant to do like Fred github.com and

771
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,439
they ended up giving away to github.com

772
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:30,809
and that's happened for Google as well

773
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,599
over the years so can you tell that the

774
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:35,129
certificate you've got is from the

775
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,408
website that you're expecting it from

776
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:39,330
once again the TLS a record will tell

777
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:41,909
you because if it doesn't match what you

778
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,218
have inside of DNS that the company or

779
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:46,049
the individual put up there and they

780
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:49,979
don't match and there's a mismatch then

781
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:51,989
you know that there's something wrong so

782
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:54,179
Dane requires DNS SEC it's pretty easy

783
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:56,129
you just go and get the PEM file and

784
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,839
which is that that signature and you put

785
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:59,399
in the proper numbers matter of fact

786
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,710
there's a checker for it here I'll show

787
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:03,299
it to you there it is that's how you get

788
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,789
it so you just punch in the right

789
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:07,499
numbers I think I'd do three zero one

790
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:09,839
because I use the full certificate and

791
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:12,119
then I paste the pin format in here and

792
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,599
then it spits out this thing where it

793
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,690
says 443 TCP oh yeah that's for the port

794
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,789
number and the TCP or UDP or whatever my

795
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,200
name and the punch out of that

796
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:24,210
information then you put that up in the

797
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,308
TLS a record inside of your DNS provider

798
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,559
and it gives you that extra once again

799
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:31,740
level of assurance test your TLS a

800
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,809
record because a bad TSL a TLS a record

801
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:35,759
is worse than having no record at all

802
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:40,289
because then you're saying that hey this

803
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,940
is bad all the time so you go test it at

804
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:46,349
Dane tools and there's browser plug-ins

805
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:48,299
available for that as well and so this

806
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:52,230
is what a valid TLS a record looks like

807
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:55,259
using that particular tool CIA records

808
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,429
this is a new relatively new record this

809
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,970
has only been around for about two years

810
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:03,480
I love this record this record has saved

811
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:05,399
me so much grief there's this thing

812
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,170
called shadow IT and believe it or not

813
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,119
they give credit cards to people at

814
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:11,579
their companies and they go and buy

815
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,580
things and they try and set them up and

816
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:15,960
and stuff and you might not know it

817
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,910
because you what are you you're just a

818
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,360
security guy NIT what would you need to

819
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:23,100
know well this kind of stuff happens and

820
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,710
this is a good thing to catch it

821
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,370
see let's say I see a a record is really

822
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,460
simple

823
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:32,640
it says who can provide certificates to

824
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:36,120
your organization and if I specify that

825
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,490
exactly in this CIA record if somebody

826
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,650
tries to go get a let's encrypt

827
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:44,009
certificate for my domain it will fail

828
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:47,070
or any other type of things let's say

829
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,870
they they hired up we've come up with a

830
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:52,800
new domain for a new function at our

831
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:54,930
bank or whatever company the person in

832
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,060
charge of its subcontracted out the

833
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,350
browser over the website and all this

834
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,170
other stuff to some company

835
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:04,470
I tell the company hey you need a

836
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,810
certificate for this domain you talked

837
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,580
to me

838
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,950
two weeks later hey man I'm trying to

839
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:17,880
set up a certain it's not working where

840
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:19,950
did you get a cert me so there's only

841
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,390
three fields a really simple issue issue

842
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:28,549
wild and io def as of 2017

843
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:33,000
all certificate authorities have to

844
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:35,580
accept and honor CAA records or they get

845
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,990
blown away by Google and in Firefox and

846
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:42,360
everybody else you don't want to tick

847
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:44,759
off those guys right so I found I had an

848
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,670
example of the record but basically like

849
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,720
mine says we only buy certificates from

850
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,210
digit sir that's it and we will buy

851
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,459
domain or issue or issue wild so it's

852
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:01,650
like let's say Broadway Bank you know

853
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:04,710
startup Broadway to Bank and if anybody

854
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:08,040
tries to create a certificate that at

855
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,050
any other place we get an email and that

856
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,240
IO def is the email address that they

857
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:16,380
send that information to and that's

858
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,470
really handy because it really with

859
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,290
shadow IT this stops a lot of that fat

860
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,000
from happening and because it's honored

861
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:27,120
if you're a certificate authority and

862
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,410
you violate that the browser's will stop

863
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,368
you

864
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:35,038
they'll pull you out of the ruthless

865
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:40,980
system so now I have a painful DNS SEC

866
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:43,829
part so we're not Bank right and before

867
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:50,190
I go to questions dot bang top-level

868
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:53,099
domain is mandates your DNS SEC always

869
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,839
be on I did not know until three weeks

870
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:57,299
ago what I'm going to tell you which

871
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,460
there's two types of DNS SEC I've been

872
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:04,500
using it for four years but there's two

873
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:06,059
types there's insect opt-out that's the

874
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,069
typical one that's the one you get with

875
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:13,559
dot-com net whatever dot org insect

876
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:16,799
opt-out what that means is you can have

877
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,869
it on you can have it off you can do DNS

878
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,910
SEC or you should not do DNS SEC and

879
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:24,510
what will happen is you'll always get an

880
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:26,578
answer and so if you take your domain

881
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,520
your your DS keys out of your domain

882
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,670
provider and you don't have them there

883
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,200
that means you're turning in a sec off

884
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:36,210
you could still go to your websites you

885
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,450
can still get your MX record you can

886
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:41,279
still do all this other stuff three

887
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,950
weeks ago on Friday night

888
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:46,200
literally three weeks ago tonight at

889
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:49,078
about midnight I'm working on the system

890
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,808
because I'm moving DNS providers for my

891
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,000
bat bank the night before I did my dot

892
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,890
coms and not Nets got rid of those keys

893
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,690
started moving the stuff over to the new

894
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:03,299
domain DNS provider no problem top bang

895
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,279
midnight Friday night I go in there and

896
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:09,299
I take the BS keys out of the system

897
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:11,849
and go to bed get up about three or four

898
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:14,579
hours later whatever I look at my phone

899
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,579
and it says I can't deliver email

900
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:21,660
because you don't have an MX record I

901
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:24,059
was pale and instantly woke up oh my god

902
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,690
why can't you - my MX record why can't

903
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:29,460
it look up anything at Broadway Bank

904
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,559
because I blew the bank off the internet

905
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:36,900
basically when I got rid of those keys

906
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:41,080
it uses insect no opted-out insect three

907
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:43,780
in sec number three - no opt-out

908
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:48,580
that's mandated by the top-level domain

909
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,000
you can't turn off for a dot bank DNS

910
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,069
ech

911
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,960
if you take those keys out or there's

912
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,270
not keys that are valid in they're going

913
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,700
to valid servers to valid records you're

914
00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:04,540
not on the internet I dodged my bank bad

915
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:06,819
so panic calling up my DNS provider

916
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,950
trying to figure out what I did I didn't

917
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,000
really equate it to the taking the keys

918
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,129
out because I did it the night before

919
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,760
for the dot-coms and.net I'm thinking

920
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,860
I'm golden right no that's exactly what

921
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,790
happened now that I realized that what I

922
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:23,740
did now I got to put the keys back in

923
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:26,230
panic ensues even more for me because

924
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,629
every time you put the keys in the form

925
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,250
by the way thank God this wasn't Network

926
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,960
Solutions because I'd have to email them

927
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,080
on Monday and the bank would be out for

928
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,150
the whole weekend but it's in circa and

929
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,470
I have a form I could fill out right so

930
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,600
I go to the forum and I got to fill it

931
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,160
out in every single time you take a

932
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,720
change you have to put your second

933
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,759
factor in which is a rolling code of

934
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,870
force and not Google Authenticator but

935
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,220
it's just about as good you know it's

936
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:52,299
another rolling code type system and so

937
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,149
okay I made all the changes I get the

938
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,040
form filled out and okay I my numbers

939
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,660
getting ready to read okay I get the new

940
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,160
number I type in the number real quick

941
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:04,690
boom inner fail what happened and this

942
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,250
went on for like fifteen or twenty

943
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,930
minutes I tried it over and over and

944
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,120
over and I'm talking to support of my

945
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,620
DNS provider but not in circa on the

946
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,549
phone I can't even get in circa on the

947
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,040
phone until Monday

948
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,320
once again this is really in the morning

949
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,850
on Saturday morning

950
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,250
finally I'm talking to the guy and I

951
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:24,310
noticed I get to the end of the time of

952
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:27,910
the token and I hit enter it took it

953
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:30,400
their clocks are off the clocks are off

954
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:33,370
that whatever server is supposed to take

955
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,830
that second factor it was wrong now I

956
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:38,290
know what the problem is I wait till the

957
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:39,819
end of the deal and I hit enter and make

958
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:42,130
the next change that I need to make and

959
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:45,220
then finally get the third key and stuff

960
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:47,530
in there and we start the guy on the

961
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,870
phone with me we're starting to do what

962
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:52,000
a dig to see if those records show up

963
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,930
and they start showing up and Whois

964
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,270
information start showing up properly

965
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:59,600
and we're like thank God the bank's

966
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,400
gonna be ok again and and things are

967
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,170
still broken because now I have to wait

968
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,960
for those records to propagate across

969
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,210
the internet so he's got a tool where he

970
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,430
can go in and query all these DNS

971
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,710
servers all over the world and it starts

972
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:16,339
asking so it's filling in that cache

973
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:18,890
information right of the new records so

974
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,390
that's really started making things

975
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,629
alive so it's finding it's about 8

976
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,980
o'clock in the morning and I'm who is

977
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,050
literally this is like a resume

978
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:30,200
generating event to take a bank down for

979
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:33,170
a whole weekend yeah I was really

980
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,669
worried and got it all back up and

981
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,160
running and then I did the right thing

982
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,800
right at 9:30 I started typing in an

983
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:43,580
email that was relatively long and very

984
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:46,250
detailed of don't ever do this don't

985
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,980
don't do this thing if you do this thing

986
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:51,170
you will dodge the bank you know and

987
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,760
stuff and that's the reason I mean you

988
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,380
have to have security around things you

989
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,730
have to have to factor around things you

990
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,840
have to have good clocks over at the

991
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,740
other provider and all these things

992
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,200
because you really want to try and

993
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,060
provide the most secure way that people

994
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,399
can get to their their stuff does

995
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,390
anybody have any questions about DNS or

996
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,140
anything I know I kind of went through

997
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:17,779
it kind of quick but it's really it's a

998
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:19,700
it's a great set of tools way to keep

999
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,880
things up running and secure for your

1000
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:27,350
company like I said there's a there's

1001
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:31,520
something called DNS vis DNS viz I think

1002
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:33,470
net that's a tool you can go to look at

1003
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,780
someone's DNS SEC information and it's

1004
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,790
very visual it shows here's your let's

1005
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,700
say dot bank top-level domain and here's

1006
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,890
the the the next one down where you pass

1007
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,290
off the primary key to the secondary key

1008
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,089
then finally it's Broadway dot bank and

1009
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,240
you can see all the arrows connected to

1010
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:52,610
all the different records and stuff and

1011
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:56,450
it also gives you errors and stuff on

1012
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,800
the side of anything you got wrong oh I

1013
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:01,430
got a ten minutes left okay

1014
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,490
the the last thing is a key role is I'd

1015
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,169
like to mention just briefly most of the

1016
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,399
keys that are out there that are DNS SEC

1017
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,319
are shot to

1018
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,569
that's being deprecated and everything's

1019
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:12,619
moving to elliptical curve encryption

1020
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:16,788
for the keys

1021
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:18,650
so inside the key has the encryption

1022
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:20,809
which by the way shot to is considered

1023
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,329
the number eight I don't know why they

1024
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:27,920
just picked eight and the new one is 13

1025
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:33,680
so I'm rolling my keys right now to the

1026
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:36,260
new ECC elliptical curve certificates to

1027
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,680
do that once again I can't turn it off

1028
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,270
so I have to generate the new keys get

1029
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,049
the new keys put the new keys in the

1030
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:48,099
domain registration leave all the old

1031
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:50,990
keys and the new keys there for 48 hours

1032
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:52,849
everything propagates then I can go and

1033
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,250
delete the old keys then I have to

1034
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:58,819
delete the old keys out of DNS so

1035
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:01,130
there's it's like a 13 step process to

1036
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,000
do that but you know it's one of the

1037
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,950
things you got to do if you were going

1038
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,859
to maintain a high degree of security

1039
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,118
for your DNS and DNS records once again

1040
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:11,589
does anybody have any questions or

1041
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,589
anything about yes ma'am

1042
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:26,790
okay for common threat for church for

1043
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:28,950
against DNS SEC well probably the most

1044
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,290
common to be a DDoS attack depending on

1045
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:34,649
where your DNS servers are if you're

1046
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:37,680
having a really large company like dine

1047
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:42,390
or like us at Ultra or Verisign prior

1048
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,779
it's much better there because the we're

1049
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,830
not even in there background noise

1050
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,869
compared to the larger companies that

1051
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,869
are getting ddosed on a regular basis

1052
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:53,190
that hit their systems so that's

1053
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:54,750
probably the denial of service is

1054
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,090
probably the biggest thing that's what

1055
00:45:54,750 --> 00:46:01,140
happened when there was the big East

1056
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:02,940
Coast denial of service that happened a

1057
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,330
few years ago because they attacked dine

1058
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:08,790
they took out all the DNS and from

1059
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:11,279
record lookups for the East Coast that

1060
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:14,430
used that particular provider which was

1061
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,160
quite a bit but thank god they're

1062
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:19,980
mitigating that the best they can and

1063
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,750
once again these Middle Eastern groups

1064
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,910
and other groups that are attacking

1065
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,950
different DNS if you don't have to

1066
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:29,220
factor on your domain registration your

1067
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,990
your DNS your certificate authority then

1068
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:34,169
you're not gonna be able to do it oh and

1069
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:36,930
my CAA record says like like digit cert

1070
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,369
at digit cert I have multiple factors of

1071
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,740
authentication and I have to

1072
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:43,080
re-authenticate the ability to get the

1073
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,680
certificates on a regular basis to them

1074
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:49,290
that I am Who I am for the bank because

1075
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,600
once again it's not just that digit cert

1076
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,730
is my provider his digit cert knows that

1077
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,069
there's a small group of people that

1078
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,830
have the authorization and rights to get

1079
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,390
those certs because once again if you

1080
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:04,859
have the certificate for Broadway that

1081
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:07,490
Bank you on the bank basically so

1082
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:07,490
anything else

1083
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:23,420
now that that that is a that is just a

1084
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:25,220
straight-up attack on the host file

1085
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,500
because literally if you get once again

1086
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,879
like you're poisoning DNS that would be

1087
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,500
if you're capturing that data and you're

1088
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,200
answering first before their actual

1089
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:36,770
people are supposed to answer when

1090
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,270
you're attacking like putting filling in

1091
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,910
data into the host file like Oh

1092
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:42,619
Facebook's not over there it's over here

1093
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,359
but once again Facebook's going to want

1094
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:46,190
to have that certificate for Facebook

1095
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:47,779
that you end up going to you or they

1096
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:49,490
through port 80 and then you start

1097
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:53,930
seeing things in your browser that it's

1098
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:55,279
not certificates or secure the other

1099
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,250
thing of course is if you are running

1100
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,680
HTTP on your website every single

1101
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,720
element on that page must be HTTPS if

1102
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,730
you have one element or one thing in one

1103
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,359
script it connects to something that's

1104
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:10,609
HTTP no more lock no more happiness no

1105
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:12,619
more green bar no more whatever you're

1106
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:15,560
gonna get the I in the circle on your

1107
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:17,510
browser if it's chrome how do I know

1108
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:21,400
that yeah I got a marketing department

1109
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,400
baby oh yeah

1110
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:44,550
Starbucks well I mean a good way put it

1111
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:47,340
Starbucks public Wi-Fi any of that kind

1112
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:50,610
of thing where that's the most common

1113
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:52,530
place to do DNS poisoning a form of DNS

1114
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:54,510
poisoning happens sometimes by your ISP

1115
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,130
because they want you to see ads from a

1116
00:48:54,510 --> 00:49:00,330
certain place and they'll inject ads in

1117
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:02,370
the system so they'll like even though

1118
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,950
the web page doesn't have ads on it they

1119
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,960
can push an ad with the stream of data

1120
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:09,509
that comes back that's not DNS poisoning

1121
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,260
that's just mean cuz I pay them for that

1122
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:15,480
service so you know it's it's really

1123
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,700
it's you know I don't know what we're

1124
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,530
gonna do about ISPs but but so DNS

1125
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,960
poisoning for the most part it's the

1126
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:24,890
first person that answers the query wins

1127
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,930
and if it's a bad guy that's bad that's

1128
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:31,200
primarily once again with UDP but if

1129
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:33,149
you're doing DNS over HTTPS and you're

1130
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,040
doing it where it only lets that DNS

1131
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,110
over HTTP that means you're going to get

1132
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,730
it from whoever your provider is and
