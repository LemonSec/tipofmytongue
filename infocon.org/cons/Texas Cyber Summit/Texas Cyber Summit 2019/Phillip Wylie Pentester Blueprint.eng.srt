1
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,960
okay

2
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,559
give it just a little bit longer because

3
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,489
we had some people that registered

4
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,440
yesterday they weren't able to make it

5
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:13,010
and so make sure we give a little bit of

6
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,009
time so we got to this room until 12:15

7
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:28,470
what's that it's not working can you

8
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:33,710
hear the mic okay maybe it's just not uh

9
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:39,950
I mean test mic up a little bit listen

10
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:42,839
how's that test test

11
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,490
yeah I just have to speak speak up

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,040
hopefully the mic catches it because

13
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,039
it's about a closer if I can get it

14
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,399
maybe it is something with the speakers

15
00:01:51,750 --> 00:02:01,140
because you're able to you're getting

16
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:05,929
the sound and test test test test test

17
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,929

18
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,720
okay that's good thanks yeah I can hear

19
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,869

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,869

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,440

everyone a chance to get in

27
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,550
okay we'll get started thanks everyone

28
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,720
for attending my talk and hope you're

29
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,720
all having a good time so far you

30
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,010
enjoying the conference let's go yeah

31
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,080
this is a really nice conference there's

32
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,940
not a lot of them at this level and

33
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
Texas so it's really good a lot of times

34
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,620
you have to go out to bigger conferences

35
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,870
it to get the quality they have here but

36
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,970
today I'm giving my presentation at

37
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,370
pentester blue I did become a tester

38
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,020
there's a lot of resources out there a

39
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,900
lot of books and classes that show you

40
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,130
about pen testing but really most you

41
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,650
don't really see information on how to

42
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,820
become a pen - I kind of prerequisite

43
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,070
knowledge you need to become a pen

44
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,099
tester so this this talk actually

45
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:39,510
evolved from my first day of class

46
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,440
lecture that I give each semester and

47
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,060
along the way it's evolved into a

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,650
conference talk I've added more material

49
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,110
because some of the places were I

50
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,989
presented this and the conference's they

51
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,190
weren't in a class signed up and kind of

52
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,820
starting on their path to learning that

53
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,130
so I added in information on how to be

54
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,020
educated as a pen tester kind of to do a

55
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,030
gap analysis of where you're at to

56
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,500
figure out what you need to to learn in

57
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,590
just some of the different details about

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,280
pen testing so so I hope you find this

59
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,979
helpful and Who am I I'm Philip Wylie I

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,049
have my CISSP OS CP which I'm the most

61
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,470
proud of of all my certs it was the

62
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,820
hardest one earned and the sands web

63
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,980
application pen testing certification

64
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,080
for those not familiar with the OS CP

65
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,210
you actually have to hack into five

66
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,240
servers to get credit to pass the exam

67
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,669
and document that so it's a 24 hour exam

68
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,380
so there's no stop it's continuous so

69
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,300
that's why I'm so proud of it I didn't

70
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,190
pass it the first time around but it was

71
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,900
it was probably the one course I've

72
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,710
learned the more the most out of any

73
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,620
courses I've taken and I'm a principal

74
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,169
pen tester at a undisclosed national

75
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,880
bank top ten national bank I'm adjunct

76
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,310
professor originally College I teach at

77
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,050
the backing and web application pen

78
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,030
testing which I just added this spring

79
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,380
the courses are available online if

80
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,729
you're interested in taking the courses

81
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,900
pretty inexpensive - the courses are for

82
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,410
continuing ed online it's like three

83
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,560
hundred dollars for the course

84
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:10,710
I'm a bug cried ambassador I was one of

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,480
the first ambassadors and I was got the

86
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,710
Ambassador the Year award this year is

87
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,330
the first time they gave that since they

88
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,919
just started the program I became a

89
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,330
bugcrowd ambassador to help some of my

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,310
other after efforts like teaching my

91
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,890
students throughout the class I tell my

92
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,420
students different ways to gain

93
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,360
experience as a pen tester and learn pen

94
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,760
testing and so I've told them to you

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,260
know to join bug bounties because

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,320
through bug bounty you can get actual

97
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:38,670
hands-on experience yes okay again I

98
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,240
don't know if you turn the mic up a

99
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,240
little bit more

100
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,239
okay can you hear me okay

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,310
okay

102
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,200
and so if that just kind of played into

103
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,710
some of my other things that I was doing

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,500
and through them I've given workshops

105
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,239
and things I'm about pen testing I'm the

106
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,250
founder of the palm school project which

107
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,650
is an in Dallas we stream our our

108
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,060
lectures our talks each month and

109
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,120
they're available on YouTube afterwards

110
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,460
they're recorded and that was a way to

111
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,320
educate people they couldn't get in to

112
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,650
class because you know trying to

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,610
register for college classes sometimes

114
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,960
sending your transcripts over

115
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,250
registering making sure you have

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,190
prerequisites and it could be things

117
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,140
outside of technology and so there was

118
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,000
block just prevented some people from

119
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,789
getting in and I wanted to wait for my

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,640
students to learn past class so they can

121
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,740
learn some technologies more advanced

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,469
than what the class was taught was

123
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,210
teaching and also through this it was a

124
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,980
way to introduce people to the the

125
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,150
cybersecurity community because a lot of

126
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,370
people that come in through palm school

127
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,840
aren't aware of all the other groups

128
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,850
because Dallas we're pretty lucky we

129
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,679
have a lot of different different meetup

130
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,470
groups we have Dallas hackers

131
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,780
Association a local DEFCON group a local

132
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,600
a wasp group or Texas cybersecurity

133
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,489
group but Issa two different Issa groups

134
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,610
in the Metroplex so we have a lot of

135
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,419
different resources out there meeting

136
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,790
available that a lot of people don't

137
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,320
know and so they find us on Meetup and

138
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,580
they join and they find out about these

139
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,240
other areas and get involved in the

140
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,159
community I've been an IT and InfoSec

141
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,169
for over 22 years most of my experience

142
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,750
has been in security I started out as a

143
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,219
sysadmin I share this because this is

144
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,500
important to know someone is wanting to

145
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,890
be a pen tester it kind of plays into

146
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,919
what you need to know to be a hacker not

147
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,510
the black or a pen tester and that six

148
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,338
plus years that's where I got my start

149
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,049
and it8 years

150
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,180
network security and application

151
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,099
security applications security is when I

152
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,719
found out about penetration testing from

153
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,570
using web application vulnerability

154
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,630
scanners so my next career goal is to be

155
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,850
a penetration tester and 2012 I got laid

156
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,010
off and I went to work for a company as

157
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,630
a consultant doing pen testing so that's

158
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,620
where I got my start and pen testing and

159
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,570
I've been doing that for five and a half

160
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,940
four seven half years the first five

161
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,600
years was consulting and this is the one

162
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,819
job out of all my career that I've never

163
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,500
thought about changing to something else

164
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,880
I mean I really like what I do I still

165
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,769
get a big thrill out of hacking into

166
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,600
something you get back into something

167
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:17,120
that Phil is much fun now as it was when

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,829
I first started and the first five years

169
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,300
of consulting was really a good

170
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:22,099
experience for me because I got a lot of

171
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,000
experience really quick working in a lot

172
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,769
of different environments

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,920
Sierra get the chance to work in

174
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,880
consulting I highly recommend it I

175
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,469
eventually got out of it due to the

176
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,519
travel I was traveling four or five

177
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,740
weeks straight and I share the slighty

178
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,750
semester because if you're doing pen

179
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,730
testing do you want to make sure you

180
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,680
always have permissions so hacking

181
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,300
without permission is illegal so you

182
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,420
know make sure that you have permission

183
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,300
to hack make sure you've got a you know

184
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,889
contract something in writing it's best

185
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,719
to go through a company to do pen

186
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:55,430
testing or do bug bounties that way

187
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,680
you're covered you may be helping

188
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,000
someone out to do doing them a favor and

189
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,579
it could end up being someone just want

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,050
you to hack someone else's website we

191
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,670
have people coming to Dallas hackers all

192
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,229
the time asking if they could hack

193
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,670
someone's phone or their Facebook page

194
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,740
and stuff like that so you want to make

195
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,209
sure that you're careful because if you

196
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,769
end up getting a felony on your record

197
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:15,739
it's kind of hard to get any kind of job

198
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:18,290
in IT or or security and so make sure

199
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,579
you have that that permission and also

200
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,360
like this quote I think it's a good

201
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,670
example of that

202
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,069
having the hacking skills with great

203
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,349
great power comes great responsibility

204
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,670
it's a Voltaire quote I found out when I

205
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,959
was looking up I want to get the quote

206
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,389
right I originally heard it in

207
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,849
spider-man so it was I like I'm a big

208
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:36,949
Marvel movie fan and so that's where I

209
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,480
got it from so I want to make sure the

210
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,479
quote was correct it's a now a little

211
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,319
more more refined since it's a you know

212
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:50,540
someone famous and not just the Stan Lee

213
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:52,370
think so and what is pentesting so to be

214
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,649
a pen tester you understand what pen

215
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,959
testing is it's assessing security from

216
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,790
an adversarial perspective from a

217
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,680
malicious actor a malicious hacker this

218
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,149
is that you're testing data from that

219
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,008
way you're trying to see if you can get

220
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,350
to sensitive data that may be on the

221
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:08,810
network a lot of people times people are

222
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,959
more concerned with root domain admin

223
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,880
when ultimately the prized possession

224
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,739
that needs to be protected is since the

225
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,780
data this case

226
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,100
customer customer data a credit card

227
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,300
number this could be you know HR data so

228
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,920
this is at the other day is what needs

229
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,870
to be protected so if you can get to it

230
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,640
without domain admin you're still

231
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,750
accomplishing that goal and so testing

232
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,560
this method you have a better

233
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,700
understanding of the security risks

234
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,010
exploitable vulnerabilities are a higher

235
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,570
risk and this is a way to justify

236
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,980
remediation because sometimes

237
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,730
remediation is as simple as applying a

238
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:51,660
patch or doing some kind of

239
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:55,000
configuration update adding some sort of

240
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,560
layer software some type of endpoint

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,900
protection but sometimes you can get

242
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,130
really expensive so if you by doing

243
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,230
these pin tests showing that this

244
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,230
vulnerability is exploitable then it's a

245
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,530
way to justify remediating the

246
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,750
vulnerability and a lot of times with

247
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,579
with doing that the penetration tests

248
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,350
some of the experience I've had in my

249
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,390
consulting days there's a lot of times

250
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,190
companies will internal employees will

251
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,480
find vulnerabilities and they've been

252
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,580
telling their management for years we

253
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,960
need to fix this and sometimes they

254
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,280
don't fix it sometimes they don't it's

255
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,080
either they don't trust them but they

256
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,880
just don't fix it and they're just kind

257
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,860
of blowing them off but a lot of times

258
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,080
if a third party comes in and proves its

259
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,540
vulnerable and shows the risk sometimes

260
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,760
it's easier to get those things were

261
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,290
mediated and one time I was on a pen

262
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,620
test for a large international law firm

263
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,910
and sisa was actually pointing out bonor

264
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,470
abilities hey check this check this

265
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,030
because it was something he wanted to

266
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,890
get fixed for years but the company

267
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,199
wouldn't you know give him the budget to

268
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,699
remediate it so he was actually pointing

269
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,560
us in the right direction so we had this

270
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,600
stuff in the report to give to their

271
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,010
management to hopefully get it

272
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
remediated get the budget to get it

273
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,689
remediated it's a fun job like I said

274
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,280
it's just I have just as much fun

275
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,050
hacking into something now as I did when

276
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,490
I started and there's a lot of job

277
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,930
opportunities when I was getting started

278
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,620
it was mainly consultants and

279
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:15,939
contractors but as PCI compliance became

280
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,560
more relevant and important PCI pen

281
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,190
tests are required to do pen tests for

282
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,140
PCI and so now companies happen to hire

283
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,090
their own internal resources you know

284
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,459
like our team we got about 15 people our

285
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,220
team Bank of America has an internal pen

286
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,029
test team Capital One State Farm a lot

287
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,889
of these companies have their own

288
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,079
internal pen testers because if you have

289
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,939
600 applications you have to test and

290
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,609
you're paying a consultant to do all

291
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:41,679
those that gets really expensive so and

292
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,749
it's good also to have internal pen

293
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,279
testers so that way you know going

294
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:47,470
through a consulting company you have to

295
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,119
get a statement of work and they get

296
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,189
their consultants are busy so trying to

297
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,420
time them get them there in a certain

298
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:54,248
time you need the tests done you may

299
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,628
need to do a simple retest and if you

300
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,259
have people on staff you can do it like

301
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,569
right away

302
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,740
and there's lots of opportunities just

303
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,160
from the fact that people are starting

304
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,439
to build their own internal pen testings

305
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,969
and pen testing jobs so if you're out

306
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:09,368
there looking at jobs it doesn't always

307
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,860
say penetration tester or ethical

308
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:14,230
hackers so some of the and you know the

309
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,149
more common term that we use in industry

310
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,679
as penetration testers or in pen testers

311
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,730
but when you start looking at the job

312
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,949
descriptions you're looking for a job

313
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,689
you look at the job descriptions look at

314
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:24,429
the tools and the duties the things that

315
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:26,920
you're doing in that because most these

316
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:29,230
job titles are like security consultants

317
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,240
analysts or engineers and a lot of this

318
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,999
is due to HR not wanting to create

319
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,699
thousands of job titles because you know

320
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,679
IT and security you know y times you

321
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:40,929
have like they limit it so there's that

322
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,059
it reduces the overhead and and easier

323
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:45,490
for them to manage so like where I'm at

324
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:47,170
I'm a principal information security

325
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,730
engineer and so they just have the

326
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,910
different titles and most of them are

327
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,249
based on job grade so like below that

328
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,868
would be like a senior cyber security

329
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,980
engineer so forth so when you're looking

330
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,929
for these jobs look through the

331
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,999
descriptions and another thing I like to

332
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,499
do with job descriptions is you find a

333
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,209
type of job you want to go into or you

334
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:06,279
want to get better at a certain skill I

335
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,479
like to go through look at the job

336
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,920
listings and look at some of the

337
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,839
requirements look at some of the tools

338
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,549
they're looking for so if you have been

339
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,439
doing just networked pentesting and you

340
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:15,189
want to do we're about pen testing start

341
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,420
looking at some of these job

342
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:18,160
descriptions and look at the tools

343
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,540
they're using so that kind of gives you

344
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,459
some tools that you can focus on

345
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,569
learning to help you in that area and

346
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,479
then it kind of gives you a good weight

347
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:27,279
if you're applying for that company if

348
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,809
you kind of tailor your resume to fit

349
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,129
the keywords they're using it's a better

350
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:34,929
chance that your resume may get selected

351
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:37,149
different terms synonymous with pen

352
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:38,679
testing as ethical hackers that's that's

353
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,759
the easiest to describe when you work in

354
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,630
industry or when you're trying to tell

355
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,980
people

356
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,320
your pen testers they think maybe you

357
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,850
work for BIC testing ink pens or if you

358
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,850
tell him penetration tester they kind of

359
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,950
look at you funny and another term

360
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,320
that's kind of been popular and kind of

361
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,690
created by are made popular by offensive

362
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,910
security the makers of Kali Linux and

363
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,740
the osep certification is offensive

364
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,930
security because you know your blue team

365
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,550
is your defense so this is another term

366
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,520
offensive security that's used in

367
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,680
adversarial security is another one it's

368
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,480
been that's a real popular term that has

369
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,370
become popular the last couple of years

370
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,010
threatened vulnerability management this

371
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,140
is usually the teams that departments

372
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:20,200
that pen testers fall under maybe your

373
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,819
remediation teams or your people to do

374
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,290
the reoccurring vulnerability scans and

375
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,360
pen testing skills in other areas

376
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:32,020
there's other areas that pen testing can

377
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,760
that is very popular - very good to have

378
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,540
these skills in so like if you're a sock

379
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,460
analyst be able to identify malicious

380
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,829
traffic is very important visual

381
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,020
forensics if your digital forensics or

382
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,670
instant response person be able to

383
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,069
identify those attacks you know what

384
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,630
you're gonna you're gonna have easier

385
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,830
time detecting certain things knowing

386
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,480
the type of attacks that you're familiar

387
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,590
with those kind of traffic's and the

388
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,380
footprints that they leave on your

389
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,550
systems Network analyst engineers this

390
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,870
is an area to understanding the

391
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,329
malicious traffic understanding how to

392
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,010
protect against it be able to talk to

393
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,990
management and say this what this needs

394
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,699
to be done for these reasons this needs

395
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,550
to be remediated because these types of

396
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,470
attacks do this or this type of risk and

397
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,270
then purple teams this kind of a new

398
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,490
concept it's where people go back and

399
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,109
forth doing both a lot of companies may

400
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,329
not have the staff to have everyone

401
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,060
siloed as pen testers or our blue

402
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,889
teamers and some companies people have

403
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,220
the opportunity to do both and they get

404
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,569
to do defend and attack and this may be

405
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,790
more interesting for some people in

406
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,560
applications security this is how I

407
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,930
found out about penetration testing so

408
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,149
you have to pen test applications and

409
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:40,990
just understanding applications security

410
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:43,630
to secure the applications and working

411
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,590
with developers to make sure that those

412
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,180
applications are secure when you perform

413
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,699
a pen test these are the type of targets

414
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,330
the type of items that you'll be testing

415
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,529
against one of the most common is now

416
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,428
work then application hardware

417
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,350
transportation people through social

418
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,480
engineering and buildings through

419
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,370
physical engine security and a lot of

420
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,370
times the the - the social engineering

421
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,250
and the physical security kind of go

422
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,418
hand in hand and the transportation

423
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,279
thing is becoming more important with

424
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:15,140
the autonomous vehicles these

425
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,519
self-driving vehicles they could be

426
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,490
weaponized now so you need to really

427
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,500
make sure those are secure and so like

428
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,990
companies like Toyota they actually pen

429
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,389
test their cars a lot of the I heard not

430
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,950
too long ago its Harley Davidson was

431
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:29,539
adding like a bug bounty or something to

432
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,580
test their vehicles have you as you have

433
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,500
these computerized systems you know you

434
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,779
want to make sure that malicious actors

435
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,019
don't get control of them and hardware

436
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:40,370
not only just your routers and switches

437
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,919
you get Internet of Things you got

438
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:46,279
medical devices like pacemakers insulin

439
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,289
pumps I've done wireless pen tests on

440
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,820
hospitals and it's interesting to go

441
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,649
through there and see like insulin pumps

442
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,700
and different things medical devices

443
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:57,860
connected to the network then let's the

444
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,690
IOT it's becoming popular the connected

445
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,750
home stuff all these industrial controls

446
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,309
so these are areas that people a lot of

447
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,470
times will specialize in these are areas

448
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,928
that would be an overlooked and of these

449
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,330
the ways people you know sometimes is

450
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,519
through the special devices IOT web

451
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,740
application because people are starting

452
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,429
to get their security right they're

453
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,860
starting to get their intrusion

454
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,419
detection systems and prevention systems

455
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,668
set up their employment protection and

456
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:25,820
really locking it down so now it's left

457
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:28,399
up to hackers to walk into to hack in

458
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,559
through Wireless militia act malicious

459
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:32,029
actors will use like IOT devices cuz

460
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,620
when they first come out people that

461
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:35,450
really pledged much security on them a

462
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,489
lot of them have default usernames and

463
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,809
passwords so these are pretty important

464
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,179
and if you're one to get into area the

465
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,740
areas that that's probably a good area

466
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,380
that's just kind of fairly new is like

467
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,480
the IOT and hardware stuff it's kind of

468
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,250
starting up so if you if you understand

469
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,970
that technology that may be a good area

470
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,080
for you to go into you in type in

471
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,710
testing knowledge so when you're doing

472
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,418
your tenth pen test the malicious actor

473
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,149
would see something would be like a

474
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:03,980
black box test they don't see typically

475
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:06,590
you know they're doing all their

476
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,950
reconnaissance finding all the IPS in

477
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,499
your

478
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,389
to do their test whereas if you're doing

479
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,639
this as a pen tester it's usually

480
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:16,519
limited to maybe IP addresses or URLs I

481
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:17,899
did a pen test where I only knew the

482
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,009
company name their physical address

483
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:20,869
because we had to test the physical

484
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,850
security so I had to search through

485
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:25,158
Internet look through the internet

486
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,408
looking for IP blocks looking for

487
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,970
different domain names and through doing

488
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:31,759
like a show dance search I was able to

489
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,279
find a server that wasn't even showing

490
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,980
up in their IP blocks it was and was in

491
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,869
Indonesia and it was an FTP server and

492
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,450
the way showed and found it was through

493
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:43,609
the HTTP banner and you know the login

494
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,470
were you log into FTP it gives like the

495
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,850
company name or the warning as you log

496
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,230
in and they had the company's name in

497
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,658
the banner so I was able to find it that

498
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,249
way and white-box testing are also

499
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,629
referred to as Crystal box testing it

500
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:56,419
was more like you can see through you're

501
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:58,609
able to see things more clear this is

502
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:01,970
could be anything from detailed system

503
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:03,559
diagrams network diagrams accounts and

504
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,960
this is very popular in application

505
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,340
testing because with application you

506
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,269
really need to test authenticated

507
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,559
because there's certain things that

508
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,389
admin should even see admin shouldn't

509
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,789
see Social Security numbers and account

510
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:18,439
numbers and those type of things and

511
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:20,570
personal information they shouldn't go

512
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,009
see other thing as well as lower-level

513
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:27,230
users shouldn't be able to do admin

514
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:28,850
function so pen test it's good to use

515
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,820
several accounts for each level of

516
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,168
access and also these in the gray box is

517
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,029
kind of more of what you see in your

518
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:37,940
typical pen test you've got IP addresses

519
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:39,580
URLs and so this is typically what

520
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,139
you're more of your pen tests are like

521
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,999
and all these two else will be based on

522
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:47,689
the amount of time you have if you have

523
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:49,789
a lot of time and you're gonna want to

524
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,529
know you a black box test may be

525
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:54,559
appropriate because you get more time to

526
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:56,299
to do recon enumerate targets and do

527
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,070
your testing if we got like a short

528
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:59,749
amount of time there's white box testing

529
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,519
you can more thoroughly test the system

530
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:03,769
and with white box testing you can more

531
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,269
thoroughly test regardless of time we

532
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,279
could have an admin access maybe you

533
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:08,929
can't get past that first layer just

534
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,549
logging into the system but if you're

535
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:15,259
able to log in there may be all sorts of

536
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:16,759
vulnerabilities underlying there in

537
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:18,049
different types of phases with

538
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,980
throughout the pen test so you've got

539
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,660
like your vulnerability scans there's

540
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,790
usually dedicated apartments that just

541
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,080
do vulnerability scanning but the first

542
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,060
part of a penetration test is

543
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,040
vulnerability scanning and this is just

544
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,629
running your scanner and then you have

545
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,159
your vulnerability assessments so

546
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,590
vulnerability assessments is you're

547
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,470
running your vulnerability scans you're

548
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,270
in map scans the port port scanners have

549
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,430
been testing and you're going in after

550
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,870
the after you do those the scans you

551
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,840
make sure those vulnerabilities are

552
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,610
actually not false positives so you run

553
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,800
other tools or may have do manual

554
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,169
techniques to make sure that they are

555
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,060
legitimate vulnerabilities and so the

556
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,890
next step in sometimes companies will

557
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,020
have only a vulnerability assessment if

558
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,330
it's kind of a really fragile 'n the

559
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,389
viral spin test I did at the hospital

560
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,520
once they started seeing what could what

561
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,110
the possibilities were they realized

562
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,090
okay we have these medical devices on

563
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,409
there we can't have an outage you know

564
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,530
so we did there as we just did some

565
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:15,360
scanning and then we did like a I did

566
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,430
like a config assessment of the wireless

567
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,770
controller just to kind of see what kind

568
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,350
of protections there you know to avoid

569
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:25,139
taking guiding systems so vulnerability

570
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,120
assessments can be conducted you know on

571
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,680
the by themselves and sometimes there's

572
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,850
a need for it but the pin test is the

573
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,370
next level so you're basically taking

574
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,419
your vulnerability assessment and then

575
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,719
you're seeing at those vulnerabilities

576
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,520
are exploitable and then you get to the

577
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,910
red team or adversarial tests red

578
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,200
teaming is kind of most people knows red

579
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,160
team blue team it's just generalizations

580
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,840
between offense and defense but in the

581
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,400
industry people that work as pen testers

582
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,820
or red teamers there's a little bit more

583
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,950
of a difference red teaming is more of

584
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,220
an adversarial simulation a best

585
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,050
description I've heard or for red

586
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,730
teaming is testing the blue team because

587
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,200
when you perform these tests you usually

588
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,420
maybe only to see so and very few people

589
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,830
know about it so that way the security

590
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,930
managers don't know so that way you're

591
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,370
testing the security teams if someone's

592
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,930
hacking into the system you're hoping

593
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,550
that your sock is seeing the information

594
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,200
seeing this information coming through

595
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,850
you're hoping that they're able to block

596
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,650
it that your Incident Response Team

597
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,540
they're performing the way they want to

598
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,610
and so this is a way to test it's kind

599
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,909
of a report card for for the blue team

600
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,889
and so this is the the

601
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,810
it's more of a real attack simulation

602
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,190
and it's less restrictive and skill and

603
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,080
these are the ones as far as being a pen

604
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,850
tester these are a lot more fun this is

605
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,460
typically what people think pen testing

606
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,590
is but it's not always usually the scope

607
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,450
is a little more narrow but with the red

608
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,429
teaming stuff easily physical and social

609
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,430
engineering is usually in scope in

610
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,190
specializations most people most pen

611
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,169
testers fall into the the generalist

612
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,560
category you didn't network Wi-Fi maybe

613
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,850
some light web app if you're doing

614
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,370
network pen testing and you know enough

615
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,810
enough web app pen testing because

616
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,629
you're gonna run into systems on the

617
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:09,409
network maybe it's some admin console or

618
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,690
some system the kind of application and

619
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,550
that may be your only way to hack into

620
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:17,720
the network is to get past that web

621
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:19,580
application and then specialization you

622
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,350
know supposed to come in through there

623
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,710
from a sysadmin background or someone

624
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,939
worked in IT or security application pen

625
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,460
testing usually people that are

626
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,500
developers people that have worked as

627
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,260
what developers will move in this area

628
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,520
because they understand the coding and

629
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,440
they understand how applications work

630
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,030
and then you have social engineering and

631
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,730
a lot of this falls under like the red

632
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,830
team's a physical and building that

633
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,970
falls under red team a lot that becomes

634
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,590
part of the duties and then

635
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:52,190
transportation some people specialize

636
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:56,600
and just testing automobiles and

637
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:59,390
airplanes buses etc and how to become a

638
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,889
pen tester and so the first thing you

639
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,210
need you need to understand the

640
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,520
technology you're trying to hack before

641
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,460
you can break into it so you need to

642
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,080
understand networking you need to

643
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,910
understand operating systems Windows and

644
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,520
Linux look for like a sysadmin level

645
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,950
because if you get a shell or a command

646
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,629
line to that server if you don't

647
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,280
understand the operating system then

648
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,780
there's not much you can do so if you

649
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,460
know the operating system you can shut

650
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,550
down the firewall and you can add users

651
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,440
and and so far so you really need to

652
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,000
note that the operating system you

653
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,400
really need to know from assists admin

654
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,470
level and then you need understanding of

655
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,210
security and there's some somewhat of

656
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,880
understanding applications but not as

657
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,690
deep and then hardware one of the things

658
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,399
that the

659
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,200
will address this knowledge that you

660
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,178
need if you don't have these is you

661
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,330
could just go through like professor

662
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:50,779
Messer videos and do like a plus for the

663
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:53,119
operating systems a plus content network

664
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,960
plus and security plus and this will get

665
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,259
you up to speed

666
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,619
knowing that content to to progress to

667
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,609
the next level even hacking knowledge

668
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,859
once you know these are the things

669
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,330
you've got a lot of know-how to hack and

670
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:08,749
so that was me when I started out I had

671
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:11,928
an application security background and I

672
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:13,399
was doing vulnerability scans and so I

673
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:15,109
didn't know have the hacking skills so I

674
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,340
had learn how to hack so I ended up

675
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:19,249
signing up for the offensive security

676
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,539
course for the OS CP and there's how I

677
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:23,149
learned how to hack but to learn how to

678
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,710
hack there's a various classes out there

679
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:27,439
some a lot of colleges starting to add

680
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:30,139
ethical hacking classes conferences such

681
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,039
as these meetings meetups a really good

682
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:35,478
area good areas to learn how to hack

683
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:40,460
self-study anything from home labs

684
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:41,869
videos tutorials blogs and articles CTF

685
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,769
Twitter's a real good place to find

686
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:47,059
information on security there's a

687
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:49,279
referred to as InfoSec twitter so a lot

688
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:50,869
of people that you see it DEFCON and

689
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,330
some of the big conferences like that or

690
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,738
posting some of their research and tools

691
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,899
out there and some of their techniques

692
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:59,779
so it's a really good place to take it

693
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,158
information and the hacker mindset this

694
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,139
is you know learning how to hack

695
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,779
developing that mindset the hacker

696
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:07,939
mindset is kind of a culmination of

697
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:09,289
creativity and analytics so if you got

698
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,210
an analytical mind you have to use some

699
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:13,279
creativity because you may run an

700
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,190
exploit you get like a low-level shell

701
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,419
or a little access to that server then

702
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,729
you've got to figure out other ways to

703
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:21,590
get higher level access how to possibly

704
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:24,049
exploit and compromise other

705
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,609
vulnerabilities on the system so the

706
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,009
best way to build the system repititions

707
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:29,658
build a lab and then just practice

708
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,979
hacking there's a lot of good vulnerable

709
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,960
vm's that you can download but just

710
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:35,479
repetition helps you get better at it

711
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,710
and another thing way to describe the

712
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:37,759
hacker mindset it's almost like

713
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,519
troubleshooting when you learn how to

714
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,019
install you know an operating system set

715
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,460
up a network when it works perfect

716
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,729
that's good but then when things

717
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,019
breaking you try to figure it out that's

718
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:48,970
kind of the way you learn and develop

719
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,309
your trouble

720
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:56,860
skills is kind of the same way with with

721
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:58,720
with hacking skills and so the formula

722
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,510
for becoming a pen tester is not having

723
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,620
the technology knowledge the security

724
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,059
knowledge and then the hacker mindset

725
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,178
understanding how to hack and then

726
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,470
that's kind of these areas that we kind

727
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:12,039
of covered that you need to know and

728
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:14,679
that will help you on your path to

729
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:19,360
becoming a penetration tester where to

730
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:21,130
start you need to develop a plan so if

731
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,840
you have no idea experience then you're

732
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,929
starting from scratch you need to learn

733
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,428
the basics the operating systems

734
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:29,559
hardware and networking so like going

735
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:32,710
through the a plus security plus a

736
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,970
network plus that content and you can go

737
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,350
for that you can study that learn the

738
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,240
materials don't just try to get the

739
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,500
certification and that's like any

740
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,580
certification to understand the

741
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,770
materials because you interview for a

742
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,120
job and you can have a sand

743
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,710
certification but if you don't

744
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,840
understand what you're doing you're

745
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,309
gonna bomb the technical interview and

746
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,658
so if you have experience with IT and

747
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:52,629
you don't know Linux then you need to

748
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:54,340
learn Linux security and networking if

749
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,480
you work in InfoSec fill in the gaps

750
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,340
that you're missing there maybe you

751
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,340
haven't worked with Linux much line lytx

752
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,299
do CTF

753
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,280
bug bounties because capture the flags

754
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:07,330
are pretty good some of them are better

755
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,280
than others some of the more hacker

756
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:14,199
focus but some of them work more

757
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,879
different InfoSec challenges but there's

758
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,409
some out there that are more that are

759
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,360
more hacker late and those are the ones

760
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:20,500
you want to find like I've been doing

761
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,928
stuff like hack the box

762
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,950
yeah then bug bounties are a good way to

763
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,690
get experience because you're actually

764
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,490
working on live production environments

765
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,590
and when you're doing these Ted these

766
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,120
these tests them for these bug bounties

767
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,220
then you're able you're getting

768
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,178
experience on how to do pen tests so

769
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,850
when you're going through an interview

770
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:38,909
you can describe how to do certain type

771
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:43,030
attacks describe how to do a pen test

772
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:44,710
and so those so that's helpful and then

773
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,658
everyone in any level needs to build a

774
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,049
lab I even have a lab now and I've been

775
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:52,120
in 9004 22 years and pen testing for for

776
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,440
quite a while so it's you know labs also

777
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,780
a good place to test your proof of

778
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,290
concepts maybe you found an exploit and

779
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,220
you're going to

780
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:01,690
it's a good idea to test it in a lab

781
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,010
environment before you actually test it

782
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,480
on the network because there are some

783
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,790
exploits that actually break a system

784
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,220
and if you're doing this for your for an

785
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,950
employer or you're a consultant for a

786
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,820
customer you don't want to break their

787
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,320
their environment because then they're

788
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,300
gonna get really mad and then all of a

789
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,780
sudden you're having the test after

790
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,730
hours and your scope is more narrow and

791
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:25,480
then makes it the pen test a lot more

792
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:27,730
uncomfortable after that and then your

793
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,620
lab setup we've got three categories

794
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,120
here your minimalist lab this is just

795
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,669
taking a computer or a laptop

796
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,260
I like the laptop idea because you can

797
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,550
take it with you anywhere maybe you're

798
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,960
working at home studying for all you get

799
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,300
bored you may want to go to a coffee

800
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,310
shop or library somewhere the study just

801
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,350
to have a change of scenery and then

802
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:47,470
dedicated labs so this is you can have

803
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:49,719
like a separate server set up to hold

804
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,220
your vulnerable VMs and then there's

805
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,990
advanced you can actually build the

806
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,150
servers and the computers the clients on

807
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,950
there the routers and switches if you

808
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,930
hadn't done that before this would be a

809
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,070
good exercise but one thing to keep in

810
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,540
mind when you're getting advanced like

811
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,889
that you may spend more time

812
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,860
troubleshooting your network than

813
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,270
actually practice and pen testing

814
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,709
because I actually used to I used to do

815
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:12,340
web design on the side and I taught

816
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:14,860
myself web design and you know hosted my

817
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,530
customers websites on my computer at

818
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,320
home and I had Red Hat Linux and Apache

819
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:22,360
web server hosting DNS and I was using

820
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,010
like second hand hardware so I'd upgrade

821
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,740
my system and then that became my server

822
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,420
and I spent too much time with repairing

823
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,430
that to do web design and so I end up

824
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,480
going to web host so it's kind of same

825
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,270
thing with your home lab if you're

826
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,740
spending too much time fixing and

827
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,889
troubleshooting is you're getting less

828
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,630
time to study and then your attack

829
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:43,300
platforms this is the system using an

830
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:45,340
attacker pump mob with Kali Linux is the

831
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,060
one I highly recommend it's been around

832
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,370
longer

833
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,560
rest was originally backtrack Linux is

834
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,110
really what took pentesting away from

835
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:56,080
doing it on a Windows platform to a

836
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,780
Linux platform all the tools began to be

837
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,050
written in Linux and so Kali Linux all

838
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:04,210
the different tools out there work on

839
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,070
Kali Linux and in the repositories

840
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,140
online to install those apps and all the

841
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,270
popular tools are on there and some

842
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,460
tools that don't a repository are easier

843
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:14,020
to set up on Kali Linux I did tool one

844
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,480
time that's gonna set up on a bun to you

845
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,370
and it wasn't working out but I put on

846
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,170
Kali Linux and it worked real well but

847
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,209
peridot s is pretty good they even have

848
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:26,140
like some tour related stuff built into

849
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:28,870
it and it's you get if you want your

850
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,640
system to be more secure from you know

851
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,110
other attack from attackers or something

852
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,180
on your testing they supposed to have

853
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,620
some really good security features and

854
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,450
then Ubuntu you with the pen tester

855
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,669
framework the pen tester framework is by

856
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,770
trusted sec and it's a script that

857
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,840
installs the different pen testing tools

858
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,670
and hacking tools on your system so that

859
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,230
may be a way you want to go if you're

860
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,970
installing it bare metal just on your

861
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,550
system then you've got a little more

862
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,870
security controls there you have a

863
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,430
little more control over your system if

864
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,050
you want to go that route and then

865
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,420
there's commando vm which runs on

866
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,250
Windows 7 and Windows 10 and this is

867
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,840
similar to the pen tester framework

868
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,240
being that it's scripts that automates

869
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,459
the installs of the tools and on top of

870
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,620
that it's nice bouquet it also sets up

871
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,690
the security to install these tools

872
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,870
because you try to install Metasploit on

873
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:16,840
a on just the windows box without

874
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,909
modifying the security then a lot of

875
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,290
times your antivirus will sit there and

876
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,179
delete your your payloads from

877
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,219
Metasploit so this makes it nice it sets

878
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:26,290
up like the security it takes about

879
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:28,060
three hours to install and if you like

880
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:30,029
to do reversing or you want to set up

881
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,409
reversing on there they have a flare vm

882
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,300
script to set up reversing tools in

883
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,830
there as well which I recommend but both

884
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,380
those take about three three hours to

885
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:41,259
install but it's a really nice setup I

886
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,990
think as this gets more popular I can

887
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,550
see more people going over to you to

888
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:47,000
using this and it's a good idea to have

889
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,440
like run a VM above

890
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,889
they're having a system running Linux

891
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,230
and Windows for your pen tests sometimes

892
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,380
some there's tools that come native on

893
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:01,340
Windows that work better for hacking

894
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:03,920
Windows then then on Linux and then on

895
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,590
your lab the targets you can create VMS

896
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,900
from ball hub there's and vulnerable VMS

897
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,600
up there like Meadows Metasploit herbal

898
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:14,390
2 & 3 and also there's a lot of retired

899
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,049
CTF VM so a lot of the conference's the

900
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:20,060
CTF still later on just upload the VM to

901
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:21,200
view a ball hub so they're constantly

902
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,690
updating that it's a really good

903
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,790
resource Metasploit will 2 & 3 are the

904
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,110
ones I recommend to start out with and

905
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,490
when you're building your lab you can

906
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,740
have multiple VMs but the nice thing

907
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:33,169
about these projects like Metasploit

908
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,370
well 2 & 3 is they've got several

909
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,840
exploits on there there's several

910
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,580
different exploits you can try out so

911
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,800
you don't have to have a lot of systems

912
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,560
to be able to exploit these different

913
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,180
vulnerabilities in a wasp webgoat they

914
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,500
have a couple versions out there it's

915
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,799
really good for what about pen testing

916
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,570
and if you actually go to a wasp it got

917
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,670
a lot of other vulnerable VMs link

918
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,340
there's different sites that are set up

919
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,840
for just practice and pen testing or you

920
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,700
can create your own VM targets so you

921
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,190
can go out to exploit DB which is

922
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:04,279
popularly unheard of it it's a website

923
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:06,380
that hosts the different exploits that

924
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,090
you can use on your pen test so you can

925
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,340
actually download the vulnerable

926
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,410
software and then build your VMs from

927
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,810
that so you want to do something more

928
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:18,259
custom or if you want to build a CTF

929
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,520
that's a good way to go and recommended

930
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,020
reading so if you're getting started

931
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,700
with this the might the book I highly

932
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,670
recommend and I used to use this from my

933
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:28,069
course manual is penetration testing a

934
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,960
hands-on introduction to hacking by

935
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,490
Georgia Weidman this is a really good

936
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,710
one and it takes you to on how to build

937
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,109
a lab and if you have any problems the

938
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,330
books kind of a few years old process

939
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,130
updating the book so if you have any

940
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,960
problems you can contact the author and

941
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,700
she will give you links to some

942
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,530
downloads for some of the software some

943
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,359
of the vulnerable software people have

944
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,160
had a hard time finding but I was using

945
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,710
this for my course manual and we went to

946
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,540
the pen test plus materials this this

947
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,150
past spring semester to give students a

948
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,230
certification to to work on but anyone

949
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,630
starting out especially on your own

950
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,670
learning

951
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,410
testing I would start with that and then

952
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,960
the hackers playbook to was the one I

953
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,339
would go to next hacker played with the

954
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,799
hackers playbook three is good as well

955
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:09,119
but it gets into more red teaming so you

956
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:11,369
definitely want to start with two to

957
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,720
learn the pen testing aspect and who I

958
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:15,240
learned red teaming then you can move on

959
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,649
to three but these are three books I

960
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,258
highly recommend then there's the red

961
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:22,259
team filled manual that's a good

962
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:25,529
reference it has like different Linux

963
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:27,839
commands Windows commands Cisco syntax

964
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:29,670
and Maps syntax so it's really handy a

965
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,980
little guy and it's like ten bucks on

966
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:35,009
Amazon really small lightweight easy to

967
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,839
carry and in your your laptop bag with

968
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:38,160
you and also the web application

969
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,808
hacker's handbook this is one of the

970
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,240
best books for learning web application

971
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:44,190
pen testing and action this is the book

972
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,919
actually used for my web application pen

973
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:51,750
testing class and learning resources

974
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,150
this this list here starts from the most

975
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:56,400
expensive to least expensive so you have

976
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,710
the SANS Institute which they're like

977
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,119
currently like 6600 they're going up to

978
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,769
seventy two hundred dollars next year

979
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,529
so if you're doing that on your own dime

980
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:06,328
that kind of gets a little expensive and

981
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:08,880
then you learn security this drops

982
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:11,099
drastically you'll spend around twelve

983
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,329
hundred bucks on their premium level of

984
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:14,910
the course they have different levels

985
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:17,849
they have like bare-bones which gives

986
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:20,279
you the content you have to access it

987
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:23,420
online as you progress in levels you get

988
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:26,970
more lab time and then you also get

989
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,250
you're able to access download PDFs of

990
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,200
the material to make training more

991
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:34,140
portable and this isn't really this

992
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,399
that's a really good series of training

993
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,480
actually went through the way that pen

994
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,250
testing course when I was getting

995
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,279
started pen testing and also their

996
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,420
mobile app pen testing course and

997
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,920
virtual hacking labs this is a real good

998
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,319
one if you're studying for the osc p

999
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,119
they have a nice little course on there

1000
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,670
and they have a really good lab the lab

1001
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,500
targets a little more modern than like

1002
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,000
the osep targets and they even have like

1003
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,099
an android device you can hack on there

1004
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,720
so it's really good a really good

1005
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:03,269
resource and then the least expensive

1006
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,069
guys keeping it myself but so pentester

1007
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:06,959
academy this is a really good it's like

1008
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:08,130
recently it's like sixty nine dollars a

1009
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,090
month they've got like close to a

1010
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,950
thousand labs

1011
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,260
and they're continually to create labs

1012
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:15,089
they've got course content and videos on

1013
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,800
there so you've got the learning

1014
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,590
materials that you can go through before

1015
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,290
you go through the labs and some of the

1016
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:25,260
labs will even show you links back to

1017
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:27,540
where to find the learning materials for

1018
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:31,400
for that particular labs so it's really

1019
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:34,500
good and pentester lab this one is

1020
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,910
geared more towards webapp but the nice

1021
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,890
thing is is they take you through things

1022
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,680
that would give you like shell access or

1023
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,390
command line access to a server and then

1024
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,190
out of these the least-expensive

1025
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,810
it's a really good value as practical

1026
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,810
Penn test labs it's like sixty four

1027
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:52,320
dollars for lifetime access and you have

1028
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:54,480
a VPN you set up the VPN on your system

1029
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,750
and then you run your pen testing you're

1030
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,670
in hack against the targets on there and

1031
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,290
then bugcrowd University for learning

1032
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,690
web app pen testing they have some good

1033
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,370
resources there and the Sands pen

1034
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,020
testing blog they have a lot of good

1035
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,960
cheat sheets on nmap and some of the

1036
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,330
different tools and Metasploit and then

1037
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,050
hacking tutorials org hacking tutorials

1038
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:17,610
org this course this site is created by

1039
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,710
virtual hacking labs so they have a lot

1040
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,840
of tutorials on using some of the most

1041
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,640
common tools like in map some of the

1042
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,860
open floor open source vulnerability

1043
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,799
scanners so this one is a good one and

1044
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,140
it's free and cyber I got IT they cast a

1045
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,760
good free content on there on pen

1046
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,390
testing I actually use the advanced pen

1047
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,760
testing videos in my course last last

1048
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,140
year when I was using the book by

1049
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,670
Georgia Whiteman because she actually

1050
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,980
did the Advanced Course on there and

1051
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,510
they have videos of the different

1052
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,390
sections from the book so that's a

1053
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:55,110
really great resource let's say and then

1054
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:58,620
the web applicat imme this is written by

1055
00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:00,600
the creators of burp suite and also the

1056
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,120
writers of the book the web application

1057
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,500
hacker's handbook instead of upgrading

1058
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,569
the web application hacker's handbook

1059
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,000
they went ahead and start offering the

1060
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,380
learning content online as well as free

1061
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,360
online labs so this is a really good

1062
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,440
resource and this is actually that some

1063
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,530
of the labs and I useful

1064
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,920
that pentesting class and then a wasp

1065
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:22,170
don't work this is a great resource for

1066
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,839
learning how to in documents on securing

1067
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:27,000
applications as well as learning pen

1068
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:28,859
tested web app pen testing they also

1069
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,290
have guide they have a guy for doing pen

1070
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:33,450
where that pen test on there a wasp zap

1071
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:37,460
is one of their products that they have

1072
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:41,399
it's a free vulnerability and proxy

1073
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:43,560
attack application it's pretty similar

1074
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,480
to four to Barb sweet but it's

1075
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:50,279
completely free and then over the wire

1076
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,930
CTF is a good option for CTF there's

1077
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,339
someone out there that are basically

1078
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,200
Linux so you really get to learn Linux

1079
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:57,150
security pretty well and then half the

1080
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,189
box this is a given week a lot of people

1081
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:02,369
that go through the OSC P will do this I

1082
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:05,819
saw recently or earlier this week a

1083
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:07,500
couple of months ago there was a kid

1084
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:08,940
from the UK a high school kid and he

1085
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,280
just went through hack the box for a

1086
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,680
year and then went through the osep

1087
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,079
materials and passed the the osep exam

1088
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,540
first try so that's a really good

1089
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,210
resource and at the bottom of the page

1090
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,490
there's a URL if you can see that it's

1091
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:27,329
the hacker maker comm port slash

1092
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,700
learning - resources and on this page I

1093
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:31,650
have this information from this slide

1094
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,250
all these learning resources as well as

1095
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,450
a video of this talk and the slide deck

1096
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,859
case of the slide deck would be

1097
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,020
available on there through SlideShare so

1098
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:44,098
if you go to that link you have all the

1099
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:46,770
information from this talk and then

1100
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:48,089
certifications certifications although

1101
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,589
you need to know the material sometimes

1102
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:51,660
certifications help you get your foot in

1103
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:53,578
the door and some of the intro level

1104
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,129
certs is the CH which most people heard

1105
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:59,310
of HR really knows about this in

1106
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,780
management so sometimes these job

1107
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,609
descriptions are written by people that

1108
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,410
I understand pentesting so that's

1109
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:06,150
usually the the certification that they

1110
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,609
look for if this didn't have a lot of

1111
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,319
input from someone with fantastic

1112
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:11,910
experience pentest plus is fairly new

1113
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,980
but it's a good it's a good

1114
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,629
certification and they I like the fact

1115
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,190
that they cover the methodology of pen

1116
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,530
tests they don't just teach you the

1117
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:21,460
tools they teach you the different

1118
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,560
standards and how to go through a pen

1119
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,599
and it's really really well-designed

1120
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,089
they have people from the industry help

1121
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,430
create this and when they were working

1122
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:32,890
on it they actually brought people in up

1123
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,529
to Chicago to help develop that content

1124
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:38,109
so they had actually industry input and

1125
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,640
your intermediate certifications these

1126
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:42,520
get to be a little more difficult like

1127
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:45,000
your sans Jeep in this is an exam

1128
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,920
question to answer exam good information

1129
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,070
a little more expensive than the osep

1130
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,440
option offensive Security's osep this

1131
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,970
one the certification doesn't expire you

1132
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,580
actually have to hack into targets to

1133
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,319
get to get this certification you've got

1134
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,180
like 24 hours to complete the test

1135
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:05,020
and it's really well-respected in the

1136
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,940
community my second pin test job they a

1137
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,619
lot of companies will set up a lab with

1138
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,230
a vulnerable VM have you do a pen test

1139
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:13,270
or hack into it just to test your skill

1140
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:16,780
set and due to having that certification

1141
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:19,450
they waived my my test the time to do

1142
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,950
that technical test for them and so it's

1143
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,410
it's a really good one to get your foot

1144
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,180
in the door with when you look at most

1145
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,640
pen test job descriptions they're

1146
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:30,399
looking for the sans G pen are the OSD P

1147
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,960
but the osep that's the one course I

1148
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,030
took that I've learned them the most

1149
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,530
from as long as I've been pen testing

1150
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,180
and then you get into more you're more

1151
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,950
advanced certification just like the G

1152
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,690
XP n by sans

1153
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:44,890
this one's advanced pen testing and

1154
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:47,140
exploit development and OSC is osce is a

1155
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:50,740
similar one although you have an actual

1156
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,930
lab you have to go in and hack items and

1157
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,118
write exploits and do equivalents to

1158
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:57,160
like zero days so this is a really good

1159
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,050
one good to have on your resume so if

1160
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,240
you like the OS CP or osce then that

1161
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,650
makes you you know you'll get hit up by

1162
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,890
a lot of recruiters on LinkedIn when

1163
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,510
they see that and like I said make sure

1164
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:12,129
you know the content and the good thing

1165
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:14,589
about the offensive security classes as

1166
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,780
well as elearn security you're actually

1167
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:19,290
doing stuff live in the lab on the fifth

1168
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,369
of the elearn security certifications

1169
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,420
they actually require you to do a pen

1170
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:23,950
test for that they give you a little

1171
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,380
more time I think you got like a week or

1172
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:28,060
something so it's a little better for

1173
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,099
some people schedules that you can do it

1174
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,360
from you know normal hours opposed down

1175
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:33,210
this

1176
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:37,290
at 24 hours straight to do it to do the

1177
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:38,550
osep example the elearn security some

1178
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,320
companies are kind of recognizing is

1179
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,270
catching on more but it's really a good

1180
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,580
first step to start with so if you're

1181
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,140
wanting to do the OS CP I would start

1182
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,850
with something like elearn Security's

1183
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,930
pen test course because they go in a lot

1184
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:52,410
more detail when you're going through

1185
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:54,810
the OS CP it's actually they don't say

1186
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,339
it's they it's made to sound like an

1187
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,840
entry-level course but you really need

1188
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,850
to be working as a pen tester for a

1189
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,610
while because going in and it took me

1190
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,900
when I started as a pen tester I started

1191
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,660
the course to learn hacking and it took

1192
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:09,150
me a year to get to it and passed the

1193
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:11,009
exam so I would recommend you had like

1194
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:15,180
two or three years experience or do some

1195
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:16,440
pre pre training for that do some you

1196
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,330
know training on your own to get up to

1197
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,100
speed before you start that and you

1198
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,610
learn and security is a really good way

1199
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,410
to do that I have to go the virtual

1200
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,920
hacking labs is a good resource for that

1201
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,620
to you as well

1202
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,940
so some job tips professional networking

1203
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,130
going to meetups and conferences like

1204
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,440
this my last two full-time jobs were

1205
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:37,230
through meetups I got my second pentest

1206
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,330
job to Dallas hackers Association my

1207
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,730
third pentest job I got through in local

1208
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,230
Olas meeting the presenter there the

1209
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,760
company he was working for the one I

1210
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,470
currently work at they had openings and

1211
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,450
it was 100% remote and I want to do a

1212
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,129
remote job so just getting out there

1213
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,839
when you go these conferences network

1214
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,520
with people talk to people just don't be

1215
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,200
quiet in the corner no one's gonna know

1216
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,750
your skill set or you're looking for a

1217
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,029
job a lot of these meetups will do like

1218
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,230
a looking at who's hiring and then some

1219
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,490
of the conference's will even give

1220
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,460
wristbands to show that you're looking

1221
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:07,379
for a job so take advantage of those you

1222
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,060
know go talk to people I there's been

1223
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,710
people that I've met that I knew they

1224
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,420
want to get into pentesting and had

1225
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,220
people looking for entry-level

1226
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,320
pentesters since I teach and that's a go

1227
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,299
hacking class and I submitted a few of

1228
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,310
my students that were qualified to do

1229
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,660
the court they can do the work and then

1230
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:24,299
I need someone from the local community

1231
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,190
it recently graduated from University of

1232
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,010
North Texas I'd seen him for several

1233
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:31,740
years and doing pretty well and you knew

1234
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:33,780
he was a good would be a good asset and

1235
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,049
so I recommended him and he fortunately

1236
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,970
in it for him he and again

1237
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:38,140
so just known people in the community

1238
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,299
who a lot of times we'll help each other

1239
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,430
out with jobs so so that's a real good

1240
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,230
thing to leverage there so a good place

1241
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:47,620
to find your meetups is going meetup

1242
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:49,360
calm look for your local chapters your

1243
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,359
local DEFCON groups that's a easy way to

1244
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,420
find that like your you know San Antonio

1245
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,620
you have San Antonio hackers association

1246
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,810
then you get Austin they have Austin

1247
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,990
hackers Association and Houston has some

1248
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:03,100
meetup groups so there's good groups to

1249
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,259
not only can you learn there it's a good

1250
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,549
place to professionally network

1251
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,500
interviewing tips when you go through a

1252
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,350
pen test interview you would think some

1253
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:14,110
things like the three-way TCP handshake

1254
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:16,569
or the OSI model will be left out when

1255
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:18,700
you get a lot of hiring managers you

1256
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,980
know since pin testing is really as far

1257
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,839
as popularity is kind of a new thing as

1258
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:28,600
far as the relevance and as long as it's

1259
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:29,950
been been more of a needed process some

1260
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,720
of these managers they come back from

1261
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,859
they come from there were sysadmin Zoar

1262
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,080
network administrators so they're gonna

1263
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,030
ask you some of the basic stuff like OSI

1264
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,650
model through a TCP handshake when

1265
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,240
you're pen test interviews you're

1266
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,490
typically always gonna get asked

1267
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,379
questions from the last top ten so it's

1268
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:45,910
a good thing to understand those that

1269
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,110
top 10 gets a better read it because you

1270
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,450
can learn a lot of good stuff you can

1271
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,460
find out why these vulnerabilities can

1272
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,470
be exploited why it's a risk and so just

1273
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,940
understand that a lost top 10 you're

1274
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,709
always gonna make typically get asked

1275
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,930
about sequel injection the different

1276
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,120
types cross-site scripting the different

1277
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,770
types how to remediate those and so if

1278
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,450
you understand that that goes a long way

1279
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,440
in the interview we've had people that

1280
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,540
would come through that we've

1281
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,850
interviewed and and they've kind of

1282
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,160
gotten good marks from the team because

1283
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:14,080
they understood and maybe some people

1284
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,879
didn't understand the exact terms that

1285
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:19,090
they could describe it in a way that you

1286
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:23,110
understood the things they knew what the

1287
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:24,820
vulnerabilities were and this is my

1288
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,340
contact information so feel free to

1289
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:30,010
reach out to me on LinkedIn email or

1290
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,270
Twitter and there's information for the

1291
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,100
palm school project if you go to the

1292
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:36,190
palm school project if you're ever in

1293
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,830
the Dallas area there's like a link to

1294
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:40,780
meet up so you can go to attend our

1295
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:42,250
meetings and also there's a link to the

1296
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,190
YouTube page I've got some videos we

1297
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:47,380
usually record and stream our content

1298
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:50,080
and then also teach ethical hacking what

1299
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:51,610
about pentesting Richland College and if

1300
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,080
you go to my web site the hacker maker

1301
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:56,290
you can find some information on the

1302
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,000
classes I usually put the the course

1303
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,770
numbers because trying to navigate the

1304
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,420
college page is kind of hard if you

1305
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:03,310
search on ethical hacking you won't find

1306
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,080
the course again of the course numbers

1307
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:07,480
and stuff so I do this to make it easier

1308
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:11,549
and so that concludes the prepared

1309
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,550
content and I'm now open up to questions

1310
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:23,140
anyone have any questions like I said if

1311
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,520
you want to go back and get the slides

1312
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,150
you can go back to the learning

1313
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,150
resources page

1314
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,970
what's up

1315
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:49,760
yeah I highly recommend mentors that's

1316
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:51,950
how I got started into teaching and

1317
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,540
running palm school I would find other

1318
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,390
people that want to go through the OS CP

1319
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,920
wanted to be a pen tester and and over

1320
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,690
the years I've mentored them a lot of it

1321
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,000
you know mentoring scut mentoring comes

1322
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,230
on different levels and a lot of people

1323
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,090
on Twitter you can send them direct

1324
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,680
messages and they'll answer answer your

1325
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,840
questions but it comes in different

1326
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,250
levels sometimes it's just what I need

1327
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,350
to start with what are some good basic

1328
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,330
resources and most the people I've

1329
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:16,190
experienced mentoring have asked for

1330
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,630
just that beginning information and I

1331
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,760
have people that I mentor that I have

1332
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,650
like weekly calls with sometimes this

1333
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,380
monthly calls so finding someone to

1334
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,580
mentor you is a good way to good way to

1335
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,960
learn they can save you a lot of the

1336
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,340
headache because there's learning

1337
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,320
resources out there and you may not know

1338
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,510
what's good and so you can have wasting

1339
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,280
your time the money on a course and so

1340
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,750
by having mentors you can at least find

1341
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,180
out some of the learning content that's

1342
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:41,120
good and get some advice on careers and

1343
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,980
stuff so I'd highly recommend getting a

1344
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,569
mentor to even be in a rapport because

1345
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,850
you no matter what level your career

1346
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:48,080
you're at maybe you've been on helpdesk

1347
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:50,540
for a year or two there's still someone

1348
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:53,000
that can learn something from you and I

1349
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,890
highly recommend that you know receive

1350
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,570
new training and people kind of helped

1351
00:51:54,890 --> 00:52:01,569
you to kind of pay it back yes

1352
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:14,040
no ICP that one's that one's a good one

1353
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:15,450
but I haven't seen a lot of people

1354
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,670
looking for that I would say if you're

1355
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,348
want to do though is CP and learn Kali

1356
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:22,589
Linux that would be a good way to really

1357
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:23,970
learn the operating system at least go

1358
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:25,230
through the content and learn the

1359
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,049
content because you know you can get the

1360
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:30,329
online book you know download PDF or

1361
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:34,050
access the content online or buy the

1362
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:35,520
book the try thank their exam is like

1363
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:38,190
300 bucks or something but that's

1364
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,300
because you're really not I think is

1365
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:41,040
around two or three hundred dollars for

1366
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,349
that I don't really see people asking

1367
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,140
for it but it's someone that actually

1368
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:47,579
works in pen testing or something would

1369
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,470
possibly know about it but it would be

1370
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:51,750
good to learn the content so I'd go

1371
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:53,910
through there learn kali linux and that

1372
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,619
would help you out if you're just want

1373
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,089
to go through the OS CP to kind of

1374
00:52:55,619 --> 00:53:03,500
understand how the operating system

1375
00:52:57,089 --> 00:53:03,500
works in general yes

1376
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:21,429
okay

1377
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,490
okay

1378
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:41,650
let's see could you repeat the first

1379
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,039
question my way then I will answer that

1380
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,039
and then go

1381
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,059
yeah I think I think if you try

1382
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,930
translating more in business terms and

1383
00:53:58,059 --> 00:54:00,520
reputation

1384
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:03,368
show them the risks of this information

1385
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,740
you know gets leaked you know I think

1386
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:07,660
showing the risks and just kind of you

1387
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,430
know give them some examples and explain

1388
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,990
how certain vulnerabilities can be

1389
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,490
exploited which some people just think

1390
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,020
you know it's just volleyball there's

1391
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,848
nothing can happen there so if you can

1392
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,160
explain to them how those can be

1393
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:20,890
exploited and then a risk involved

1394
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,839
sometimes if you give them more business

1395
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:24,460
terms or more describe it to them you

1396
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,980
know you just can't be as technical but

1397
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,990
just kind of show different ways and how

1398
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,579
people you know how attackers can come

1399
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,348
in through externally and even internal

1400
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:34,660
employees can be a risk in contractors

1401
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:36,700
and consultants just explain the risk to

1402
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:41,740
them and then the other one you

1403
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:43,689
mentioned scoping and okay yeah so yeah

1404
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,790
you have your your your contracts and of

1405
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:48,130
course within your s OWS stuff you have

1406
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,300
like the risk the risks on there and of

1407
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:51,609
course you can still well you know you

1408
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,720
can still get yourself in trouble that

1409
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:54,400
year when you're doing that you want to

1410
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,549
make sure like the companies I've worked

1411
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,230
with they've had you know internal laws

1412
00:54:57,549 --> 00:55:01,270
law firm lawyers and stuff to go those

1413
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:03,250
contracts and make sure everything was

1414
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:05,230
covered but the really the best thing if

1415
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:07,180
you're scoping something like that is to

1416
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:09,099
go and get detail a lot of times I've

1417
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,230
seen pen tests where they weren't as

1418
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:12,700
effective is it also in your scope you

1419
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,530
need to look at the goals what are your

1420
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,649
goals from this is it is this for

1421
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:18,670
compliance this is just for security

1422
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,650
understand their goals and help them

1423
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:23,200
meet their goals and then apply that to

1424
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,549
the scope and sometimes the end users

1425
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,439
you work with don't always understand

1426
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:27,940
pen testing you know kind of analyze

1427
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,980
what they're looking at and their goals

1428
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,720
and then explain other areas you think

1429
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,680
that might be helpful to them because

1430
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,020
they're going to pen test the last

1431
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,910
consulting company I worked at we

1432
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:39,579
perform a pen test we'd even go back on

1433
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:42,098
a report and recommend other areas so

1434
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:43,300
say like we saw people tailgating into a

1435
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:44,980
company and they

1436
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,160
getting an easy than you might recommend

1437
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:49,420
like a physical security assessment and

1438
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,779
then also to like when you're delivering

1439
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:55,120
your reports is make sure you know to

1440
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:57,190
protect yourself make sure on your

1441
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,210
report you really have all the

1442
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,270
vulnerabilities especially if they're

1443
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,190
really critical you know sit down and

1444
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,810
look at it and make sure you ready to

1445
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:08,200
prepare to tell them the risks and

1446
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:10,450
defend those certain exploits because

1447
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,100
some people will get some people get

1448
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,210
offended and it's sometimes like you

1449
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,100
know you're telling someone their baby

1450
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,530
is ugly because this system an

1451
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:20,440
administrator you know they put in their

1452
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:21,940
time you know patching updating thinking

1453
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,230
they're doing the right thing but maybe

1454
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,240
they miss something maybe they missed

1455
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:27,370
something somewhere and so be able to do

1456
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,450
in a non-confrontational way let them

1457
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,890
know you're on the same team we're

1458
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,180
trying to help you out we're not trying

1459
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:33,190
to make you look bad we're trying to

1460
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,299
help you out so explain those kind of

1461
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,580
things and then when you're writing your

1462
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,080
executive report make sure you explain

1463
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,750
those in terms that management can

1464
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:43,110
understand that's easy for them to

1465
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:46,810
understand and maybe some other areas of

1466
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:49,570
IT that maybe they're the some of the

1467
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:51,070
different development groups or sysadmin

1468
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:53,620
groups maybe I understand stuff to write

1469
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,390
it where it's understandable give lots

1470
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:57,490
of documentation when you exploit

1471
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:58,810
something give a lot of details so they

1472
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:03,040
can almost look at it and go back and

1473
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:05,700
replicate the steps so what else

1474
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,700
yes

1475
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,618
it could happen that's kind of one of

1476
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:22,549
things that kind of scares me because

1477
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:25,289
you know pen testing is not cheap and I

1478
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:27,329
guess a lot of it I'm not sure how the

1479
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:29,130
laws work with some of those things but

1480
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:31,380
yeah I can see that could very well

1481
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:33,630
happen like a lot of other areas that

1482
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,799
are being outsourced because pen tests

1483
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,569
you don't have to be on site there's

1484
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,849
different ways someone could set up a

1485
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:41,549
jump box there's there's tools out there

1486
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:43,680
like Telus plate which is a company that

1487
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:45,630
sends out pen test boxes for companies

1488
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,299
and they just plug it in and you do an

1489
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:49,640
internal pen test remotely so there's if

1490
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:52,079
that could be done I just don't know if

1491
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,308
it seems like some areas of security

1492
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,619
they've been kind of hesitant to

1493
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:56,940
outsource and it really seems like

1494
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:59,520
they've been kind of hesitant to

1495
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,200
outsource some of that but I could see

1496
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,839
where companies could actually have

1497
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,419
people offshore performing the test then

1498
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,890
the customer really wouldn't know but

1499
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,200
that would be kind of deceitful

1500
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:13,200
practices because someone in another

1501
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,109
country and with private information or

1502
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,089
sensitive information on their computers

1503
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:20,160
and that could you know could be a

1504
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:21,750
problem so I think it get as far as

1505
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,220
logistical ii could it happen I see it

1506
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,260
could and the way people like to

1507
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,240
outsource I think if people can't get

1508
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,640
away with management you know a lot of

1509
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,399
times like to Alice more stuff I I see

1510
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:39,140
the possibility for it and it can be

1511
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:39,140
done for sure it was yes

1512
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:49,160
yes I actually I do and a couple really

1513
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:52,009
good resources is elearn security has a

1514
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,930
mobile pen testing course it does a lot

1515
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:59,350
of stuff we're reversing and the app

1516
00:58:53,930 --> 00:59:03,890
side and then also there is a company a

1517
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:06,589
defy they have like a web app pen

1518
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:08,480
testing course it's available download

1519
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:11,900
online you can download it and they

1520
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,310
actually go through you can run they got

1521
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,260
labs for it and stuff too so that

1522
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:17,779
wouldn't be going out of the a defy when

1523
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:21,200
they do a lot of IOT stuff they usually

1524
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:22,610
have a booth at DEFCON and they do a lot

1525
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,020
of they were one of the first ones to do

1526
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:26,270
IOT training that they've got a pretty

1527
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:30,200
good course that I took that's and it's

1528
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:32,210
it covers iOS and Android both so both

1529
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,350
of those courses I think it's just a

1530
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,470
defi net

1531
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:38,420
I think it's indeed a Gupta that is the

1532
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,009
he does a lot of conferences it writes

1533
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,840
this content and owns that company

1534
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,980
they've got a lot of good IOT pen

1535
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,900
testing kits too so if you're ever

1536
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,310
interested in IOT they actually have all

1537
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,510
the hardware and they got little

1538
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:51,049
different levels like it's with that

1539
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:52,780
with the the mobile pen testing you just

1540
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,890
if you're going to do some of the Apple

1541
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,750
testing you have to have advice to test

1542
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:58,250
with but you can still go through the

1543
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,410
course as far as the Android you can use

1544
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,670
simulators but that one or that you

1545
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:05,089
learn is security when I would check out

1546
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:07,580
the the one for edify I think is like

1547
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:14,620
700 bucks or something like that so it's

1548
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:14,620
even less than any other course yes

1549
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:43,170
okay yeah I would check out the P tez

1550
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:46,049
standard pts I forget the exact name for

1551
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:50,010
the site but if you if you type in PT s

1552
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:51,510
PT es like pen testing standard that'll

1553
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:53,730
come up but it's it's really nice and

1554
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:57,120
detailed because they cover pen tests

1555
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:58,890
from scoping the pre engagement meetings

1556
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,290
and all that stuff down to writing

1557
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:03,330
reports and different steps and it's

1558
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,880
kind of interesting for the report

1559
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:08,750
writing tool greatest they've got their

1560
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,160
community version and one of the the

1561
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:13,920
plugins they have is for doing standards

1562
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,450
and they give you the P tez checklist so

1563
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,490
as you go through writing your reports

1564
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:19,109
the tough thing about reports it's hard

1565
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:21,209
to find really good examples online

1566
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:22,950
because even for my class I had to kind

1567
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,570
of just come up with something at the

1568
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,640
time because no one you know a lot of

1569
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:28,040
companies it's their their secret

1570
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,089
they're not just gonna put their their

1571
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,200
reports out there but it's hard to find

1572
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,300
stuff and that's where stuff like

1573
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,399
greatest is good for writing reports

1574
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:38,580
with because it's a report generator and

1575
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,200
it's free there's also a professional

1576
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,569
version of it and then there's also a

1577
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,210
company called attack Forge they've got

1578
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:46,890
a tool you can't import your

1579
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,750
vulnerabilities but you can go through

1580
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:50,370
and write the report with it but I think

1581
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,480
like going through that PETA standard

1582
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,680
and just kind of looking at the

1583
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,050
different areas and they kind of tell

1584
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,520
you about report writing and stuff but

1585
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,810
yeah when you're doing your executive

1586
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,360
summary that's the one that you're just

1587
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:03,240
really general not technical as you get

1588
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:05,220
into the the the vulnerabilities and all

1589
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,049
that stuff and you get more technical as

1590
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:09,029
far as that goes and of course you know

1591
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:11,220
make it a language that you know assists

1592
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:13,830
admin or a developer would understand

1593
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:16,680
you know not so much the pen testing

1594
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:19,680
slaying so state you know use wording

1595
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,299
that they can understand and just the

1596
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,009
more you document more information you

1597
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,090
give them on there the better the less

1598
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,230
they have to come back and ask you

1599
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:31,470
questions the better

1600
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:36,619
you and veterans for them yes greatest

1601
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:38,520
greatest Drad is the greatest framework

1602
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:40,020
and it's pretty interesting too for

1603
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,470
anyone doing though SCP they actually

1604
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:45,420
have a no SDP report template one of my

1605
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:47,790
student system X semester actually set

1606
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:49,619
it up to write his report with and I

1607
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:51,359
used it last year for a side pin test I

1608
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:53,100
was doing I use the the commercial

1609
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,869
version but the nice thing about

1610
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,640
greatest compared to attack for if you

1611
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:58,859
can actually import necess input

1612
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,759
important so you can import necess and

1613
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:03,960
map burps we zap all the major tools and

1614
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,150
open the source tools out there you can

1615
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,500
import it something like attack Forge if

1616
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:10,530
you're doing a lot of manual testing and

1617
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,700
and it's hard to automate your report

1618
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:13,020
writing that one would be good because

1619
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,259
it's free and I think for their

1620
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:18,960
professional is $600 a year whereas

1621
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:22,250
greatests I think is like 70 bucks a

1622
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,250
month for the pro or something like that

1623
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,390
but the nice thing if you get the pro

1624
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,220
version the greatest then you get a VM

1625
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:31,109
to download it pre configure it if you

1626
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:33,270
use the greatest framework the free

1627
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:34,980
version then you're having to download

1628
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:37,320
and install it and set it up so there's

1629
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:40,590
a little more work there to get it up

1630
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,340
the right but it's nice because you go

1631
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,690
through there and it's a good

1632
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:45,570
collaboration tool so you're working

1633
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,950
with other other consultants they can go

1634
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,270
through and add their findings because

1635
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,850
one things we find we're out we're using

1636
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:53,690
currently we use just like a report

1637
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:56,040
generator that's an executable and so

1638
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:57,810
once the word documents that you sent

1639
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,310
over to the other person they're

1640
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:02,040
entering their information then you have

1641
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:04,259
to go through afterwards and and edit

1642
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,759
the report whereas with greatest you can

1643
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,720
be both working in the same report at

1644
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:14,119
the same time so it's a good

1645
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:14,118
collaboration tool as well anyone else

1646
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:22,930
greatest Drad is grief and it was like

1647
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,880
one of the first report writing tools

1648
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:26,470
out there there's some other ones that

1649
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:32,200
come out that I've heard good things

1650
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:34,569
about there's several men Kali Linux -

1651
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,720
no trying one of the kind of excuse me

1652
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:42,400
Serpico is one that I know from from

1653
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,328
Dallas tinker sack he likes that one so

1654
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,099
they're kind of good the nice thing is

1655
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:46,660
they're just not yet it's hard to find

1656
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:48,970
pin testing report templates out there

1657
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,828
so something like that is it helps

1658
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:57,009
because most companies that turn it or

1659
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:59,130
write their own report generator anyone

1660
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:59,130
else

1661
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:15,260
yeah you can if it helps to know some

1662
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:17,660
Python scripting in that but you don't

1663
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:19,970
have to have it and as far as the DEP

1664
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:22,129
that goes into you actually have to

1665
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:26,270
modify an exploit so there's like a

1666
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:27,680
buffer overflow in in the exam lab and

1667
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:31,490
you have to be able to exploit that

1668
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,569
so you find there's like existing code

1669
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:34,339
out there but you have to go through

1670
01:05:32,569 --> 01:05:36,290
modify to make it work for me that was

1671
01:05:34,339 --> 01:05:37,730
the hardest part because I don't have

1672
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:39,980
the development and coding background

1673
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:42,020
you know the other stuff was not as

1674
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,730
difficult for me but it's a very

1675
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:45,259
difficult test you you learn a lot from

1676
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,640
it if you don't have experience in that

1677
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:48,559
area then I would start prepping up

1678
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,259
front because once you sign up for the

1679
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:54,260
OS CP your time starts ticking so if it

1680
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:57,380
takes you you know get through the book

1681
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:59,540
and to get through the videos then you

1682
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:01,040
burn up a month of your lab time and so

1683
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:03,470
you need to spend time hacking those

1684
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:06,290
devices to to get the experience to be

1685
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:07,609
able to pass the exam and for I've seen

1686
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,770
the people have been most successful

1687
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:11,630
have went through and hacked every

1688
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:13,009
target within the lab because the thing

1689
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:16,180
is you know how that you gotta know how

1690
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:19,790
to hack so it's like the one european

1691
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:20,328
student that what the hack the box for

1692
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:22,549
like a year

1693
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:25,089
just hammer away to hacking and there's

1694
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:28,609
some resources out there on different

1695
01:06:25,089 --> 01:06:30,619
via different virtual machines and hack

1696
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:32,750
the box that are more like stuff in the

1697
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:35,230
OS CP so there's some good guides out

1698
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,230
there for that

1699
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:49,170
virtual hacking Labs is good they've got

1700
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:51,840
a good lap there and then hack the box a

1701
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:53,340
lot of people use that so just

1702
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,390
understanding that because you know you

1703
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:59,700
can go through some of these free

1704
01:06:54,390 --> 01:07:02,549
resources like the let's see the hacker

1705
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:04,710
will see the free resource the hacking

1706
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:06,630
tutorials org go through there learn I

1707
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:08,370
mean one of the best steps I'd say for

1708
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:10,560
anyone is to learn in map go through and

1709
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:11,970
and go through in map cheat sheets learn

1710
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,100
how to use in map thoroughly that's

1711
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:15,330
gonna be a big step right there be able

1712
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,250
to how to do your scans because a lot of

1713
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,180
times people make the mistake when

1714
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:20,310
they're going through that they don't

1715
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:22,799
scan all 65k ports so there may be

1716
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:25,020
something on a normally not used port

1717
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:29,220
and so going through there to learn how

1718
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:31,380
to do your scans more efficiently is a

1719
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:33,359
big help and then just learning how to

1720
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,440
use a variety of tools where you go

1721
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,630
through that don't depend on just one

1722
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,820
tool even professionally pentesting i've

1723
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:40,800
found stuff with like nikto which is web

1724
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:43,110
app application scanner that's command

1725
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,660
line and i've found stuff with it that I

1726
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:47,340
couldn't find with nessus a commercial

1727
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,649
tool so I just learned how to use all

1728
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:52,370
the tools and and then also look at the

1729
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:54,930
wet you know don't look at just you know

1730
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:56,670
the network layer look at applications

1731
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,190
because lot of times some of the

1732
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:00,690
application some of the the vulnerable

1733
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:02,880
servers are easier to get down through

1734
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:06,080
maybe an application so kind of get a

1735
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,080
good understanding of that to you

1736
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,089
yes typically they're gonna have some

1737
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:21,009
kind of port open yeah you're gonna have

1738
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:21,970
to have one at least 1 port open to get

1739
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:24,040
in there unless you had physical access

1740
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:30,810
to it so I usually have something open

1741
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:30,810
on there yes

1742
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:44,899
I think my preference is Nessa Stein

1743
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:46,700
open vas is a little more cumbersome and

1744
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:49,250
it's a little less intuitive

1745
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,300
necess you know you got it set up and

1746
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,750
you get in there it's pretty easy to

1747
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,420
figure out

1748
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:56,000
open bosses a little more a little more

1749
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:58,640
difficult to learn and it's interesting

1750
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,170
because it's like a a fork of an older

1751
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,060
version of necess so they took like an

1752
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:04,520
older so the older code and they've

1753
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:06,200
developed it into like their own I've

1754
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,850
seen some consulting companies that will

1755
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,519
actually go in they'll run SS and run

1756
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:11,870
open vas to run multiple vulnerability

1757
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,670
scanners against the system because

1758
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:15,500
sometimes you can catch things the other

1759
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:19,580
tool of mine I've done pen tests where

1760
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:21,109
companies were using rapid7 Expos and I

1761
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,569
found something that they weren't able

1762
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:25,460
to find with Nessus so if you can run

1763
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:28,219
multiple vulnerability scanners that's a

1764
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:30,380
good thing and then depending doing some

1765
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,600
good manual testing like using in map

1766
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:40,000
and a lot of in map scripts you can do

1767
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:40,000
pretty well with us yes

1768
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:49,519
yeah they're real helpful I use most of

1769
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:51,969
my validation on a pen test when I look

1770
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,320
at the vulnerabilities from the the

1771
01:09:51,969 --> 01:09:57,440
nessus can I'll go through and I'll use

1772
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,840
necess scripts to do validation there's

1773
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:03,199
some stuff that will check for anonymous

1774
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:05,630
FTP there's like an FTP bounce attack

1775
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,369
were you able to go through one server

1776
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:08,659
to another and you test with that

1777
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:12,230
there's a special script for that

1778
01:10:08,659 --> 01:10:14,420
there's a lot of stuff to test for SSL

1779
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,769
TLS and the different ciphers and stuff

1780
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,840
there's a lot of stuff there so a lot of

1781
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:21,290
the testing I do there I mainly go

1782
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,059
between that and SSL scan SSL ice to

1783
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:25,190
test anything related to certificates

1784
01:10:23,059 --> 01:10:26,570
and encryption so there's a lot of

1785
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,888
different ones there's like a whole page

1786
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:30,320
on their scripts and there's a nice one

1787
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:31,969
too for my for my favorite when it's the

1788
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,849
bull script so when you're doing your

1789
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:37,520
end map scans you can tie it you can use

1790
01:10:34,849 --> 01:10:38,659
the bone and just bul in that bolus grip

1791
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,040
will actually go through find

1792
01:10:38,659 --> 01:10:43,519
vulnerabilities and give you like the

1793
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,440
CVEs and the open source database

1794
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,270
numbers for that and so you can get more

1795
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,650
detail and phone abilities so it's kind

1796
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:51,199
of a way to do vulnerability scanning

1797
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:52,369
without using a vulnerability scanner so

1798
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,690
that's something you could probably use

1799
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:55,639
like in the OS CP because they don't

1800
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,928
allow vulnerability scanners but you

1801
01:10:55,639 --> 01:11:00,110
could use something like that nessus

1802
01:10:56,929 --> 01:11:01,400
crypt so that's one of my favorites but

1803
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:04,909
just look on there they've got all sorts

1804
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:07,400
of stuff where SMB SNMP and just like

1805
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:08,780
going through the OS DP SNMP is one area

1806
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,040
that people overlook a lot of times but

1807
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:12,949
SNMP can give you a lot of information

1808
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,440
like applications installed user

1809
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:16,400
accounts and all sorts of stuff so

1810
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,769
that's one of the interesting is about

1811
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,019
the OS CP they really or at least when I

1812
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:22,369
went through they covered the SNMP stuff

1813
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:25,429
a lot so there's some things you can

1814
01:11:22,369 --> 01:11:27,110
find there so just the more you can more

1815
01:11:25,429 --> 01:11:28,489
information you can pull from that

1816
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:31,280
system you take it from being a black

1817
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:32,869
box to you to to more of more go towards

1818
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,889
the white box of Crystal box the more

1819
01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:35,889
information you have on it

1820
01:11:41,809 --> 01:11:44,440
yes

1821
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:49,920
yeah

1822
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,150
it's something I've been working on

1823
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:59,848
Python for a while I just need to get

1824
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:01,650
down and start writing some projects and

1825
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:04,230
stuff but the main thing is when you're

1826
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:07,230
pen tester knowing if you can modify the

1827
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:09,058
scripts that's a good that's will help a

1828
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:10,980
lot I mean I got by four years without

1829
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:12,420
scripting but it's like be able to

1830
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:15,058
modify code one of the things I learned

1831
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,469
to the OS CP is there's some C code that

1832
01:12:15,059 --> 01:12:18,119
you actually have to compile on so I'd

1833
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:19,559
have to go through and edit that and

1834
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:21,659
sometimes the vulnerability is the

1835
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:23,309
formatting when you download it to try

1836
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:24,980
to compile it sometimes it doesn't work

1837
01:12:23,309 --> 01:12:27,570
and you have to go through and adjust

1838
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:29,129
indentions and the syntax the different

1839
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:29,790
code in there to get it to compile

1840
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:32,099
correctly

1841
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:33,449
but if you're gonna learn a script I

1842
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:35,489
would start with Python because there's

1843
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:37,589
so many libraries out there for pen

1844
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:39,570
testing and security Perl used to be the

1845
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:41,250
tool but there's so many and there's a

1846
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:43,909
lot of good pen testing tools written

1847
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,909
Python to you

1848
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:58,519
well no one else has any questions oh

1849
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,518
yes

1850
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:08,550
okay

1851
01:13:09,269 --> 01:13:11,840
yeah

1852
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:21,710
yeah good for Dropbox's I got a

1853
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:23,120
Raspberry Pi it's been 3 or 4 years ago

1854
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:25,070
and before I got it to install Kali

1855
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,210
Linux on it and it's pretty cool

1856
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,620
because you know you can buy some of

1857
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:29,450
those other drop boxes but you don't

1858
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,940
want to go off and leave those you spend

1859
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:33,170
100 or hundreds of dollars on a drop box

1860
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,750
you don't want to leave it somewhere not

1861
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:37,490
bill get it back so and then you get

1862
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:40,460
some of the smaller form factors like

1863
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:43,010
the the nanos or whatever then you can

1864
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:44,390
even hide those and stuff a bit more one

1865
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:46,430
of the guys from our local community did

1866
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:48,380
a ride up a while back because he took

1867
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:50,930
like a power supply for like a copy or

1868
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:53,060
something and put a Raspberry Pi in it

1869
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:54,770
and set up as a drop box and then you

1870
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:56,840
had all the the ports like for the surge

1871
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:59,000
protection for a thorough net and stuff

1872
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:05,330
so you can actually plug in there and so

1873
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:06,710
you can do some pretty cool stuff ok if

1874
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:08,059
no one else has any questions that we're

1875
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:20,260
going to end it here and I'm available

1876
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:20,260
for questions outside here too so thanks
