1
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,780
I'm talking forever but I made it fun so

2
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,328
if you pay attention you might get

3
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,250
prizes then we're gonna go into the

4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,320
brain because I'm obsessed with the

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,329
brain so you can learn a little bit

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,150
about how your brain works when it comes

7
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:48,250
to gaming and then why gamification

8
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,390
helps security teams and as well as how

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,550
gamification is transform lives

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,400
so while gamification is basically the

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,110
games that work on problem solving

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,440
processing speed attention span and

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,629
memory and now let's dive into the

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,840
history you guys ready for this you

15
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:11,289
gotta pay attention all right and for 25

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,550
BC a dice games were created to fight

17
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:17,820
major famine and in 3100 BC first board

18
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,679
game was created in Egypt

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,320
S&H Green stamp was the first time ever

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,210
marketers sold stamps to retailers that

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,898
if the customer returns they get a

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,280
discount and in 1958 the first video

23
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:34,780
game was invented and Charles Cora

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,820
founded a consulting firm called that

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,150
game of work and it brings feedback

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:44,949
loops found in sports into the workplace

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,810
and mu d1 is created by Roy at Essex

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,380
University it was the first multi-user

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,659
virtual world game Thomas Malone

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,149
publishes what makes things fun to learn

31
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:58,360
a study of interestingly motivating

32
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,810
computer games and in 1981 the first

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,740
ever 3d video games were released

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,509
American Airlines

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,970
actually introduces the very first

36
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,399
frequent flyer program and as aid

37
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,340
advantage and how they launched their

38
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,890
first royalty program as well natural

39
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,829
car rental did followed the first car

40
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,779
rental rewards program and 30% of

41
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:22,600
American households now actually owned

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,510
in NES a new generation of gamers is now

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,810
officially born and Richard Bartle

44
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,700
publishes who plays mu ace which divides

45
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,250
video game players into four unique

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,369
types

47
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,750

ready for the next part all right in

69
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,450
2002 series Damien issues forages a link

70
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,090
between the gaming industry and training

71
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:57,000
health education and public policy and

72
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,380
in 2003 Nick pelling coins the term

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,200
gamification a 2007 bunch ball created

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,299
dunder-mifflin infinity it's actually a

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,399
game of fide website for the TV show the

76
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,330
office and it receives over 8 million

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,830
pageviews within six weeks 2009 quest to

78
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,989
learn accepts a class of sixth graders

79
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:20,489
into a game based learning environment

80
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,650
and in 2010 dev hog adds a point system

81
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:27,419
to its website and increases user

82
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,460
engagement by 70% 2010 gamification co

83
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,990
holds the first gamification summit in

84
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,710
San Francisco

85
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,470
in 2012 45,000 enroll and a professor

86
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,580
kevin online gamification course through

87
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,410
Coursera and 2012 Mozilla opens badges

88
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,909
initiative is launched and the open

89
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,450
source badges can be used to mark

90
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,760
accomplishments online 2012 gartner

91
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,800
predicts 70% of the global 2000

92
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,539
organizations will have at least one

93
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,370
gamified application of by 2014 and 2014

94
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,850
m2 research predicts that gamification

95
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,020
will be a 2.8 billion dollar industry by

96
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,210
2016

97
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,130
which is true and it actually went

98
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,500
beyond that and is expected to be about

99
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:18,130
11 billion dollar industry by 2020 you

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:24,940
guys ready again let's do this kou-kun

101
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:29,560
the term gamification that would be Nick

102
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,810
pelling next one what was the gamified

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,720
website by bunch ball for the TV show

104
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:43,570
The Office called

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:49,060
yes yep KitKat erases all right is that

106
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:51,310
racist okay next one gamification is

107
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:56,080
expected to become a blank billion

108
00:05:51,310 --> 00:06:04,150
dollar industry by 2020 yes yep

109
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:08,159
Reese's or KitKat yeah so that is the

110
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:10,750
end of the pop quiz or is it not

111
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,650
hoi Missy but let's just dive right back

112
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,240
into the presentation right now

113
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:20,020
true fact though is InfoSec has always

114
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,890
been gamified think about it we do CTFs

115
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:28,240
we do bug bounty we do hackathons so

116
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:31,570
it's always existed and that's why even

117
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,580
now we have a time line and so in 1995

118
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,650
Netscape launched the first-ever bug

119
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,550
bounty program known to man and the

120
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,799
first DEFCON CTF was actually in 1996

121
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,920
and both battery programs were actually

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,420
created and managed

123
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,300
companies such as Google and Facebook

124
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:51,230
and Mozilla and ponchione started in

125
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,720
2007 and last but not least the bug

126
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,670
bounty programs themselves like those

127
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,420
platforms actually started coming around

128
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,070
in 2012-2013 and for the first time ever

129
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:05,060
companies didn't have to manage their

130
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:07,310
own so yeah there's more

131
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,370
about pop quiz here you guys ready next

132
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,540
round the first bug body program was

133
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,540
created in what year Yeah right

134
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:29,030
recess or kick at recess when was the

135
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:33,130
first CTF at DEFCON who was it

136
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:42,080
I think it was a guy with a red coat

137
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:44,330
correct recess or kick at kick it what

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:57,969
are the three major bug bounty companies

139
00:07:44,330 --> 00:08:06,010
in the order of creation go found close

140
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:12,190
anyone else want to go to go yes mmm

141
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:14,480
close very close yeah we could do that

142
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:19,300
all right you just say it's buck hot

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,380
hacker one instant acts so close okay

144
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:26,960
all right now we're gonna dive into the

145
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:29,300
brains so first things first we're gonna

146
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,729
dive in and get to know your brain and

147
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,640
the cushions that I asked was actually

148
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:37,580
focused on that green part of your brain

149
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,020
that's it whatever way you're liking the

150
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,850
green part which is the temporal lobe

151
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,340
and in the temporal lobe if you see this

152
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,080
where the amygdala and hippocampus is

153
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,460
stored and this is the part that's

154
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,060
activated the most when it comes to

155
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:52,640
gamification so the temporal lobe is

156
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,219
involved in processing sensory input

157
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,319
into drive minis

158
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,270
appropriate tension a visual memory

159
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
language comprehension and emotion

160
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,680
association is where gamification

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,730
thrives and where the amygdala and

162
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,130
hippocampus are but believe it or not

163
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,710
this is the part that if you are a good

164
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,810
hacker or you work in InfoSec this parts

165
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,470
always lit up the most than any other

166
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,989
part of your brain probably so if we're

167
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,600
gonna do an activity now I'm gonna

168
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,920
basically say a line and you're gonna

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,830
shout out what is that word okay

170
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,250
sound good okay let's do this

171
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,380
a plant having a permanently woody main

172
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,630
stem usually growing to a high height

173
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:43,200
and developing branches at some distance

174
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:46,780
from the ground you shout out the answer

175
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,490
tree correct the nutritious orange to

176
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:53,680
yellow root of a plant of the parsley

177
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:55,570
family good job an article furniture

178
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,829
consisting of a flat top supported on

179
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:04,000
one or more legs table an institution

180
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:06,340
where instruction is given mm-hmm a

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,090
moving cage for carrying passengers from

182
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,190
one level to another good job a device

183
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:16,630
for transmission of sound or speech to a

184
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:22,270
distant point I don't always thinks

185
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:24,840
radio phone a body of water of

186
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:28,810
considerable size surrounded by land

187
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:32,800
like a domestic fowl bred for its flesh

188
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:37,199
eggs and feathers a shallow usually

189
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,199
circular dish from which food is eaten a

190
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,430
precipitation in the form of ice

191
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:49,500
crystals snow I wish it was ice cream

192
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:53,819
any sickly medium of exchange

193
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,670
money so if you sohow the temporal lobe

194
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,670
works is that you are taught in a sense

195
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,860
like this word has this visual so

196
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,719
whenever someone reads a description an

197
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,930
image comes to your head and then you

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,490
put a word to it so in the temporal lobe

199
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,620
that's where that happens is where the

200
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,810
visuals are therefore the visual cues to

201
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,330
understand the description to put an

202
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,670
actual image on it and a lot is audible

203
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:22,380
and also it could be anything that's

204
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:28,560
written so like I said we're gonna focus

205
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:30,689
now and amygdala and the hippocampus so

206
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,479
what is the hippocampus it's basically a

207
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,940
short-term memories are transform food

208
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,460
to long-term memories that are found in

209
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,840
temporal lobe so our conscious memories

210
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,030
are actually formed in the hippocampus

211
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,130
taking a snapshot of a short-term

212
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:49,020
working memory and commit to a long-term

213
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:51,270
and restore it in the temporal lobes and

214
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,069
yes there's another activity all right

215
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:57,079
now you got to pay attention to the

216
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:00,000
screens here everyone ready

217
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,480
take a note illicit items I want you to

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,920
read it once then twice and when you're

219
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,920
done look up here

220
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:33,060
okay next up I'm gonna ask you to take

221
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,529
out your phone so take out your phone

222
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,890

223
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:38,910
to take out your phone at a talk

224
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:45,720
congratulations

225
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:48,689
next step you ready I want you to like

226
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,980
basically get your notes out or draft an

227
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,480
email

228
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,890
you're never gonna sign it trust me

229
00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:02,550
you'll be fine everyone has that raise

230
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:06,089
your hand hands up when you got it just

231
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:14,880
keep them up and one's got notes drafts

232
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:17,730
open all right cool now you have two

233
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:24,680
minutes to try to write all that list in

234
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:24,680
at the same order two minutes go

235
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:53,300
you have about one more minute remember

236
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:56,199
it has to be an order - you have 30

237
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,199
seconds now

238
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,670
all right

239
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:28,139
phones down hands both hands up that's

240
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,079
right you're under arrest now just

241
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:33,540
kidding

242
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,819
all right no changes can happen and

243
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,300
everyone make sure no one makes changes

244
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:41,969
okay you hold each other accountable how

245
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:52,170
many of you guys got the 10 in the right

246
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:54,240
order raise your hand anyone and you

247
00:15:52,170 --> 00:16:04,378
won't even got Ted did anyone get 10 of

248
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:11,699
them correct nice and did you do it in

249
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:13,139
the same order or you'd like I would

250
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:18,120
give you something for that you want to

251
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:20,990
kick at our rhesus races and did you do

252
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,839
that because you came up with a story

253
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,759
see that is a trick ladies and gentlemen

254
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,639
how you do it is you make a story out of

255
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,870
it so the ones are like incredibly

256
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,300
professional they do this for our sport

257
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,430
and further living they'll come up with

258
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,589
a story for example I was walking in

259
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:41,069
London with an umbrella and my shoe got

260
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:43,439
stuck because I saw this cuddly toy in

261
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:45,089
the store but then I saw right next to

262
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:47,430
it there was a shop and they were

263
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,559
selling a melon but then when I was

264
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,719
walking I actually ran into almost the

265
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,730
tree because I only slipped on some

266
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,500
yogurt that was on the street because I

267
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,540
was also distracted by that their

268
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,040
apparent just like flew by in London for

269
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,540
some strange reason and I'm just

270
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,839
thinking oh my God thank God because my

271
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,449
laptop would have broken if I fell and I

272
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,829
also would have ruined my red jumper but

273
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,929
then at the end of the day I'm like that

274
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:13,139
red jumper is okay but it just brings

275
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,730
back those basketball days so you can

276
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,500
come up with story like that and it

277
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,860
sticks in your head so the more odd you

278
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,199
make it the better its

279
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:22,359
six so if you throw in an octopus

280
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,500
somewhere on that story or anything like

281
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,520
that that's how you're gonna remember

282
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:31,420
these things so give me the modules such

283
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,760
as gamification that shows that you know

284
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,530
problem solving on time or what not but

285
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,929
the thing is if you want to improve your

286
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,240
hippocampus your short-term memory to go

287
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,890
into long-term memory doing crossword

288
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,600
puzzles work really well and taking a

289
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,160
new route home so you don't use the same

290
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,330
one over and over just walk a different

291
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,820
way and gaming modules and the thing is

292
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,520
to know is about that particular one

293
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,100
that we just did there was timing

294
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,480
involved so that makes you anxious and

295
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,100
if you are a red teamer or yeah pretty

296
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,470
much your red team or you're doing buy

297
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,830
bounties or you're at a hackathon or CTF

298
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:12,250
timing is its essence and that is where

299
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,470
you thrive so anyone here have anxiety I

300
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,260
do so I'm just gonna raise my hand

301
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,809
awesome so if you had anxiety chances

302
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,910
are you're always like always stimulate

303
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:24,040
in this particular region the amygdala

304
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,110
which is an almond-shaped part of your

305
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,440
brain which is the fight versus fight

306
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,719
mechanism basically it's very socially

307
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,100
constructed for example if someone told

308
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,820
me okay no one has pink hair in here

309
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,678
right okay so if someone said to you be

310
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,600
careful if someone would pink hair

311
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,740
they're dangerous people what you're

312
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,178
gonna do is when you see someone with

313
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,070
pink hair you're gonna run to the other

314
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,540
side of street you're gonna do whatever

315
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,040
you can to avoid that person because you

316
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,320
were told at a very young age to be

317
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,950
afraid so your amygdala is constantly on

318
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,580
one it has a they see a threat but also

319
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,110
timing is one of those things you know

320
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,840
should say it's completely unconscious

321
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,120
so no time you can actually like try to

322
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,070
train it to go down is when you question

323
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,939
it and your prefrontal cortex or any

324
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,860
time you're in Magdala is like oh my god

325
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,480
it goes right to your head

326
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,309
your prefrontal cortex in the frontal

327
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,620
brain actually turns around it's like

328
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:20,139
you need to chill out because you

329
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,520
question it and this is a messages back

330
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:26,400
to the amygdala and say calm down or

331
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,170
fight-or-flight

332
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:35,370
all right here comes the activity

333
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:37,500
everyone ready and if you are scared

334
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,270
well I'm not even go there

335
00:19:37,500 --> 00:20:13,680
so there's two parts to this so the

336
00:19:39,270 --> 00:20:16,889
first part let's do this who saw the

337
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,220
keys and shoes the first time has anyone

338
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,420
actually seen this video before okay all

339
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,370
right you ready for the next one for

340
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,540
those that didn't see the keys and shoes

341
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,540
here you go

342
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,100
you don't need listen to him I'll just

343
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,900
tell you I remember that thing I told

344
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,760
you about socially constructive beliefs

345
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,740
at a young age you're told to be afraid

346
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,970
of spiders or snakes and maybe you

347
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,590
weren't told but you actually in the

348
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,880
media you saw maybe these people are

349
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,350
scared of spiders and snakes they're

350
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,200
like oh I should probably be scared of

351
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,360
these spiders and snakes so that is when

352
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,480
your amygdala is hitting really hard

353
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,490
it's like oh my god freeze if anyone's

354
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,070
been in a car accident who's been in a

355
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,450
car accident okay so I don't know if

356
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,010
you've experienced this is where

357
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,640
suddenly it feels like everything just

358
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:32,530
slow down really slow in that moment and

359
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,410
the reason for that is because you're on

360
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:37,360
high alert you're in survival mode

361
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:40,150
completely it's and that's called

362
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,490
amygdala hijack I actually believe it or

363
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,610
not so that is how it is so when you saw

364
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,630
the spiders and those snakes it seemed

365
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:53,790
like it was slower for some reason right

366
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:56,560
interesting right yeah that's it okay so

367
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,360
how does gamification actually help

368
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,090
security teams not only does it help

369
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,699
when it comes to your reflexes but also

370
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,980
you learn these things and you put it

371
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,960
into good usage and not just that but

372
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,080
certifications are not enough anymore

373
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,090
and too we need to always be aware of

374
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,669
everything at all times and the new

375
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:18,070
trends and then we also burnout we have

376
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,540
lack of team members as well on our team

377
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,790
and that leaves us up for a huge

378
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,920
security risk I mean how many you guys

379
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:28,570
actually experienced a storage on your

380
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,550
security team yeah it's hard because you

381
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,740
have to wear multiple different hats and

382
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,720
you have to do a lot more and that's why

383
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,850
it's really needed more than ever to do

384
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,100
gamification so then you can learn new

385
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,840
skills really fast and retain it really

386
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,550
fast in an effective way because if I

387
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,429
were to be the up here for talking for

388
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,230
four hours of

389
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,540
something you're not gonna pick up

390
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,090
majority of that you might pick up 10 to

391
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,620
20% of that at most so that's why it's

392
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,600
important to actually do something where

393
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,250
it constantly brings you back in so

394
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,610
every eight minutes you need something

395
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,950
new

396
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,570
you know why Family Guy's thrives it's

397
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,100
because it has those random moments

398
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,020
something you know he'll have a

399
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,850
conversation with someone and then a

400
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,580
chicken just comes busting in trying to

401
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,080
beat his ass so I mean and the kool-aid

402
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,600
guy as well so that's why it's so

403
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,389
successful is because people with a DD

404
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,280
and high anxiety you love that stuff

405
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,280
because it keeps you on your toes

406
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,090
so Gartner came out and about in 2020 I

407
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,860
don't have to read this can you guys

408
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,169
read it because I would totally read

409
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:34,340
this out loud but I don't have my

410
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:36,230
glasses either all right so now again

411
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:40,520
you're going to want to listen hint to

412
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:43,340
the facts here about so fact number one

413
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,070
96% of companies that adopt gamification

414
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,020
the workplace report seeing benefits

415
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,700
which is fantastic and that's four based

416
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,639
odd gamification exercise such as

417
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,370
hackathons capture the flag Red Team

418
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,790
Blue Team like Betty programs as well

419
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,830
and more than half 57% of response

420
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,480
actually reported that using game

421
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,179
increases awareness and IT staff

422
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,060
knowledge of how breaches can occur if

423
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,950
43 percent of gamification enforces team

424
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,399
work culture needed for a quick

425
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,840
effective cybersecurity in 77 percent of

426
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,910
senior managers agreed that their

427
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,959
organization would be safer if they use

428
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:23,330
more gamification and to address a

429
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,850
shortage in skilled cyber secure worker

430
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,889
the report also suggests that gamers

431
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,139
those engaged in immersed in online

432
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,480
competitions may be the logical next

433
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,610
step to plug the gap and believe it or

434
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,740
not that nearly 92 percent of

435
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,080
responsibility that gaming affords

436
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,330
players experience and skills crucial to

437
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,879
cyber security such as threat hunting

438
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,710
like logic perseverance and understand

439
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,510
how to approach adversaries and fresh

440
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,610
outlook compared to traditional cyber

441
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,040
security team that's why it more often

442
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,479
now when you're going for job interviews

443
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,480
to be on a red team

444
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,120
your future manager will ask you

445
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,350
questions do you play games and if

446
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,780
they're not they're gonna try to find

447
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,490
out social engineer you to find out now

448
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,960
and the reason for that is that they

449
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,860
would rather hire someone who does

450
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,600
gaming then does not do gaming because

451
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,629
it shows that you're effective you're

452
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,780
fast

453
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,400
and 77% of employees find game based

454
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,559
training to be more effective than

455
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,330
traditional training methods such as

456
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:28,668
gaming standing up here and giving you a

457
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:31,850
four hour lecture and the most important

458
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:34,100
thing is that not only does gamification

459
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,100
help so if you do like say for example

460
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,428
before you are employed you actually go

461
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,740
through an exercise and this gaming

462
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:45,559
module basically test out your speed

463
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,690
your strengths and your weaknesses this

464
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,790
is a game-changing moment to be honest

465
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,980
because I don't know about you ladies in

466
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,690
here for example sometimes when you

467
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,370
submit your resume you're worried that

468
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,860
they're gonna see your name and not call

469
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:02,239
you for the next interview because

470
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:04,010
biases do exist and so in a sense we

471
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,040
have noticed that when you do gaming

472
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,770
modules before being hired this is a

473
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,480
really good thing to note because what

474
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,600
ends up happening is the people that

475
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,980
they usually reject based on resumes and

476
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,809
because sometimes they just see

477
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,030
certifications like that person is

478
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,220
perfect but in reality they might not be

479
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,990
the best person on the team and for the

480
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,000
first time ever they're actually able to

481
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,460
see who's gonna do a better job in the

482
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,840
end and that's changing Dynamis because

483
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,419
now there's more women being hired

484
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,280
because of this and believe it or not

485
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,900
even when you're doing gaming modules

486
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,990
even when you're on your team so

487
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,309
sometimes companies they'll like hire

488
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,590
gamification modules to test out their

489
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,299
team find their weaknesses basically do

490
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,830
like some of them have like a Netflix

491
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:47,270
kind of thing where I set up where you

492
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,270
get to pick which ones you want to do

493
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:53,299
the courses and so those that do pretty

494
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:55,129
well on those or they they finally get

495
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:57,770
flagged and notice that they're actually

496
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,110
someone really good on the team and also

497
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:03,710
once again another interesting thing for

498
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,908
women allowed that time is the women are

499
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,039
in junior penthouses

500
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:09,349
positions and what happens is that they

501
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,450
go through this course and then they're

502
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:13,849
basically their manager sees their

503
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:18,109
talent and cannot believe that they

504
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:19,549
actually out beat them themselves and so

505
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:21,289
that's something to think about is that

506
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:26,809
this is a way to actually challenge

507
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:28,460
biases and also like I said we do have a

508
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:31,309
skills gap it's not just about

509
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,309
certifications anymore and not just that

510
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:37,460
we are all burned out in this industry

511
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:40,389
we burn out so fast because we don't we

512
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,919
have weird hours of sleep let's be real

513
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:44,629
and not just that we're always worried

514
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,970
about a breach and it will cost us our

515
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:49,609
job or our manager's job or someone's

516
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,039
job and that's why it's really important

517
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:53,299
to do type of gaming modules to make

518
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,029
sure that we're in the best shape

519
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:59,059
possible

520
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:02,119
and yes so if you can answer this

521
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:05,080
question I have a recess or kick effort

522
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:21,499
good for it huh

523
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:23,210
no 96 recess or kick at recess not only

524
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:26,149
that so I did share a little bit about

525
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,039
some statistics and everything but also

526
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:31,070
it's transform lives and remember when I

527
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,869
was talking about those biases I have

528
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,600
two stories that actually share these

529
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:37,510
kind of things

530
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,600
so one is Veronica Veronica was studying

531
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:42,100
computer science by accident but she was

532
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,709
actually planning to originally stay

533
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:47,289
Latin and Greek and she was also taking

534
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,120
computer science classes and she just

535
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,830
realized that that would probably better

536
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,830
for her and so when she graduates she

537
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,360
was like I'm in I don't want to do a PhD

538
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,370
so instead she went to youth development

539
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,559
and she did that for about five years

540
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,360
after graduating and she loved it but

541
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,668
didn't challenge her she wanted to be

542
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,969
kind of something that would inspire her

543
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:09,520
and power her and so one day she was she

544
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,700
saw like this ad with a partnership with

545
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,830
the DoD as a boot camp and they drew her

546
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,049
to it because they said on there we're

547
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:19,750
looking for problem-solving ability

548
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:22,299
being able to work on problems were a

549
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,780
long time and willingness to do

550
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:27,580
discipline - with your learning and

551
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,500
since she loves patterns and puzzles and

552
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,418
whatnot she started out with the reverse

553
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,730
engineering challenge with Escalade and

554
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:36,340
after she went to a consulting company

555
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:39,700
for about six months within InfoSec and

556
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,309
her tire was a technology consultant but

557
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,429
she really was a pen tester and so she

558
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:48,280
actually was approached by 0.3 because

559
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:52,299
she was scored the highest out of all

560
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,789
and so they brought her on and basically

561
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:56,770
now she works with us and but the thing

562
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:59,350
is important to know is that she never

563
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,668
said off to be a hacker she never knew

564
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,129
that that was something that was going

565
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:08,740
to be good for her until she realized

566
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:11,080
that from that boot camp Valentina

567
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,480
so Valentina she studied psychology it

568
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,309
wasn't a big fan of math but yet she

569
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,669
took a math class in college and she

570
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:20,678
realized she had this huge love for it

571
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:23,440
so she went to go school all to continue

572
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:25,330
to study math at UIC and she did an

573
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,039
internship at the physics department and

574
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,260
she had to basically learn some basic

575
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,970
coding and took a class in computer

576
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,220
science as well and afterwards she

577
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,679
worked as The Economist as the Federal

578
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,530
Reserve Bank she discovered a passion

579
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,360
for computers at that point because she

580
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,790
thought it would be so cool to tell a

581
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,729
computer what to do and I'll do it for

582
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,420
her

583
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:50,600
and she just thought I really also want

584
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,850
to learn a little bit more about what

585
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,490
else I can do with a computer so she

586
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,959
thought it would be really cool to

587
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,570
basically go into hacking and the reason

588
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,290
for that she saw the movie hackers who

589
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,970
seen hackers excellent so she thought it

590
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,070
was like really cool and so she was like

591
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,320
I really liked that early computer like

592
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,389
internet culture hacking community image

593
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,250
and it really attracted her to it but

594
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,020
she didn't know where to start and she

595
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,960
also thought like she always kept seeing

596
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,910
this image of you know any time you look

597
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:28,790
up hacker on Google Images what do you

598
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:32,330
get is facing cancer redbull rebels true

599
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:34,399
but I mean let's be real so she saw a

600
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,350
press release from Chicago it was for

601
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,560
the mayor actually posted saying that

602
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:42,290
they're looking for basically for anyone

603
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:46,100
who's interested in maybe being

604
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,750
recruited for the DoD and so she decided

605
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,600
she was gonna go and do this and she

606
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,270
applied and she got accepted so once

607
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,500
again this event was sponsored by

608
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,200
escalate and she had absolutely zero

609
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:00,550
experience beforehand and within three

610
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,840
months she knocked it out of everything

611
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,590
so within three months with no

612
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,260
experience

613
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,790
she actually realized that this is

614
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,160
something she was actually good at and

615
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:12,860
not just up but the instructors noticed

616
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,300
that she was way ahead of her time and

617
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,750
with the three months she was actually

618
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,250
recruited out of the six-month program

619
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,470
because she was that good and this was a

620
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,110
way to see these things and it's funny

621
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,400
because the like basically those that

622
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,010
were trying to recruit her from that

623
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,230
event during the whole then they never

624
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,570
saw it coming they never thought that

625
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,190
she is the face as someone who would be

626
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,970
a hacker so this is a very different

627
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:39,170
thing for her so yeah and now she works

628
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,460
at point three yeah I'm gonna share

629
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,740
about my colleagues cuz I love them

630
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,330
they're amazing as she was offered a

631
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,780
software developer position now she's a

632
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,669
wanna be a researcher and yes because

633
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,649
this is my second time giving this talk

634
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,110
I want to get to know your story

635
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,220
if there has been anything that

636
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,409
gamification has helped get you where

637
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,650
you are today and InfoSec I want to know

638
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:03,240
it and I want to put it on here and yes

639
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:06,950
we can change your photo and your name

640
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,950
if you like but I would love to do that

641
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:13,070
and last night at least

642
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:17,030
who was inspired by the movie hackers

643
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,030
does I remember her name

644
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:31,200
no cause it starts with a V Valentina

645
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:43,580
you said Valentina okay I'm gonna go

646
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:43,580
with you chica teresa's thank you

647
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,340
so from the stories are brain

648
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,110
functioning and history is very clear

649
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,830
that gamification is a necessity right

650
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:57,659
now and honestly is because let's be

651
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,470
real we're all superheroes wear that

652
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,900
every day heroes

653
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,130
well I breaking things fixing things

654
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,780
we're keeping everyone safe we're

655
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,820
keeping our neighbors safe we're keeping

656
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,710
our families safe and that's the

657
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,870
fantastic thing it's like giving myself
