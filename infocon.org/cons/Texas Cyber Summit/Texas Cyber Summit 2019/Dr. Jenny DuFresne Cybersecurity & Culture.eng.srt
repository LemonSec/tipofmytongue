every organization has a culture

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,169
everyone whether whether it's an

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,629
intentional culture or an unconscious a

10
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:02,600
culture every organization has a culture

11
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:04,970
okay so so what why is she here what do

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,479
we care about this so cyber security and

13
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,009
culture we partner with cyber war

14
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,289
fighters group which is a cyber cyber

15
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,149
security consulting firm we partner with

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,190
them when they go in and do engagements

17
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:18,350
into companies and organizations all

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,470
across the country and we work on the

19
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:24,890
people side so we're helping address

20
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,229
your biggest threat to cyber which is

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,759
your two legged you're human beings

22
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:35,600
right exactly

23
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:41,950
so you you see this here what comes to

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,949
mind insider threat what else

25
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:50,030
poor cyber hygiene what else phishing

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,680
attacks right all of that is the stuff

27
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,210
that's happening inside so if you have a

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,259
culture that's weak apathetic disengaged

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,850
uninterested those are the collection of

30
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,590
human beings inside of your four walls

31
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,689
or however many whatever your physical

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:07,460
structure is that are creating the

33
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:10,160
opportunities for for your your for your

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,130
company to be a attacked or otherwise

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,200
compromised okay so and the one that we

36
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:19,700
do a cyber war fighters group we partner

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,290
with them while they're doing doing

38
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,828
their work and penetration testing and

39
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,320
other things human side because we don't

40
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,620
typically do that right typically think

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,750
just technical would you all agree we

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,850
typically think just technical but again

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,250
all the stuff that we know that breaks

44
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,980
down is has starts with human beings or

45
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,460
human beings are a critical factor in

46
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,929
that so that's why we end up

47
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,590
in with cyber war fighters group to help

48
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,870
to help their clients really be able to

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,780
accelerate the work that they're doing

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,390
so as you all said culture is made up of

51
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,760
your values your behaviors your mission

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,140
your vision and and all and and and all

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,380
the like your teamwork trust

54
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,220
transparency

55
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,519
those are real critical elements of

56
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:12,060
culture that we sometimes tend to forget

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,400
our customers are important what are the

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,230
norms inside of our company so some of

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,940
you may be in companies now how many of

60
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,040
you are heads of companies just so I can

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,660
know how many are leaders of companies

62
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,859
okay great

63
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,710
how many of you are leaders of

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,990
departments or divisions or teams okay

65
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,060
great and the rest of you tell me where

66
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,960
you work what your role is inside your

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,630
company just holler out whatever

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,950
Business Development okay okay great

69
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,430
who's responsible for culture in your

70
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:46,410
company everybody if anyone knows that

71
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,030
something is not going well the way

72
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,770
we're talking to each other the way

73
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,510
we're interacting with which if anyone

74
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,730
knows that it is his or her

75
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,739
responsibility to resolve it to figure

76
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,500
out what are we supposed to be doing to

77
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,450
really live your values and move things

78
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,350
forward so core values are really

79
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:14,730
critical now too so at each of the

80
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:16,920

the quiz 30 more seconds 15 more seconds

169
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:17,430
all right wrap up your last thoughts all

170
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:24,390
right bring your bring your final

171
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:26,550
comments to a close so just I'd love to

172
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,310
hear just some feedback what what

173
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:33,719
surprised you about the quiz and mind

174
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:37,079
you this is just a snapshot we do much

175
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,050
more in-depth culture assessments and

176
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,030
organizations so we get really objective

177
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,010
data because it's coming from all levels

178
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,560
of the organization rather than just

179
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,600
from one single person so out of this

180
00:15:46,560 --> 00:16:01,229
what surprised you anything surprise you

181
00:15:48,600 --> 00:16:03,150
yes so this is actually something really

182
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,890
important like inside of a culture

183
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,290
imagine when you have new team members

184
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,240
so if you're we work with one of the top

185
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:14,400
fastest 50 growing companies in Texas

186
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,960
and in Austin Texas and imagine taking

187
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,970
what you just said that if you're hiring

188
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,490
lots of people if you're in rapid growth

189
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,200
imagine that everyone who comes in if

190
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,880
you don't have a clear way of training

191
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,910
them and acclimating them everyone has a

192
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,640
different idea of what culture means or

193
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,050
what your values may mean people may

194
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,740
have a different idea of what it means

195
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:37,079
to have fun for example right if you

196
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,890
came out of a organization where having

197
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,360
fun was you know analyzing data right

198
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,880
that might look different from a company

199
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,589
that having fun meant you know jumping

200
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,140
out of buildings right so it's very

201
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:54,770
different so other things that surprised

202
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,770
you or in your conversations yes

203
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:09,569
okay so at the top is that the c-suite

204
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:12,360
level is it you're saying you thought it

205
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,629
would be higher okay and so in that

206
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:20,490
again imagine if you have 50 employees

207
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:23,189
or 550 employees that unless ear unless

208
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,199
you really focus in on your culture the

209
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,660
folks at the in the mid-level managers

210
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,799
might think things are ducky right

211
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,020
c-suite folks might think things are

212
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,418
just amazing from their particular lens

213
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,299
but the people who were everyday your

214
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:39,480
backbone may say hey this place you know

215
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:45,559
Glassdoor don't ever come here right

216
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,559
other observations oh sorry thank you

217
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,020
absolutely it's it's super critical we

218
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,969
just started working with with another

219
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,990
client who has a rapidly growing company

220
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:58,110
in Austin and the c-suite thinks things

221
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,960
are great fabulous they did an employee

222
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,659
an employee survey and found out that

223
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,870
they have some massive issues the

224
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,760
massive

225
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,100
Mack truck hits you knocks you over

226
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,720
kinds of issues right but again it is

227
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,580
really important to get data points so

228
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,779
that's just an opportunity for you guys

229
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,110
to kind of just you know be able to

230
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:19,210
think about some questions that you may

231
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,590
not think about normally and then also

232
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,270
again going back to the cyber

233
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,678
perspective what what kind of threat is

234
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,570
that what kind of threat could it

235
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,860
present to your company or if you're

236
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,539
working with other companies what kinds

237
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,168
of threats could that potentially

238
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:37,149
present to them so 7 culture building

239
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:38,529
blocks excuse me the first one and if

240
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:43,449
you have a place to jot these down

241
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:47,320
the first one is vision every culture

242
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:50,230
that is worth its salt has a very strong

243
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,779
and very robust vision and not just a

244
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,330
statement on the wall it is the vision

245
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:58,330
that is lived and so what are some

246
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:01,809
elements of a vision so it's a it's a

247
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:07,270
clear picture of a future state that's

248
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:08,590
ideal or desirable right so how many of

249
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,950
you have vision statements by the way

250
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:15,490
just out of curiosity one two three four

251
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:18,850
okay okay so if you if you think about

252
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,620
your vision statement right now is it a

253
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,620
vision statement that you would say is

254
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,149
inspiring it pulls people forward it

255
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,639
makes people want to jump out of bed

256
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,870
every morning one of the vision

257
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,419
statements that I talk about a lot

258
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,969
really which was one affected our

259
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:37,149
country is when President John F Kennedy

260
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:39,520
Kennedy set the vision that the US would

261
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:42,399
go would send a man to the moon and

262
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,529
bring him back safely in under ten years

263
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:46,239
and so there was note there was there

264
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:48,190
was no technology to do a lot of the

265
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,620
things that had to be done right but

266
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:54,039
that vision was so powerful that even

267
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:57,158
the janitor who was you know sweeping

268
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:58,629
the floor knew what his role was and

269
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,860
helping that vision happen and that's

270
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,240
what you want to have for a vision

271
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,389
statement you want to have something so

272
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,190
dynamic and it's a clear vision picture

273
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,520
I made a clear picture sometimes we do

274
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,860
things like you know they're 45 lines of

275
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,679
the vision statement right can you

276
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,120
internalize that it's a bunch of it's

277
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,429
like a paragraph and a half can you

278
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,199
internalize that you cannot

279
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,279
so you want to have something you want

280
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,360
if you're thinking about your vision

281
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,249
statement or you know you need to

282
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,449
refresh your vision statement you want

283
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:31,119
to have something that is sharp it's

284
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,190
clear and anyone I would say can get it

285
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,529
in their belly very quickly and you can

286
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,879
always reference it Ali as wherever you

287
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,139
are in the leadership or wherever you

288
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,269
are on organization you can always

289
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:42,840
reference the work back to the vision

290
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:46,210
statement okay so that's the first big

291
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,189
component of thriving and dynamic and

292
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,029
inspiring culture is to have a vision

293
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:54,330
that is really robust and powerful the

294
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:56,710
second we talked about this B earlier is

295
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:00,070
values how many of your company have

296
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:05,519
values core values great someone tell me

297
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:07,658
what your core values are what is it

298
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:19,240
ferocious integrity what does that look

299
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:21,039
like as a behavior or as an action okay

300
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,480
awesome does that happen that even if

301
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,970
it's part our people ferociously okay

302
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,529
that's awesome so you guys have done it

303
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:34,179
sounds like you've done a great job and

304
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:35,679
really demonstrating and having actions

305
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,450
and activities around what that means

306
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,679
what are some other values in your

307
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:43,779
organization's every voice matters how

308
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,289
does that how does that play out during

309
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,289
a meeting

310
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,990
you need an accent aspects down okay if

311
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,820
you report something or you make a

312
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,530
suggestion and it's not valued it's

313
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,360
still it's not going to result in any

314
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,070
sort of punitive measures and there's

315
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,560
gonna be a pre-heated shown where you

316
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,629
haven't purchased we go excellent and so

317
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,250
the reason I asked you have is that show

318
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,170
up at a meeting because sometimes in

319
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,390
meetings is where the you know we might

320
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,940
have some real differences of opinion or

321
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,170
differences of action and our instinct

322
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,570
often particularly when we're in

323
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,010
leadership roles is to take that big

324
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,540
steel thing and put it right over the

325
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,500
top of that person and shut them down

326
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,990
right and so if you have values that say

327
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,450
every voice matters then you really have

328
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,220
to make sure that in all of your actions

329
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,840
every voice matters what were some other

330
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,770
some of you had your hand up back here

331
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,929
respect and what does that look like

332
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,930
[Music]

333
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,910
okay excellent

334
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,750
and the reason I kind of asked and each

335
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,430
I I encourage each of you to really look

336
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,090
back at your values and really challenge

337
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:10,920
them but if you went to the custodian in

338
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,780
your building or you know who's part of

339
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,780
your company and ask them what does

340
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,090
respect look like to you

341
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,440
right what is it how is it action how is

342
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,199
it me how does it become actionable

343
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,270
every single day you may find that

344
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,040
there's some there's some disconnect

345
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,750
between what you say you want it to be

346
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,250
and what's actually happening and that

347
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,290
happens pretty consistently in most

348
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,700
organizations a lot of folks when

349
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,139
they're building new companies and

350
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,120
organizations or they're retooling

351
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,460
they'll go out on the internet and

352
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,469
they'll search some core values and then

353
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,620
they'll have you know Starbucks core

354
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,690
values show up Walmart's show up you

355
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,820
know Spanx show up and then we go oh

356
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,250
that sounds really good and take that

357
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,950
and then you plug it into yours right

358
00:24:50,250 --> 00:25:01,200
but core values come alive in behaviors

359
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,620
so what are our behaviors directly and

360
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
can

361
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,419
instantly aligned with what we see that

362
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:12,120
value is going to be the third is

363
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:14,010
purpose so this is really your

364
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,409
businesses part the purpose of your

365
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,080
business and the work that people are

366
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:21,240
doing inside of the company so is this

367
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,270
is the is the work that people are doing

368
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,040
is it meaningful work right all work

369
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,990
sometimes may not be meaningful right

370
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,270
but if people are consistently having

371
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,790
drudgery as work are they going to be

372
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,710
excited to come to work every day

373
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,240
no is it more likely they're going to be

374
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,030
over there somewhere clicking on things

375
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,140
that they shouldn't very likely right or

376
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,120
they're gonna be sending out stuff that

377
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,980
they shouldn't and so what's the purpose

378
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,928
of our work what's the purpose of our

379
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,640
business how does it impact whether it

380
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:49,290
impacts globally whether it impacts the

381
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,290
state the county whatever you're doing

382
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,520
what's its purpose and that becomes

383
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,010
really important why do you think that

384
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,000
purpose becomes really important in a

385
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:07,110
company culture it backs up values what

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,730
else it builds loyalty it provides a

387
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,770
reason for being there right and if

388
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,950
you're in a multi-generational you know

389
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,330
there's there's I think by next year

390
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,420
we're gonna have at least five

391
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:21,720
generations in the workplace right so

392
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:25,050
our younger folks are really much more

393
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,340
focused on what matters what's my

394
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,050
purpose in this company what's this

395
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,760
company's purpose in the world or in the

396
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,960
county in the state wherever and so it

397
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,730
becomes really important to make sure

398
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,179
that that's clear because in your roles

399
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:38,100
as leaders and reinforces of the culture

400
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,330
you want to always be conveying that

401
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,800
just like the vision statement you

402
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,840
always the vision you always want to be

403
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,990
conveying that so people are continued

404
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,520
to be pulled in rather than coming apart

405
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:51,950
and kind of drifting away so that makes

406
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,950
sense okay any questions about this

407
00:26:52,070 --> 00:27:02,939
awesome inclusion this is what number

408
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:05,580
four or five so in our world today we

409
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:10,290
can no longer afford not to think about

410
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:13,139
and be intentional about diversity

411
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,950
equity and diversity and inclusion in

412
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,840
our companies

413
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:23,080
makes profitable sense and it also ties

414
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,529
back with purpose with vision and values

415
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,799
and so this morning as an example since

416
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:34,000
this is a room of mostly men and we're

417
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:38,590
at a conference that attracts mostly men

418
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,610
or at a technical field one of the

419
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,918
things I read this morning is that

420
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:45,490
companies that have women in leadership

421
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,880
roles are 20% are on average 20% more

422
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:50,710
profitable than companies that do not

423
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,929
write so imagine for those of you that

424
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:56,909
are looking at your P&L and wondering

425
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:59,440
like what do we need to do Minh

426
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,000
the fact that maybe we have a company it

427
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,980
doesn't have any any women in it and

428
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,470
maybe you have a technology or doing

429
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,200
something that has a large female

430
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,659
customer base right so you see the power

431
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,480
of making sure that you're you have

432
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:17,350
those voices around the table I think

433
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,440
it's not just gender it's geography so I

434
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,549
was in a training a couple of weeks ago

435
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,539
imagine if you just have people from

436
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:27,820
Texas in your companies how beneficial

437
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,519
would that be to talking to people who

438
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:34,240
are in Utah or who are in the Pacific

439
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:37,360
Northwest or who are in the in the DC

440
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,940
area you guys see that that geography

441
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:47,289
itself has limitations right we talk

442
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:49,179
about age so if we tend to feel more

443
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:51,129
comfortable with people of our own age

444
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:54,429
whatever that may be

445
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:57,730
imagine how much information imagine how

446
00:28:54,429 --> 00:29:00,190
much disconnect we have when we are

447
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,990
trying to maybe engage people who are

448
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,549
younger or older than us whichever so

449
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,610
thinking about your company

450
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:09,789
culture through the lens of inclusion

451
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:12,309
and that it is good business sense would

452
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,960
you all agree does anyone disagree and

453
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,809
you can you can definitely disagree

454
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,860
does anyone disagree with that or see

455
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:19,860
where it's like not work

456
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,059
say say again so what's the first

457
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:41,490
cutting here the first part auditing you

458
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:45,059
read this more huh at least 20% so

459
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:49,230
there's a couple of reasons actually one

460
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:50,789
is that and I actually teach a whole

461
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,110
segment on women's leadership but one of

462
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,390
the things about women and leadership

463
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,059
roles is that while women while we are

464
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,150
risk takers we happen to take calculated

465
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:03,120
risks so we look ahead because we are

466
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:05,970
future focused if you think about women

467
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,129
women and families for example that we

468
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,049
think about what's the impact of actions

469
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,150
moving forward right so just giving you

470
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:15,480
this one example and that we do take

471
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:17,010
calculated risks so a woman leader who I

472
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,690
have a great deal of respect and

473
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,570
admiration for is Mary Barrera at

474
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,090
General Motors now people can get very

475
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,950
frustrated with the fact that we have

476
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,510
there a lot of her folks are on strike

477
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,270
right now but what's been really

478
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,650
interesting about her I was reading

479
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,408
something of an article about her

480
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,850
shutting down some of the plants she's

481
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:36,059
not just shutting them down to shut them

482
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,309
down

483
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:40,500
she said it shutting them down and

484
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:43,080
retooling moving away from fossil fuel

485
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,120
fed vehicles into more hybrid and

486
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,490
electric vehicles because her future

487
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,459
look is that that is going to have

488
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:52,080
that's that's where we're going right so

489
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,760
that fossil fuel vehicles are going to

490
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,039
kind of come the way at dinosaurs I

491
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,470
guess but that's an example of taking a

492
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,820
calculated risk

493
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,700
looking looking to the future so those

494
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:05,039
are some of the some of the reasons that

495
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:19,710
that article that they they've talked

496
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:26,460
about in an article there's no way you

497
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:28,440
can but it's also like even I look like

498
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,520
super late and when I started building

499
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,780
out the company I was like alright I

500
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,700
realize like I'm up like 2:00 a.m.

501
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,190
there's no way I can ask someone else to

502
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,780
select me do commit to the Kaseem level

503
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,220
that I'm committing so the good idea

504
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,780
just find someone that doesn't have kids

505
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,669
I don't know what category that is it's

506
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,918
now that guys this bright agent I know

507
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:49,049
I'm like don't fire anyone that's like

508
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,350
under 25 kids and so what what do you

509
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:52,500
see

510
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:54,620
just cuz this is great thank you what's

511
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,760
the what's the opportunity

512
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,489
what's another opportunity to think

513
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:46,429
about if you're just hiring what do you

514
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:46,429
think is lost in that 72 hours like that

515
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:08,700
so so so I think that you're right you

516
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,230
may any company lots of companies are

517
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,350
like this we're in Austin so this is

518
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,330
like norm the norm right but there's a

519
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,639
cost to it there's a financial cost to

520
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,110
people who are we burn them out quickly

521
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,880
that means we're losing corporate

522
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,350
knowledge on a consistent basis if we

523
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,090
have investors they should be thinking

524
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,918
about the amount of churn that we have

525
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:29,059
inside of organizations but that's also

526
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,649
becomes your culture so as organizations

527
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:34,428
get older so one of the companies we

528
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:36,189
just took on they started just like that

529
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,799
right there

530
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,720
now out of the startup phase and they're

531
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,200
kind of into the sort of mid teenager

532
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,240
phase right and guess what some of the

533
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,070
ways of being have become part of their

534
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,570
culture and it's biting them in the butt

535
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,340
like really biting them in the butt and

536
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,350
in some in and I just share that again

537
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,149
because they're sort of the Expediency

538
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:02,408
of the right now that we all can get

539
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:04,479
into but then thinking about balance

540
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:05,889
maybe is the thing here how do we find

541
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,990
balance what do we need to figure out

542
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:09,578
balance because it's all going to impact

543
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,879
our culture and if our culture is not

544
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:15,909
robust and sound we as leaders and

545
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,429
founders will end up working five times

546
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,050
more five times harder because we have

547
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,399
this sort of churn happening that we're

548
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,649
trying to manage and these just things

549
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:26,649
to think about we work with companies we

550
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:28,629
see you know the behaviors that we that

551
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:31,779
were good to get us to this from this

552
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:34,868
place to this place they sit they they

553
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,550
take hold right but not all those

554
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,409
behaviors do we want to continue to take

555
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,909
hold as we get older if you if you get

556
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,310
to a point or any of us get to a point

557
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:44,679
where we need to have seasoned stable

558
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,750
leaders and we have people who are

559
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,579
bananas you write the two a.m. people

560
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,139
they can start them to creating some

561
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:52,000
other challenges and having to reset

562
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,569
your culture and we kind of reconfigure

563
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,569
what's going on

564
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:52,530
people intend to burn out the people

565
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,380
right so I think there's I mean you you

566
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,940
raise but I think for the purpose of

567
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,590
this conversation around culture you

568
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,150
raise some really important things to

569
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:16,300
think about and so the next thing to

570
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:19,690
talk about is people right so how are we

571
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:23,770
engaging our employees and in that

572
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:25,240
engagement are they are they so uber

573
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:28,180
committed that they don't have lives

574
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:32,080
outside cuz that's not the best way to

575
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,879
run life right it's okay I get it but

576
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,290
it's things that as leaders that we have

577
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,120
to be thinking about how are we engaging

578
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:40,440
our people how are we nurturing and

579
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:43,569
growing our people if our if our view is

580
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,790
turn and burn by get them in get what we

581
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,590
need to get out get them out again that

582
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,840
may last for a while but there's gonna

583
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:53,500
come a point where our companies are

584
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:56,440
getting to a maturity stage where that

585
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,630
may not be as effective or we change as

586
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,850
leaders we also have our own evolution

587
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,360
once you have a child your whole life

588
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:07,000
changes right right and so or you get

589
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,010
married or whatever else but our people

590
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,220
are really important how are we engaging

591
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,470
our people are we acknowledging the

592
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,330
great job that they do not just sort of

593
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,850
as a dry eye hey Bobby did a great job

594
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,869
but really like celebrating people

595
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,819
really acknowledging the hard work

596
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:24,950
a commitment that they put in to build

597
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:26,779
the company how are we doing that

598
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,419
what is the consistent way that we're

599
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:32,180
doing it Howard and knowing it by by

600
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,380
individual so sometimes we take the sort

601
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,940
of employee engagement programs and we

602
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,499
take it from over here and we tighten we

603
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,539
we come to our company we drop it on

604
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:40,640
there we like that that works check we

605
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:42,170
got that done but that does not work

606
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,660
because we have people inside of our

607
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,980
organizations who need to be appreciated

608
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,680
and acknowledged and recognized in

609
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,349
different ways right the first thing is

610
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,359
to have the system the second thing is

611
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:56,269
to implement the system execute the

612
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,680
system with fidelity that again brings

613
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:59,839
people into the mission and the vision

614
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,859
and the values of the company and keeps

615
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,150
them keep them keeps them motivated to

616
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:07,869
come and do their very best work and

617
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:10,039
remember culture going back to

618
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,319
cybersecurity which you all are here for

619
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:16,490
is really critical if I have a bunch of

620
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:19,749
angry burned-out frustrated people the

621
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:23,328
likelihood that we have additional in

622
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:49,368
issues goes skyrockets we gonna say

623
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:51,980
something leader in that industry you

624
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:54,380
gotta know who those people are where

625
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,509
they come from what makes them tick cuz

626
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,039
your leadership style for that group of

627
00:38:56,509 --> 00:39:00,349
people is not going to be the same

628
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,960
leadership style this is going to be for

629
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:07,369
a factory working type mystery your your

630
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,410
your your your pool the bad side of you

631
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,450
is displayed differently I'm just saying

632
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,549
how you engage them how you communicate

633
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:21,859
them how you leverage your skills and

634
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:23,420
abilities correct absolutely absolutely

635
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,710
and going to your point you know if it's

636
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,730
if it's that they want to come in they

637
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,170
wouldn't do a thing and then they want

638
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:30,259
to go off someplace knowing that is

639
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:32,509
important but it is really important to

640
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:34,080
know your people and and as leaders it

641
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:36,780
is our responsibility no matter where

642
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,830
we are in the leadership the leadership

643
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:43,320
space leadership role it's really our

644
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,940
responsibility to figure out our people

645
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,990
at the end of the day if we're not

646
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,250
taking care of our people what happens

647
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:53,069
they're not taking care of us

648
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:55,410
it makes our jobs way more difficult as

649
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:57,300
leaders like it really really really

650
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,549
makes our jobs difficult and so this is

651
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,270
where culture again becomes such a

652
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:04,680
critical space to pay attention to as

653
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,240
those leadership development but that's

654
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,460
a whole nother conversation but culture

655
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,229
really is the place have you ever walked

656
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,570
into a building and you could feel what

657
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,940
their culture was just walking in you

658
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,740
guys ever have that experience have you

659
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,210
ever have you ever walked into a

660
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,589
building and you could feel it and you

661
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,130
wanted to get out of there as quickly as

662
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,920
possible

663
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,590
right imagine that that is because

664
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,840
people have figured that's that's not

665
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,460
important and in that same company if

666
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,720
you look them up on Glassdoor you check

667
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,470
them out someplace sounds your pebble

668
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,200
will find that they have a lot of

669
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:39,330
turnover as well a lot of agitated angry

670
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,560
people so innovation I think that

671
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,900
culture is really important for

672
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,549
innovation because especially in tech

673
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,850
sector and especially in environments

674
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:50,010
where we're asking a lot and demanding a

675
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:54,569
lot of people innovation really is the

676
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:57,630
space where we cultivate those great

677
00:40:54,570 --> 00:41:01,380
ideas right and so a question to ask

678
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:04,760
yourself is in my company where do the

679
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:09,540
great ideas come from do they come from

680
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,580
the top only or do they come from that

681
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,340
entry level person who's just learning

682
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,900
you know who's just learning the ropes

683
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,370
and the business and is having some

684
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,350
great ideas because again going back to

685
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,180
diversity or to including people with

686
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:23,279
different perspectives they've had maybe

687
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,930
they lived internationally and so how

688
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,700
the problems were solved internationally

689
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,200
they come and they have a great

690
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,990
innovative idea that can really help

691
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,890
bring great solutions to your customers

692
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,890
ok so yes

693
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,710
when you have that inclusiveness you

694
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,899
create an opportunity to be inventive

695
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,640
because now you've got that that

696
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,390
personal culture experience an enclosure

697
00:41:49,640 --> 00:42:00,470
coming to your team you miss that you

698
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:02,150
miss it thank you thank you it's really

699
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,649
important like innovation you think

700
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,050
about the innovations that we have today

701
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,250
they didn't come from all one group of

702
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,270
people they didn't come from just one

703
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,000
part of the world they didn't come from

704
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,040
one state right it's all the confluence

705
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,170
of all these different perspectives that

706
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,329
are really dynamic and so in your

707
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:19,130
organization's why is this thing

708
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:23,569
something for culture because it has a

709
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:26,720
lot to do with who were hiring how we

710
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:29,630
cultivate and prepare them and how we

711
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,750
create space for people to bring great

712
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:35,059
ideas forward so that means for example

713
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,589
that we can't be banging people over the

714
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:38,390
head if they do make mistakes or if they

715
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:41,210
do if they do you know they're testing

716
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,319
something and it it goes awry that we

717
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,940
don't want to come down and you know

718
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,980
write them up or whatever so you want to

719
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,190
be able to think about in our company

720
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:53,630
are we creating space in our culture

721
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:57,280
where innovation is is is key and then

722
00:42:53,630 --> 00:43:00,049
finally communication so all of this

723
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,230
that I've talked about the other six the

724
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:05,750
other six building blocks of culture

725
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:10,309
really come down to consistent

726
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:13,790
communication so raise your hand if you

727
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:17,809
whatever your role is if you let's say

728
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:20,990
so raise your hand if you hear about the

729
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:23,710
vision of your company every day raise

730
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,910
your hand so y'all look around

731
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:31,069
so you hear about the vision of your

732
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:32,899
company every day right you hear it

733
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:35,299
however either you're communicating or

734
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,710
you hear it you hear it if you are in a

735
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:38,420
leadership role you hear your employees

736
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,859
talk about it if you're and non

737
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,940
leadership role you hear someone talking

738
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:48,380
about the vision well you could do like

739
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:49,849
this halfway so so imagine that in a

740
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:54,440
room there's like 25 of you in here

741
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:59,719
known that we have half of a raise so

742
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,880
that's huge right that's a huge thing

743
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,469
that's maybe missing and maybe why

744
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,150
people are coming in and not quite

745
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:07,009
knowing where they fit and maybe people

746
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,839
coming in because they're making a great

747
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:10,160
salary but a great salary is not ever

748
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:13,029
gonna hold them in your company

749
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,319
it does not money does not hold anyone

750
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:18,529
it sounds good for a while but it

751
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:21,589
doesn't so think about how can you right

752
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:23,390
now no matter your role cuz again it

753
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:24,920
doesn't it doesn't matter wherever you

754
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:28,578
are in the organization how can you

755
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,969
start communicating every day the vision

756
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:34,089
of your company why are we here why is

757
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:37,309
this important the purpose of your work

758
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:39,288
what what you know hey new entry-level

759
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:40,489
person come on this is this is what's

760
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:42,799
really important about how you

761
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:44,839
contribute to our overall vision this is

762
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:47,119
how you really move and transform

763
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:48,529
customers you know whatever you solve

764
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,029
customer problems this is how you're

765
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:52,309
doing it this is why it's important

766
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:54,319
until it becomes so internalized can you

767
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:57,140
see what happens if people are that

768
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,779
galvanized every day can you see it

769
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,598
starts to pull people in they're part of

770
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:04,369
a team they know they know what they

771
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:26,160
know about your about your organization

772
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:29,470
are you disagreeing okay

773
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,640
okay what's missing though the in terms

774
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,899
of what I've talked about what's missing

775
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,980
and what you're saying what's missing

776
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:39,400
for what you'd that experience mm-hmm so

777
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:41,380
we talked about it preach it but we

778
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,000
don't live it which is going back to our

779
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,550
values same thing with values I walk

780
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,390
into so many companies they engage us

781
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:50,920
and rah rah rah I'm like okay well how

782
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:55,480
does that look since you just came in

783
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:58,990
late leader as an example right so it's

784
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,510
really if we have a vision how do we

785
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:04,839
make it alive every single day if we're

786
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:06,970
living our four five core values how are

787
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,970
they lived at the moment I walk in that

788
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,649
organization how is it lived if we say

789
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:13,660
we give great customer service and the

790
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:17,230
person at the front desk looks at me

791
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,970
like I have five heads we just broke it

792
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,100
right but that's the the power of

793
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:22,569
leadership is to figure out what are

794
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,910
those important things and how do I

795
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,920
communicate them every single day every

796
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,440
minute of the day every moment but that

797
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,750
I also live them that is the most

798
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,520
important thing in all of this is

799
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,950
culture does not happen unless people

800
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,350
are lip get clear about it and then live

801
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:40,350
it consistently no matter what

802
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:10,120
and that's hard like we some of us have

803
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,280
values in our company that they're

804
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,509
really difficult to live so then I would

805
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,750
encourage you to go back and think about

806
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:18,550
those values if I know that 90 percent

807
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,810
of my company is not living those values

808
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,460
and I'm the leader of that company

809
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,779
either we picked the wrong value we

810
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,580
picked it out of thin air it wasn't

811
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,730
really how we actually really live and

812
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:29,590
believe or we've just gotten away from

813
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,500
it because I my eyes been on these other

814
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:34,120
other things to focus on so

815
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,430
communication is really really critical

816
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,690
how do you and again it's not just to

817
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,520
your point and I appreciate you bringing

818
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,820
this up it's not just that we say it

819
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,310
won't walk right but how do we met how

820
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,680
do we reinforce it and any of these

821
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:50,830
their behaviors how do we reinforce what

822
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,990
we consistently want to see right if we

823
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:57,279
ignore absenteeism for example what do

824
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:59,740
we get more of more absenteeism right if

825
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,690
we if we value integrity who had

826
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:04,299
integrity yet integrity if we value

827
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:07,780
integrity but we fudge the numbers in

828
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,630
our budget which happens right or we do

829
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:24,790
whatever how are we living integrity

830
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:27,880
that makes sense I think it I think it's

831
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,680
yes and smaller companies can have the

832
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,790
exact same issues like if you think

833
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,160
about when you're building a company

834
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:36,220
right your focus on 9000 different

835
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,560
things and so some of the things that we

836
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,509
start off saying that we really value

837
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,160
you know if you have a you know if you

838
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,240
have something colossal that goes wrong

839
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,859
you need to focus all your attention

840
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,500
there you can focus your attention and

841
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,880
sometimes sacrifice your values right in

842
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,220
service to trying to get the whatever

843
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,920
fixed are done or what have you and so I

844
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:56,259
think it's it does the company size is

845
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,250
not it does not

846
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:01,510
keep keep this from being a challenge

847
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:04,210
because because little companies have

848
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:06,070
their own issues larger companies have

849
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:13,200
their own issues as well question

850
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:13,200
comment now

851
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:22,330
what's the repercussion for the

852
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:23,710
organization so if you have so and if

853
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,350
I'm hearing you correctly if you have

854
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,640
here's our values and we made a hire and

855
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,860
that person does not align with those

856
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,210
values if we let them sit there what

857
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,770
happen if we let them sit there and do

858
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:36,670
something contrary to our values what

859
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:38,200
happens to our company you get toxic and

860
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,150
you also get your entire culture comes

861
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,600
apart it doesn't like I saw an

862
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:46,570
organization once we're ignoring a

863
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:51,270
problem ignoring someone who was clearly

864
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:55,860
a misfit brought down we at that point

865
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:58,120
we had we had to work with this is a

866
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,820
government agency we had worked with

867
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:05,410
them for two years to move their culture

868
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:12,100
from super toxic to making some some

869
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:14,799
moves right one bad hire and then that

870
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:17,950
person's inability to do their job was

871
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:21,280
ignored by the larger and in vary in

872
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:22,540
them in about 20 days two years of work

873
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,760
went right out the door we had to

874
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,770
literally start all over again so it's

875
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,230
very very very important all right three

876
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,300
leader habits as we wrap up here these

877
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,680
are easy lead the vision talk it and

878
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,130
walk it we've just we've been kind of

879
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,230
going over that as leaders we have to

880
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:40,690
set the vision we got to lead it we have

881
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,280
to walk it even if it's difficult even

882
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:43,990
if we don't want to smile that day we

883
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,690
got to go in and smile if we if we're a

884
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:48,729
company that values fun right

885
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,750
relentless daily action so it's kind of

886
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:52,870
what I was just sharing a little while

887
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:54,040
ago we have to identify relentlessly and

888
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,960
you might need to schedule these if

889
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,370
you're in a leadership role is every day

890
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,900
I'm going to communicate something one

891
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,190
thing about the vision to my people or

892
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,290
I'm gonna ask my people to lead a

893
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:05,710
meeting and talk about the vision I'm

894
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:07,360
gonna push my my my team members to take

895
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,690
action but you have to have relentless

896
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,599
daily action

897
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:15,020
if not culture is very it can just sort

898
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,670
of drift away easily enroll and engage

899
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:44,030
everyone what does this mean to you guys

900
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:55,520
enroll and engage everyone yep so that's

901
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:57,530
one what did you say so every idea

902
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:05,420
matters any other ideas any other

903
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:07,099
thoughts or you just step back and then

904
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,589
bite your tongue and put your hands in

905
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:12,170
your pockets so that other people feel

906
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:14,089
that gap and they they will then

907
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,670
naturally move the inert to fill that

908
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,288
gap so Li division relentless daily

909
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,680
action and role and engage everyone that

910
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:24,109
is a pivotal and important set of

911
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,359
actions for leaders at any level of an

912
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:29,089
