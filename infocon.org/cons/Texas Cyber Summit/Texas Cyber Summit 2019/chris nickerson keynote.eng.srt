00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:32,890
while we worked all that out so I wanted

9
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,770
to mention a few things yesterday I

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,510
talked about that we ran for this

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,970
conference we ran two thousand feet of

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,720
fiber in this hotel some of the guys

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:46,750
that did that are here in the room and

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,930
myself the other thing is the hotel

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,700
didn't have enough bandwidth the

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,350
internet coming in so we actually worked

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,870
with gigabit X which is over in the

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,550
corner in the sponsor area to run a

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,250
microwave connection from the building

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,349
across the street so we could have a 700

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,269
Meg connection that then goes down into

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,979
the room where we have a stack of

23
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,540
switches and firewalls and then we're

24
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:09,909
tied in to the infrastructure that we

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,079
ran ourselves which was 2,000 feet of

26
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,549
fiber and about 3000 feet of copper so

27
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,079
so we built out the network over over a

28
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,079

86
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,920

93
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,599
right yeah so we're recording three

94
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,729
tracks plus the keynote so there'll be a

95
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,409
couple of them a couple that we're not

96
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,740
covering just because it's such a new

97
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:35,030
event and we only have so many resources

98
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:39,259
so one thing I wanted to cover real

99
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,989
quick before I introduce Chris is so all

100
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,960
of us have grandparents or parents or

101
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,449
relatives that are elderly and I just

102
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,400
want to mention that that those those

103
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,449
people need your help in securing their

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,060
environment

105
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:55,190
they're gonna become your problem later

106
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,440
on if they send you something and you're

107
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,199
not expecting it in your random you just

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,960
accidentally click on it you become you

109
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,340
become the next victim from something

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,440
that one of your relatives or your

111
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,060
parents has so I would I would just

112
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,500
suggest everybody in here spend a little

113
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,190
bit of time with their parents or

114
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,110
grandparents and help them be more wary

115
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,879
of the internet you know less trustful

116
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,560
of emails that they're getting start

117
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,029
scrutinizing things question everything

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,500
and and I think just doing that you're

119
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:25,909
gonna help protect yourself because

120
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,409
obviously they're going to communicate

121
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:30,110
with you at some point and you never

122
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:32,180
know what you're gonna get so there are

123
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:36,830
several programs out there to help with

124
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,560
with doing that I just wanted to point

125
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,020
that out so we all of us in this room

126
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,969
can make a difference if we help our

127
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,580
parents and grandparents and relatives

128
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:51,830
if you don't have anything help your

129
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,419
neighbor lastly I wanted to mention that

130
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,599
the hotel does have lunch

131
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,609
it's 1395 downstairs but there's also a

132
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,659
ton of restaurants around here that's

133
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,300
the reason that we're doing it on the

134
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,819
Riverwalk is so that you guys for that

135
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,440
there's a lot of people in town but they

136
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,440
live here they never make it down to the

137
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,870
Riverwalk I'm one of those people so

138
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:15,050
yeah so having you down here was it was

139
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,400
you know kind of the point of having

140
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,650
this event was to have it on the

141
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,060
Riverwalk so people in town or out of

142
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,500
town could come and enjoy the river walk

143
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,690
so spend some time down there if you can

144
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,120
and lastly

145
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,940
I wanted to thank Chris Nickerson for

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,580
coming out and doing our keynote speaker

147
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,830
this morning

148
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,280
Thanks so without further ado Chris

149
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,280
Nickerson

150
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:11,000
nope it didn't die its Undead yes good

151
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,628
morning for those of you who haven't

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,930
slept

153
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:20,479
good evening still I'm not gonna talk

154
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:25,340
about anything special so don't expect a

155
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,770
whole lot I figure it's the morning it's

156
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,568
hard to digest certain things I think

157
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,188
when some people like belabor on about

158
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,599
like technical things in the morning I

159
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,620
end up checking out even if I really

160
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,750
want to hear what they're talking about

161
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,360
because my brain is somewhere between

162
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,370
the legs trying to wake up and coffee

163
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,669
and then like thinking about the stuff

164
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,310
that I failed to do last night so I'm

165
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:50,620
gonna give you a little bit of my

166
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:53,479
morning brain of a little bit on kind of

167
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,419
what I've been able to observe in the

168
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,818
industry and also some of my kind of

169
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,460
gripes as well as some of the things

170
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,469
that I really wish that we could do that

171
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,878
I don't really think can be done through

172
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,069
a technical nature and I don't think it

173
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,839
can be done just because I you're right

174
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:12,289
an RFC for it I think it's something

175
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,940
that we have to choose to do so that's

176
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:23,360
that's it if you don't like it I don't

177
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:26,150
really care so I want to try and stop

178
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,919
dumpster fire as a service because I

179
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,198
feel like there's a lot of that going on

180
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,149
there's a lot of it that gets promoted

181
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,979
to the industries whether it's

182
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,809
personally or technically like there's a

183
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,610
ton of dumpster fire that happens and

184
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,750
like I think there's some ways to solve

185
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:44,000
it so first I have to think I won't say

186
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,110
the c-word so that no one has to drink

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,110
but Texas summit

188
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,610
okay

189
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,410
but yeah it's things like this that

190
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,300
really get us to a point where we can

191
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,969
share information and I think that that

192
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,010
is really the genesis of where this

193
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,750
whole industry started and it's

194
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,090
something that I have to applaud because

195
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,330
people put all of their time and hard

196
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:11,100
work and weekends and to doing stuff

197
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,350
like this whether it's sharing whether

198
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,840
it's listening just being present alone

199
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,770
that type of participation is what built

200
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,900
this industry so I applaud all of you

201
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,670
for being participants and being part of

202
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,470
an industry and giving yourselves and

203
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,910
your weekends and things like that to

204
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,520
this profession because not a lot of

205
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,810
other people will really go that far for

206
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:41,880
their job so thank you all okay

207
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:45,060
seriously my disclaimer is long there's

208
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:50,220
lots of them now that you have seen it

209
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,630
you are responsible not me I if you

210
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,790
don't like any of those things that's

211
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,790
super cool you have the opportunity to

212
00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:00,060
get up and leave right now I am an equal

213
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,819
opportunity hater I like and dislike

214
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,689
everything equally I don't really care

215
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,550
if if one thing is super PC or not which

216
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,280
isn't really good all the time but at

217
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:14,359
the same time I have love for everything

218
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,370
in everyone okay so that's me

219
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,220
when I tried to take over is C squared

220
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:24,960
and it totally worked and then I denied

221
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:27,240
getting on the board it worked out but I

222
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,540
figured you know the Russian propaganda

223
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,810
look was the way to go

224
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,329
I've tried a bunch of other things and

225
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,489
in the industry to participate you know

226
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,520
whether it's working at crest trying to

227
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:45,150
help set standards or at ISC or aisaka

228
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:48,689
or being part of a trust board I did

229
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:50,990
something with this for any of you that

230
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,060
that know or don't know

231
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,830
this started because of a house party

232
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,329
that I wanted people to pay for the

233
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:03,579
drinks it's the real reason

234
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:06,189
haha and has now grown to being 435

235
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:16,359
events across like 60 different

236
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:17,829
countries so right yeah I'm all about

237
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,779
the community I think it's great I think

238
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,299
the more that we can we can give the

239
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,429
more that we'll get this is my

240
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,529
professional background for anyone who

241
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:29,410
wants to say no you're full of and

242
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:31,029
lying that's fine I'm probably am but

243
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,738
this is the whole reason that you know

244
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,179
reason you should believe me slide I've

245
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,470
worked at all these really big companies

246
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:38,738
and I've owned my company for the last

247
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:42,579
10 years doing testing and stuff I mean

248
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:49,869
we do stuff like pen testing I know it's

249
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:56,888
early huh too fast this one code review

250
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:58,529
anyone know yeah good warm this up a

251
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:09,879
little bit

252
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:15,610
instant response it's just disgusting

253
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:18,179
risk assessments yeah we do physical

254
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,179
security

255
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:25,710
and like everyone else who thinks that

256
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:29,040
they're a super badass we were probably

257
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:31,670
the first company to be commercial doing

258
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,670
red teaming

259
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:43,940
oh yeah all right so I need to talk

260
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:45,650
about our choo-choo does anyone know

261
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,540
where that is I feel like every time I

262
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,069
meet people from DC and I show that

263
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,860
picture somewhere they're like I know

264
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,270
where that is because all of us stand in

265
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,120
front of it and it's just that like a

266
00:12:53,270 --> 00:13:00,020
moment of reflection like this is really

267
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,720
what it's coming down to isn't it all

268
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:07,250
right so here's some of my stitching

269
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,610
bitch first we have a huge problem with

270
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,750
taxonomy does anyone just right off the

271
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,330
bat before I have to try and convince

272
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,000
you agree with that all right yes

273
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,970
there's a couple people we have a good

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,500
start right okay like what's a pen test

275
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,590
well it's a whole bunch of things

276
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,840
depending on whoever the salesperson is

277
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,720
whatever the skill set is whatever the

278
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,820
client says whatever random thing that

279
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,040
they've read haven't read whatever you

280
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,980
know preconceived notion about X Y Z

281
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,140
think that's there there's all these

282
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,710
different things that they get and we

283
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:46,460
get mad when we see someone else's pen

284
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:48,500
test that sucks or maybe we don't even

285
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,030
know that it sucks or you know we don't

286
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,250
really have a gauge for it because the

287
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,189
taxonomy is all over the place right we

288
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,860
have you know this oh I do vulnerability

289
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,470
assessments or I'm a pen tester or I'm a

290
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,270
red teamer which I'm not even that's a

291
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,950
whole series of talks I could get

292
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:08,180
started on why that's not real but you

293
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,580
know they have all these different

294
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:15,530
definitions now I've provided a couple

295
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:17,030
definitions as well I think at the end

296
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:21,470
of the day what we're really looking to

297
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:25,060
do in take pen testing is we're trying

298
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:28,880
to understand what are the viable means

299
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,829
for causing some type of impact now

300
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,130
whether that means on the inside whether

301
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,940
it's the outside whether it's

302
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,950
electronically whether it's somewhere

303
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,690
else we're really trying to be the

304
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,990
sparring partner the environment to say

305
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,260
do your controls even work I mean

306
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,930
anybody done auditing before

307
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,520
okay so you know in an audit there's

308
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,160
test of design the test of effectiveness

309
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,020
right so I mean testing for us should

310
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,670
just be purely test of effectiveness I

311
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,170
mean we're not trying to make an

312
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,260
assumption or make a decision for

313
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,870
someone we're trying to say did your

314
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,490
design work and it's there's really no

315
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,070
emotion inside of that now I know it

316
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,350
ends up being a really emotional thing

317
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,970
sometimes but but really what we're

318
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,280
trying to get out of that is a

319
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,320
validation of our design in ways that we

320
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,020
can improve it now what ends up

321
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,930
happening is you get somebody who makes

322
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,430
a new term up right and then the

323
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,160
industry eventually catches on to that

324
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,599
term and then people who used to be

325
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,870
doing vulnerability assessment now do

326
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,530
pen testing why because the salespeople

327
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,790
can make more money and because they can

328
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,310
make more money because they're like

329
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,780
well it's kind of like that and no one's

330
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,790
gonna know the difference so I'll just

331
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,350
hit Nessus scan and instead of giving

332
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,240
them a report says necess on it I will

333
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,880
use the logo function to put my logo on

334
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,000
it and be like you got a pen test that

335
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,950
sucks so we have to kind of figure out

336
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,420
some common language to remove some of

337
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,670
those things from our industry one of

338
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:59,760
the other ones that I absolutely hate is

339
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:02,260
the word risk quantifying risk is

340
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,150
ridiculous for a lot of the way that we

341
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,130
do it now there's other professions in

342
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,380
the world that really do it well but us

343
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,080
in InfoSec look at that absolutely

344
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,560
ridiculous equation means and motive

345
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,560
okay so you called LulzSec and you're

346
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,109
like hey why'd y'all hack me cuz

347
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,839
whatever 1-800 call the hacker that got

348
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,280
you or something and then they give you

349
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,920
means and motive which is you know a

350
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,920
word so you take you know because I hate

351
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,689
you and for the lulz and you multiply

352
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,520
that by the opportunity which is

353
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,950
whenever I feel like and the is business

354
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,660
impact is all the things and you you put

355
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,640
that over your controls and you end up

356
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,550


357
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,050
like every single time you get the

358
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:50,349
divide by zero

359
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:53,769
it's a stupid equation I'm sorry it's

360
00:16:50,350 --> 00:17:00,700
it's really ironic right that that were

361
00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:03,850
the people trying to quantify risk for

362
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:06,400
someone else like and in a lot of times

363
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,170
those people don't even know what their

364
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,420
own environment is and they're expecting

365
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,220
us to do that for them right we have to

366
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,720
get people to connect with what the real

367
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,880
value is in their environment and tell

368
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,189
us right we're just there as the

369
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,350
metadata to be like hey control works or

370
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:23,260
doesn't work you're the one who tells us

371
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:24,969
whether it could be a you know major

372
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,419
financial impact it could be something

373
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,500
else right so we can't we can't we can't

374
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:31,630
get to the point we're constantly

375
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,150
prescribing and I think a lot of that

376
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:39,370
stuff is solved by us figuring out some

377
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,960
better taxonomy I can say all that stuff

378
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,110
but it doesn't mean if you try

379
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,059
right so I tried I did a couple

380
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:50,590
different things to try and fix that I

381
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:52,960
learned that it probably wasn't within

382
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,149
one person's context to do I mean like

383
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,990
the P test thing all right so a bunch of

384
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:02,230
us got really hammered at a hotel one

385
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:05,110
night and I decided to I'm not gonna

386
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,559
call it se but I like I walked into a

387
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,959
conference room and then ordered the

388
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,530
service that I had which you know

389
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,150
whatever I want to tape then they

390
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,440
brought in the drink service and

391
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,830
everything else and we conducted our

392
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,270
meeting as scheduled and the whole

393
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,299
meeting was at shmoocon

394
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:28,090
with you know 28 25 people and this big

395
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:31,059
giant sheet of paper that we taped

396
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,490
together then we drew out hey what does

397
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:35,710
the pen test look like how should you do

398
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,630
it and then all of us went back and

399
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,809
started writing and then it ended up is

400
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,340
this like guideline and then magically

401
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,309
the guideline got picked up by like NIST

402
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:48,610
and PCI okay I felt good about it

403
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:51,340
now how many times have I been with a

404
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,899
customer or been with a friend or been

405
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,350
with someone that's in the industry

406
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,039
buying up

407
00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:00,580
test and you know I hear rapid7 go like

408
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,559
oh yeah you know next pose follows P

409
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,199
test and I'm like it failed I

410
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,289
completely feel that that one but I

411
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,539
tried I tried giving some talks about it

412
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:12,759
I don't I don't think that's necessarily

413
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:16,330
helped but I'm gonna keep trying I had a

414
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:20,080
shitty TV show that got broken and

415
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,820
kicked off the air because of some

416
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,658
hilarious other stories that I can share

417
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,428
in other places I I tried to start a

418
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:39,490
string of conferences and got trolled by

419
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:41,830
friends so I had lots of lessons learned

420
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,779
I don't think I have figured out how to

421
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,210
solve it yet so it's my first problem

422
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:48,370
that I give to all of you is how do we

423
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,799
fix taxonomy how do we how do we get to

424
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,459
a point of common language where we

425
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,799
remove whatever selfless in this that we

426
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,509
can or we have whatever selves we can to

427
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,668
try and get to a point we're all saying

428
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:02,919
the same thing and it's not just to be

429
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:05,350
the like this better than this or this

430
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,029
cooler than that or stops more than this

431
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,730
or whatever else can we just get to like

432
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:13,210
a basic term book because I think that

433
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,070
it would help us I don't know what other

434
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,340
ideas there are here's some of my ideas

435
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,110
if you have some tell me I'll help even

436
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,309
if I can't help I'll try and find people

437
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,799
to help because I think it's something

438
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:27,039
that needs to be fixed

439
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:29,320
I don't think compliance in it is gonna

440
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,240
be the way but at the same time at least

441
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,470
that puts the language down on paper at

442
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,419
least there's someone else

443
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,730
auditing against that language so I

444
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:39,220
can't hate it completely as much as I've

445
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,769
given talks my entire life about how

446
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,840
compliance is absurd I still have to

447
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:46,690
kind of respect that it's going to get

448
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,949
the language in somebody's ear the

449
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,009
dictionary might work

450
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:53,850
any other ideas it's early so I can't

451
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:53,850
really ask you to participate

452
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:59,718
but I think that I think that we need to

453
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,299
try and work on that somewhere so if any

454
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:03,460
of you have any interest in that I'm

455
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:09,830
here to help

456
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:13,549
scalability I I think that we don't

457
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:16,039
scale and I know that we don't scale

458
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:19,039
because I myself completely don't scale

459
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,719
I don't know if any of you own a

460
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,219
business have owned a business or been

461
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:26,359
part of that have family or whatever

462
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:28,940
else I had no idea how to run a business

463
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,228
when I started it I just did it and I

464
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,529
was like I'm just gonna do the right

465
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:35,179
thing which is really hard and then I'm

466
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,499
gonna try and do the right thing against

467
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:38,719
a bunch of people who want to compete

468
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:43,009
with me who also have tons of money and

469
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:46,039
I'm poor super super easy that's the

470
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:47,659
best part of it and beyond that when

471
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,859
you're trying to scale you try and do

472
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,049
everything on your back because you're

473
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:53,928
trying to make it work right like when I

474
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:56,749
had my first couple employees every

475
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:58,759
night was a what am I going if it was a

476
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:00,529
successful day what am I gonna do about

477
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,809
keeping it successful if it wasn't a

478
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,849
successful day it was like my friends

479
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,979
and people that I love and care about

480
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:10,218
their family isn't gonna eat tomorrow

481
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:14,539
because I suck and the scalability is

482
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:16,789
super hard there so I didn't figure out

483
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,109
how I could try and scale the thing that

484
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:20,059
we were bringing to the industry for

485
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:21,918
quite a long time I was trying to put it

486
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,139
all on my back I was trying to just fly

487
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,509
all over the world and do all of the

488
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:28,459
things and ended up not being half as

489
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:31,039
effective as I needed to be because I

490
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,349
didn't understand really how to scale

491
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,779
and I think that our industry has a lot

492
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:37,899
of problems of you know we sit inside

493
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:40,609
the echo chamber yelling about the user

494
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:42,619
versus enrolling the user to be on our

495
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,839
team and fight on the squad and now we

496
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:48,349
have an army of millions versus an army

497
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,059
of tens right so I think that that

498
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:51,739
that's another thing that I want to try

499
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:54,649
and take on and I would love to hear

500
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:56,809
anyone's thoughts about how do we

501
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:58,668
actually scale the passion that's in

502
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:01,309
this room the passion that makes you get

503
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:03,829
up in the morning and be in a place and

504
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,710
listen to some jackass on stage at 8:30

505
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,720
and the more

506
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,750
talk about all this stuff how do we

507
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,360
bring that passion to the world not just

508
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,730
to a community next to us or even to one

509
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,500
other person but how do we scale that so

510
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,120
it's not everyone trying to bring it on

511
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,610
their own back walking around with a

512
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,969
couple nails and be in the martyr right

513
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,949
so I think I think some of those things

514
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,510
that I've found that have been a little

515
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,010
bit successful but I don't know how how

516
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,660
well they'll be received with the rest

517
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,280
of the world like like having

518
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,260
apprenticeship programs or having

519
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,510
mentorship programs I think that those

520
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,700
things are really important I think that

521
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,410
a lot of times that when you know people

522
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,360
are in schools and they're doing stuff

523
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,680
in the lab it feels really really good

524
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,740
to do something in the lab because it's

525
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,500
built to work when you do stuff in the

526
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,080
real world it is built to not work like

527
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,810
I'm telling you like most of the stuff

528
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,760
we do is not intended to work so like

529
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,230
we're already going uphill trying to

530
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,010
figure out how to do these things in our

531
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:04,020
job I think the more we get to work

532
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,690
community wise the more you know these

533
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,879
CTFs happen the more that people are

534
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,350
banging on this stuff or sharing some of

535
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,720
their research I think the more

536
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,909
interested others get and if we can

537
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,130
lower the bar to entry and give that

538
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,530
welcoming arm to people I think that we

539
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:23,390
can do something about it I don't know

540
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:27,720
the answer though okay more questions

541
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:31,080
why don't we measure anything like as an

542
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:35,040
industry we measure almost nothing I

543
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,830
mean the best part I think of every

544
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,970
single time I see an interface for a

545
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:43,970
security tool best thing about it is

546
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,970
that

547
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:51,180
always and I'm gonna say always all the

548
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:56,150
way across the board always I will see

549
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:59,970
something that says stopped X bad thing

550
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:02,190
how many got through what do you mean I

551
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:06,540
don't know how many got through stopped

552
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:08,150
X bad thing out of how many no idea well

553
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,990
then how is the graph even relevant

554
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:16,170
don't know but it looks super cool okay

555
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:19,440
I got it like it's it's a it's a glamor

556
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:21,810
graph right but how do we get beyond

557
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,000
glamour graph we have to really measure

558
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:27,300
in order to really measure we have tons

559
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,310
of work to do right we're not we're in

560
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,100
this we're in this game where we try and

561
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,169
play the like oh okay well you're the

562
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,659
one who didn't install this patch or my

563
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,600
security program is X amount secure

564
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,780
because I'm chasing patch management

565
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,240
okay

566
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,649
race to zero good job going to the

567
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,570
bottom you're gonna just continue to

568
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,100
chase your tail and every time Tuesday

569
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,139
comes out you're gonna feel like you're

570
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,429
far away and then every time that it's

571
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,050
Monday you'll feel that you're more

572
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,660
secure and then every Tuesday it's gonna

573
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,690
suck again that just sounds like a bad

574
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,130
life so I think that we need to start

575
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:04,470
trying to figure out how to measure

576
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:07,080
things better I have been tackling this

577
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:12,000
particular one to last probably two

578
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:14,490
years and working with you guys will see

579
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,560
talks on like or have done stuff or

580
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,190
worked with like miters attack framework

581
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:23,730
right it's good for a common taxonomy

582
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:27,300
it's very good for being able to provide

583
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:31,770
a baseline so that when I say did you

584
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:34,560
stop T 105 or t1 105 your tool that's

585
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:37,889
supposed to stop t1 105 says I stopped

586
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,250
t1 105 like really really great you know

587
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,660
it's right now we're just kind of like

588
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,890
have a gun and we're shooting at a berm

589
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,060
and they're like how many times did you

590
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,680
hit the target and you're like always

591
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,129
and you're like how accurate were you

592
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,870
you're like always and then people

593
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,500
wonder why like you know you didn't stop

594
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:03,080
a PT pro 9000 bear or whatever random

595
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:06,600
gold elite thing of the day right so

596
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,399
part of that I'm trying to do don't know

597
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,020
if it's gonna work one of the things

598
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,840
that I have found is that in inventory

599
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:19,770
against attacks tends to work against an

600
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,490
inventory against best practice now that

601
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:27,120
might be too hardcore for early-morning

602
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:29,610
but when you start to take all of your

603
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,610
controls all of the things that you have

604
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,649
your firewalls your you know all of your

605
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,810
patching your management solutions your

606
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,610
hardening your exploit prevention the

607
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,280
things that are going to see things on

608
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:44,070
the wire see it in flight see it locally

609
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,780
you know find artifacts of it when you

610
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,389
start to map all of those things out

611
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:51,330
against an attackers lifecycle you'll

612
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,730
start to see the holes when you map them

613
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:57,419
out against Gartner you will start to

614
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:00,750
see your money go away that's it there

615
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,880
is no damn sense and mapping it against

616
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,750
someone else's best practice because it

617
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,220
literally gives you zero coverage the

618
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,740
only thing that is going to give you

619
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,200
coverage is trying to identify where it

620
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,490
works in your environment otherwise

621
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,270
you're gonna end up in that whole life

622
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:21,060
cycle of just buy new all the time

623
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:22,770
which this happens and then security

624
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,120
programs are mad because like we need

625
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,730
more money because if we had more money

626
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,260
we would have stopped you know fancy

627
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,050
chicken and then you're like what we did

628
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,190
in and it's because of you mister you

629
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,310
didn't give me money and they're like

630
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,600
gone I given you 20 million dollars what

631
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,270
have you done with it and they're like

632
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,169
all those fenders suck but this new one

633
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:45,000
is the damn right that drives me crazy

634
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:47,820
so if we can start doing some of this

635
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,740
stuff to say why didn't it work where

636
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,100
didn't it work how didn't it work we can

637
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,380
use stuff like attack to have a common

638
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,290
language around saying this is what your

639
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:02,010
tool did not do right I mean

640
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:06,690
I'm a huge problem but just in general

641
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:08,250
thanks mom but yeah but but no I'm a

642
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,980
huge part of the problem in the fact

643
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:14,040
that I have had tons of time in my life

644
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,730
doing research doing demos showing

645
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,909
things just being a wank against they

646
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,310
thought virus all right hey you walk by

647
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,070
it every single time all the time lol it

648
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,720
does nothing okay that's a terrible way

649
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,939
to talk about it because does do things

650
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,340
what I'd learned through trying to

651
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,230
measure a baseline was that I was

652
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,149
finding out that it was not doing the

653
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,310
things I expected it to do and then I

654
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,750
could feed back to those AV vendors and

655
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,860
feed back to those different solution

656
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,770
vendors here are the different

657
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,540
techniques that you are not catching and

658
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,100
it was amazing that instead of just

659
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,810
walking up to them and being like hi you

660
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,730
suck I just walked by you again and

661
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,440
giving them just a list of things where

662
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,720
they can go look it up how fast that

663
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,160
 got fixed like they actually cared

664
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,650
I mean they also want to stay in

665
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:03,240
business so who knew but but we can do

666
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,440
that right we can do that and then once

667
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,960
we do that we can do it for our own

668
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,050
environment we can figure out what we do

669
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,060
well in the attack chain what we do well

670
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,430
against attackers with and what we don't

671
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,440
do well because measuring our blind

672
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,660
spots is going to help us measure then

673
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,960
what we can succeed at doing right

674
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,980
measuring success sometimes is very hard

675
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,740
in a giant enterprise right how many

676
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:33,200
times did I succeed in this electronic

677
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:36,570
thing that has 65,000 535 ways to do it

678
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,820
over a million other different transport

679
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,470
mechanisms right that's super hard but

680
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,560
if we can get to a baseline like this

681
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,930
maybe we can make some measurement so

682
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm trying to get to a point where we

683
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:51,540
figure out telemetry I don't really know

684
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,560
how to do it yet again I think that it's

685
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,560
something that all of us need to

686
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,120
consider of can you get telemetry out of

687
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:00,530
your own environment can you get

688
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,629
something better than the Box is on

689
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,668
right and then next step can you get

690
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,129
something better then

691
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:10,229
a designer graph then can I get

692
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:12,809
something better can I can I get to a

693
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:15,209
point where I know today works the same

694
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,940
as yesterday or tomorrow works the same

695
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:20,159
as today and I think that's a hard

696
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,259
question I don't I don't really have a

697
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,879
good answer for that I can tell you that

698
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:26,429
through doing some of the measurement

699
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:29,218
that we have we figured out some really

700
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:30,989
bizarre stuff you know just running

701
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:33,570
those tests every single day and

702
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,519
instrumenting those cases we've gotten

703
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,189
to the point where I could tell you when

704
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,929
dat files and AV was bad and I was

705
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,299
telling it like that morning I could be

706
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,159
like hey I'm doing the follow the Sun

707
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,649
I'm transferring over to my other

708
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,389
defender teams we run a hundred test

709
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:50,008
cases through the environment we

710
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:51,508
automatically inspect the logs to make

711
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:54,059
sure that those things got caught that

712
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:57,749
got caught yesterday and magically like

713
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,979
20 of them are gone and then we have to

714
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,499
go aha

715
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:03,989
really so I can't transfer my defense

716
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:05,459
today because my systems aren't working

717
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:08,070
is there a log folder down is there

718
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:09,719
something else down oh no no the vagrant

719
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,599
that we were running on caught an AV

720
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:15,450
update and now it's just completely

721
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:19,379
blind to all this stuff now how many

722
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,849
people know that and I don't know I did

723
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:22,228
not know it until the day it happened to

724
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:24,749
me and I was like oh this is

725
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:26,489
probably a big problem but I don't know

726
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:28,529
how to fix it yet so I think these are

727
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:30,359
some other things that I asked right how

728
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:32,070
can we start to get an idea of

729
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,478
fluctuation how can we understand

730
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,979
expansion and contraction in our

731
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:37,139
environment how can we understand

732
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:38,639
coverage how can we get to a point of

733
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:41,008
understanding the difference between

734
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:43,228
detection time remediation time dwell

735
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:46,139
time eradication time all of those

736
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:47,700
things come with a whole ecosystem of

737
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:51,958
testing and performance and telemetry

738
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,279
that I don't see any tools doing but I

739
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:55,799
think it's going to be the foundation of

740
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,109
how we get further in the future so it's

741
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,739
another question please if you got the

742
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:03,529
answers go do it the world needs it I'll

743
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:05,759
help any way I can

744
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:09,299
we have other weird things that I don't

745
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:13,909
understand I mean I understand them for

746
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:17,889
myself right there's some real strange

747
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:19,900
like egos and and crazy chests

748
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,200
puffing weirdness that happens in our

749
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,640
industry that I totally don't understand

750
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,380
especially from just you know a whole

751
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,380
bunch of I mean I get it like the like

752
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,350
oh I came as a bullied nerd and now I

753
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:35,470
can bully you back with the computers

754
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,850
I felt that before but but there's all

755
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,740
these different faces I think that

756
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:41,110
people are required to wear an InfoSec

757
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,600
sometimes like the you know InfoSec jerk

758
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:46,090
on Twitter or the InfoSec person who

759
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,639
does this or does that versus just the

760
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,929
who you are at home and I think that

761
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,910
sometimes that that creeps into our

762
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:56,590
office a lot where it's the and I get

763
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,180
how it happens to us right someone else

764
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,250
puts the mask on us sometimes it's like

765
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,950
the asshole security person who tells me

766
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,050
no to everything like okay I get that if

767
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,910
somebody else constantly told me no

768
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,739
which they did I just learned how to get

769
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:11,560
around it but not everybody else takes

770
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:12,969
it that way so I think it's one of those

771
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,360
issues that we have to start figuring

772
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:19,000
out is how do we exist in a world where

773
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,120
we're here all on the same team whether

774
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,460
it's the pen tester red teamer offensive

775
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,199
person or blue fat blue person or

776
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,149
somebody in the middle or management

777
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,850
like all three of those people and those

778
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,168
teams are totally together in the same

779
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:35,049
goal because if they weren't they would

780
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:37,658
be doing other like I can tell you

781
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,240
right now I would not choose a life of

782
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,360
flying around and not being super rich

783
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,100
if I didn't care about it

784
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,770
what did shoes I wouldn't choose just

785
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,989
hanging out and talking I would go and I

786
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,639
would be mega loaded on the black hat

787
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:53,290
side I wouldn't give a

788
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,779
I will go pave companies I would sell

789
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,610
 all day long I mean as easy it as

790
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,530
it is to like go scan for sequel

791
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:03,460
injection somewhere and dump credit

792
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:06,280
cards I'd have a empire but I

793
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,690
don't because I really truly want to do

794
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,550
the job that I'm doing and I have a

795
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,990
feeling that all y'all are here because

796
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,040
I mean there's maybe a couple people who

797
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:18,520
are like I'm black as long

798
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,320
but that's fine I just I just think that

799
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,870
that some of those masks that we wear

800
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,190
end up defining us in some very

801
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,460
different ways than we need to be

802
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,460
defined

803
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:36,160
I don't even this next that slides like

804
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,720
an eye chart it's it's it's the worst it

805
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,370
is the worst tweet I've ever seen in my

806
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,560
whole life or Facebook post or whatever

807
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,750
it came from it was like someone who's a

808
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,720
pen tester who's like I need a job now

809
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:50,770
I'm not joking I need a real job and I

810
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,649
was like oh my god like first off well

811
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:59,080
yeah it's just all cap and I won't move

812
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:02,140
I'm I need RS use yeah I wanted to just

813
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,170
I would have taken the cuffs just a

814
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,060
punch that dude in the face I would have

815
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:12,220
been like for the community Wow and I

816
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:14,320
laid them out I have a little bit of

817
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,430
money to get out of it but not I would I

818
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,810
would start a Kickstarter I mean like

819
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:21,970
help me punch this dude and it would

820
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:24,340
instantly get funded all right so I

821
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:27,250
don't know how to fix this problem I

822
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:29,200
think that just you know this this

823
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,090
Eckhart Tolle quote makes sense to me

824
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,529
because as soon as we recognize it it's

825
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,660
no longer really there it doesn't

826
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,030
necessarily have the power but I think

827
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,799
again it's not something that I'm even

828
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,210
though that's so ironic I'm barking at

829
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,170
other people you can't bark it at other

830
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,550
people but you you can't really tell

831
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,780
somebody else to do it you just have to

832
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,940
kind of be aware of it yourself and if

833
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:52,270
you become that change then it happens

834
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,870
around you right Cheers

835
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,870
we did that wrong

836
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:06,790
I like that he's like still in it he's

837
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:10,329
like yeah alright so how do we fix that

838
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:12,460
one that one is a even larger problem

839
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:17,680
that I have no idea how to fix other

840
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:19,960
than you know doing more yoga I think

841
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,328
that the more that we're aware of it the

842
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,339
more it will help but again another

843
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:24,819
thing I'd like people to consider of how

844
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,319
do we do it

845
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:27,640
is it a checks and balances of the

846
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:29,859
people around us is it checks and

847
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,808
balances on herself is it both you know

848
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:34,058
do we make an app that says like you're

849
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:35,559
being an asshole pops up on the screen

850
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:37,089
and then you could be like I use

851
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,040
blockchain and AI to analyze your

852
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,720
language and give it to you know IBM's

853
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,670
Watson project so we can understand the

854
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,669
intent and then it's like man you suck

855
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:51,520
turn it off

856
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:54,790
god I feel like I was I had a project

857
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,140
for like four months and a really really

858
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,779
really big order does anybody working

859
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:03,609
like a really big organization alright

860
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:06,910
so like do you have like like RSI guards

861
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:08,410
like like for like ergonomic things and

862
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,210
the thing would just yell at me it'd be

863
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:15,069
like you're typing too long and I'm like

864
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:16,540
my job literally only thing I do and

865
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:20,160
it's just like stand up and then I'm

866
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,160
like sitting my desk I'm like doing this

867
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,970
sorry that's I digress

868
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,250
what have I actually learned from all of

869
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:31,520
this so so I have a lot of questions but

870
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:33,200
I have learned some things so I'd like

871
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,470
to try and share some of the things that

872
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,220
I've learned which may not may not work

873
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:42,109
for anybody but somehow the pan hit me

874
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,080
in the face over and over again and I

875
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:49,640
learned some things the biggest one is

876
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:53,330
that security is a feeling it is not it

877
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:56,150
is not a thing that you do or don't do

878
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:59,870
in the English language the word

879
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:03,320
security is only a feeling it always

880
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:06,859
comes back to a feeling all right which

881
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,400
means that unless all of us are skilled

882
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,710
therapists we are not going to do our

883
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,080
job as best as it can be because we have

884
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,730
to manage other people's feelings we

885
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,830
don't just have to manage their firewall

886
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,120
we don't just have to manage we caught

887
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,860
the person didn't catch the person or

888
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,290
whatever else we actually have to manage

889
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,270
the feeling of all of the people we

890
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:30,009
interact and work with in order for them

891
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:32,380
to actually feel secure

892
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,300
don't know why that came out maybe it's

893
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,510
because I live in Colorado but it just

894
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,420
happened right and the more I started to

895
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,490
focus on how were my actions or how was

896
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,960
the way that I was posing data or the

897
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,879
way that I wrote a report the way that I

898
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,290
wrote a narrative in something how was

899
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,150
that affecting the feelings of the other

900
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,670
people that were reading it or consuming

901
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:54,880
it and the more I got attached to that

902
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,460
and the more I connected to that the

903
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,630
faster and more diligent I saw people

904
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,450
starting to get to a point where they

905
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,030
felt pretty good they felt pretty secure

906
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,950
I loved I mean my favorite story that I

907
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:11,320
feel like I've told a billion times is

908
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:13,839
that we were doing this pen test and I'm

909
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,089
in the middle of it and I get a call

910
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,400
from another client and I'm like oh man

911
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:21,009
you know is someone there's something

912
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,380
going on something bad and they're like

913
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:26,200
yeah well my guys are all in the data

914
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:29,170
center right now and they're frantically

915
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,210
patching stuff they have all this stuff

916
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,410
lit up and turned on doing full packet

917
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,300
analysis also the and I'm like

918
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,629
what's going on and they're like well

919
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,520
one of them saw that one of your guys

920
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:42,280
tweeted about finding a restaurant in

921
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,920
our city so they just figured you guys

922
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,609
were here doing a pen test and I was

923
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,560
like I'm not there he's like I know

924
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:56,098
you're not there and I was like are you

925
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:59,589
going to tell them he's like oh no no

926
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:03,579
best part the absolute best part of it

927
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:06,609
is within minutes after that call I get

928
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:10,000
a text message with a screenshot that

929
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:11,560
says weaksauce and it's a picture of

930
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,829
someone taking a picture of the screen

931
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,650
and this like really bad jail dropper

932
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:21,069
that's like in the root directory of a C

933
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:24,869
Drive somewhere and and it was one of

934
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:24,869
their I are people talking to me

935
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,740
and they're like whatever you just suck

936
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,740
try harder

937
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:42,730
okay what the feeling is what made it

938
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:45,130
good right like they felt so strong that

939
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,240
they were ready to take the person that

940
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,829
they wanted to kick out of the room the

941
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,598
first time that they saw the test and

942
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:51,220
now like talk to me to the point

943
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,150
where I would give up and I was like

944
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:59,049
small tears coming down my eyes proud

945
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:01,329
right hard work

946
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,339
is something that I think has been bred

947
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:10,119
into me as much as it doesn't look like

948
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:13,000
it but there's lots and talented people

949
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,680
in our industry like lots it's the

950
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,400
people are so damn smart I feel like an

951
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,950
idiot pretty much all the time but the

952
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,290
one thing I do know is that a lot of

953
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:25,000
those people who are super smart end up

954
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,190
coasting on being super smart and then I

955
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,540
just outwork them I'm like okay well you

956
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,680
figure that out in five minutes you're

957
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,210
awesome and they're like yeah I'm

958
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,040
awesome then they go out for you know

959
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,089
six hours being like I'm awesome and

960
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,619
doing the chant like walking around the

961
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:37,509
city and then like I get the job done

962
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,410
because it takes me like four hours to

963
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,770
figure out what they figured out in five

964
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,420
minutes

965
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:45,359
but then I had the extra two hours to

966
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:47,470
get better so I'm all for working hard I

967
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,069
think I've talked about that plenty

968
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:52,828
I think bless you I think we just have

969
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:56,200
to be the change that we want to see

970
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:59,050
right I mean all of these things won't

971
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,480
really matter unless one of us do it and

972
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,369
if one of us does it then that is a

973
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,050
measurable percentage and if we get back

974
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:06,579
to our measurement the more people that

975
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,900
do that the more we can measure the more

976
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:10,200
we can show that it's succeed and

977
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,200
improved

978
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:16,870
I learned this one the hard way two

979
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:19,030
divorces because of InfoSec it's not

980
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:21,460
it's not a good look it's not a good

981
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:24,340
time to tell people like man I've been

982
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,380
working so hard that I forgot about

983
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,480
everything else cuz all of us need some

984
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,370
type of support system whether it's

985
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,590
friends whether it's family whether it's

986
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:34,779
our dogs it's totally my family and dogs

987
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:38,500
like they're the same thing

988
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:41,950
I mean I'm gonna fly home today so I

989
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,870
could go see them but at the same time I

990
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,730
think that we got to make sure that we

991
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,220
have a good life balance of that because

992
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:52,180
the only way that I personally learned

993
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:55,299
to get really recharged was having that

994
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,580
thing outside my support system where I

995
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,590
came in and I went through the you know

996
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,000
the pentester rollercoaster of like you

997
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,620
know the first day where I'm like haha

998
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,300
there's bones everywhere and then by

999
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,710
like the third day I'm like I totally

1000
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,920
suck I should go into pre-sales

1001
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,480
and then like you know by Friday I find

1002
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,750
something I'm like hey yeah I got a show

1003
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,970
what's up and the test is over

1004
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:19,630
and you know like that's pretty much

1005
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:23,230
been my life for last ten years or more

1006
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,640
I guess ten years this company and the

1007
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:27,550
only thing that really recharges me is

1008
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,950
is the people that I love are things

1009
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,830
around me that that that truly have that

1010
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:36,129
back care that bounces back so take care

1011
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:38,470
of them giving to people giving to

1012
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,900
anyone giving to the community I think

1013
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,879
it's a good move a lot of people are

1014
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,860
really selfish and I think that the you

1015
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,360
know as I said when I opened I think

1016
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,640
that the reason that this community

1017
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:51,370
became what it was and that these events

1018
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,200
came what they did is because everyone

1019
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,910
gave something whether it was coming

1020
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,299
here to give your time or give your

1021
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:00,700
snarky criticism whatever it is give it

1022
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,050
you'll get some back now granted if you

1023
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,910
give a whole bunch of start I hope

1024
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:05,410
people give you back otherwise

1025
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,000
you're a bully and then I'm happy to

1026
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,710
publicly say something to you about it

1027
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,620
and then we could bully each other and

1028
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,570
then become friends afterwards but

1029
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,080
really try and try and try and take that

1030
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:18,650
into mind

1031
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:20,060
public and private you don't need to

1032
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:24,230
tell everybody when you're on

1033
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,850
Twitter you don't need to do that I mean

1034
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:27,650
I get it it's nice when everybody's like

1035
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,509
cool what size is it what's diameter

1036
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,010
like what's color like did you do

1037
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,650
analysis on it to understand your fiber

1038
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:35,180
intake and that could lead some great

1039
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,800
conversations but like do it to those

1040
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,600
people who really really need it and

1041
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,400
then for the other stuff like keep some

1042
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,259
things personal keep some of them

1043
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,240
private they'll haunt you later trust me

1044
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,060
I have some that really really

1045
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,279
haunts me and I wish someone would have

1046
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,640
told me this more emphatically when I

1047
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,280
was young but it's okay I think that you

1048
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,690
know all of us have a way to resolve

1049
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,970
some of those things in the future so

1050
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:04,670
just try and take it into account this

1051
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:06,500
one kills me all the time to remember

1052
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:09,080
who you are and not who they told you to

1053
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,540
be right like especially when when I get

1054
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,190
these like he's your worst nightmare you

1055
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,920
know it sounds like some really really

1056
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,840
bad B horror movie when somebody is

1057
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,850
talking about stuff we're like go break

1058
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,040
in your building or like come fix my

1059
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:25,430
credit report or whatever ridiculous

1060
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,140
 people say to me right but but I

1061
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,879
think a lot of times when when people

1062
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,950
have some of those expectations even

1063
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,810
though they may not seem negative or may

1064
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,399
not seem to become part of you at the

1065
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,170
time once you hear them over and over

1066
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,210
again like sometimes we take those

1067
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,310
things into our personality so I think

1068
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:42,830
that we just have to to go back to that

1069
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:44,840
core remembering of of who we really are

1070
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,790
in the world who we want to be versus

1071
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,740
necessarily who everyone tells us what

1072
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,150
we are what we you know you're the no

1073
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,500
person from security I'm like the only

1074
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:59,770
yes person from security you're just

1075
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:59,770
doing stupid you're right it's me

1076
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:06,680
which leads me to you don't have to be a

1077
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:10,399
bitch to be successful you don't you you

1078
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:13,190
this this is one of my big gripes with

1079
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,130
most of a lot of what I see and the like

1080
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,390
Twittersphere InfoSec thing not to say

1081
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,070
that there isn't good parts because I'll

1082
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,600
tell you I'm looking at it right like

1083
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:23,390
it's there

1084
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,940
but I think a lot of people tend to get

1085
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,620
this like one-up like I'm going to climb

1086
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,190
the ladder by stepping on the necks of

1087
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,430
my enemies you know like that it's not

1088
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,920
Conan

1089
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,379
like like let's have a little bit of

1090
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,240
elegance in what we do like we can all

1091
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,520
come up together there's there's

1092
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,410
literally negative unemployment in our

1093
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,240
industry like we don't need to smash

1094
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,589
anyone in our industry in order to get

1095
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,229
ahead even the people who are the

1096
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:50,600
absolute worst at it like we could give

1097
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:52,970
them a little bit of time and like help

1098
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,700
them come up with us and maybe we'll

1099
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:57,919
just make the bottom suck less like the

1100
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,169
top may not extend anymore we may have

1101
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,300
the smartest people that exist ever in

1102
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:04,640
the history of InfoSec they may they may

1103
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,610
be there but that means that the

1104
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,470
averages will never change right like

1105
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,810
let's at least pull some people up from

1106
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:16,220
the bottom instead of just trying like

1107
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:19,090
smite them out of the industry no

1108
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:22,129
feeding the trolls we all know that yeah

1109
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:25,460
I've had tons of problems with that in

1110
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:28,850
my life I've learned the very very very

1111
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:32,690
hard way that doing that leads us to

1112
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:34,520
know love being a potential student I

1113
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,440
think that's something that all of us

1114
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:42,290
can do better I know I need to do it

1115
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:44,180
better this one's hard I think it's hard

1116
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:49,000
just because a lot of times people

1117
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:51,680
expect us to kind of measure and judge

1118
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,960
but but a lot of times we don't educate

1119
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,240
enough people after that you know this

1120
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,780
control failed why did it fail because

1121
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,649
of technical like okay now what you're

1122
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:07,780
like I gotta go you're av didn't catch

1123
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,780
me alright what I do I don't know

1124
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:13,859
okay III think that you know some of

1125
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:16,109
these things can be solved we just have

1126
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:20,460
to make a mental note to solve some of

1127
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:22,470
them please ask for help it's the only

1128
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,390
way that I learned how to do any of the

1129
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,118
things that I learned today because I

1130
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,499
didn't have a mechanism for you know I

1131
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,019
couldn't go on the Internet

1132
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:32,669
it wasn't there you know I could I could

1133
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:34,709
like dial into somebody else's bulletin

1134
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,999
board and they would just punt me and

1135
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,109
then I had to learn how to get back on

1136
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,578
and once I would get back on they'll be

1137
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:40,788
like oh you found how to get back on

1138
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:42,960
like here's a book don't suck anymore

1139
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:45,210
okay and I'd go read it and then I would

1140
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,499
get everything wrong and then I would

1141
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,609
ask more people for help and they would

1142
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:49,950
tell me that I sucked but then they

1143
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:54,058
would still help me which I appreciated

1144
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:56,368
because like kept me grounded but but I

1145
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:59,220
think that asking for help whether it's

1146
00:49:56,369 --> 00:50:01,799
you know to the mental health stuff

1147
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:05,598
whether it's how do I do this whether

1148
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:09,779
it's I'm starting a business or I'm

1149
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,089
lauded as the best of wha-wha-wha and I

1150
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:14,039
don't want to say this to anybody

1151
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:16,410
because like they're gonna figure out

1152
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,869
I'm an impostor alright all of us have

1153
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:21,118
those situations and especially when

1154
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:22,970
we're always looked up to as the tell us

1155
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,450
how this thing works security person

1156
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:28,709
right we can still ask for help we can

1157
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:30,269
still ask for help around the community

1158
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:31,559
we can ask for help for people who are

1159
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:34,019
just as dedicated as everybody in this

1160
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:35,640
room to go like oh hey I have a secret

1161
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:38,008
like TLDR don't tell anybody

1162
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,690
but like I don't understand how TLS

1163
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:41,400
works like what you know and then the

1164
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:44,430
person who you're an idiot but here

1165
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,869
check this out like like a lot of times

1166
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,058
the people who are really good at it if

1167
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:49,980
they're actually good by the way if you

1168
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:53,519
go and ask somebody who's supposed to be

1169
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:55,559
the expert of how do you do this and

1170
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,508
they blow you off like you're just not

1171
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:02,339
cool enough to learn it's because they

1172
00:50:57,509 --> 00:51:05,039
suck at it fact absolute all the way

1173
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:08,640
across the board fact if you go to

1174
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:10,380
someone and you say hey I saw your talk

1175
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,269
that looks super cool how do I do this

1176
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,630
stuff and they're like Brian got no time

1177
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,569
for that

1178
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,549
like they just suck in their talk suck

1179
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:20,069
don't worry about them anymore it's like

1180
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:21,220
the five second investment you can spend

1181
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:24,509
to get them out of your life

1182
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,509
go to somebody who actually gives a

1183
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:32,650
get hobbies I I'm telling this to myself

1184
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:36,640

1185

1186
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,170

1187
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:44,169
pounding away at stuff I mean I've my

1188
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:50,140
couch has spent so many long ignites

1189
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:53,140
with me working not couching not

1190
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:56,020
couching not watching movies or doing

1191
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:58,060
just me just working in a different part

1192
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:59,410
of my house and pretending like I had a

1193
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,820
hobby I'm like oh look at this I'm in

1194
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,700
this room that has all this other stuff

1195
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,470
in it I'm not looking at that and typing

1196
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,279
like what are you doing Chris go outside

1197
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:08,230
yeah I'm outside

1198
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:12,640
you know like I'm in the grass in the

1199
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:16,750
yard typing none of you are probably as

1200
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:19,540
bad as that so it's just a warning get

1201
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:23,020
sleep I say that after I hadn't slept

1202
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:24,700
last night it's it's a real thing like

1203
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,050
you people you're humans you really do

1204
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,580
need to sleep I get that we're all like

1205
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,119
you know Voltron we don't need to sleep

1206
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,848
I'm a robot

1207
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:33,130
a hack all the things you know but but

1208
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:35,260
try and try and get some like if you

1209
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:37,570
can't like you have to figure out how to

1210
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:40,000
quiet your mind enough because at least

1211
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:44,109
for me I know at night the reason I

1212
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,790
don't sleep is I don't sleep because the

1213
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:48,009
bones it's like the clowns right like I

1214
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:50,109
just don't sleep I sit there and I'm

1215
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:52,630
just thinking of like oh what did I miss

1216
00:52:50,109 --> 00:52:54,310
or oh that sounds cool I didn't mess

1217
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:56,290
with that yet I'll do that tomorrow and

1218
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:58,529
then I sit there and I'm like it's

1219
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:00,300
almost immoral

1220
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,770
it's pretty close tomorrow and I like to

1221
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,150
look at my phone and then all of a

1222
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,950
sudden like I'm staring at my phone I'm

1223
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:07,050
reading about stuff and then I get all I

1224
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,359
get like super juiced up and I gotta get

1225
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:11,790
up it's it my dogs

1226
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,560
yell at me and bark and my wife stares

1227
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:16,820
at me she's like what are you doing I

1228
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,820
don't know I'm sorry I blacked out

1229
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:26,280
having faith it doesn't mean in anything

1230
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,590
other than faith right I believe in you

1231
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,800
the potato believes in you I believe in

1232
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:34,050
the potato like if we all have that type

1233
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,390
of faith we'll be able to climb the

1234
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:38,040
mountain of dish it'll never be secure

1235
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,259
we'll be able to laugh at all of the

1236
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,050
vendors who are like it keeps getting

1237
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:46,140
worse the sky is falling every time we

1238
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:48,720
lost three billion records who gives a

1239
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,368
 we lost them they're gone right

1240
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,709
like at some point you have to be like

1241
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:55,740

1242

1247
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:10,640
have the faith sometimes just a little

1248
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:14,220
bit of faith with the people around you

1249
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,569
will make them change the world even if

1250
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,629
you can't on the days where you're

1251
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:21,000
exhausted and you cannot afford in your

1252
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,420
soul to change the world that person

1253
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,700
next to you all they might need is like

1254
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:28,619
alright I'm tapping out to you you have

1255
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,649
to save the Internet today I'm gonna

1256
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:35,550
sleep and they're like what be like you

1257
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,810
got this potato and then and then and

1258
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,599
they don't know what you're talking

1259
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,710
about 20 minutes later when you leave

1260
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:41,190
they're like I guess I gotta save the

1261
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:45,330
Internet

1262
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:46,950
you know like it doesn't work but the

1263
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,690
times that it does work you'll be really

1264
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,348
stoked in the times that it doesn't work

1265
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,349
it'll just be normal

1266
00:54:53,450 --> 00:55:01,140
so I can leave you with this I think

1267
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:05,059
that conferences like this the amount of

1268
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:08,160
time and heart and care and passion and

1269
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:11,609
interests and curiosity that all of you

1270
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:14,879
put in is the reason that conferences

1271
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:17,700
like this work it's the reason that our

1272
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,670
industry gets pushed forward in a time

1273
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:23,669
where people can't even pull it I think

1274
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:26,130
that it's on all of us to keep that

1275
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:29,430
environment to keep that level of

1276
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:31,680
passion to keep that level of support of

1277
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:37,649
each other that when people are tired at

1278
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:40,440
the desk let them sleep when they need a

1279
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:43,619
little bit of help when they have a

1280
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,799
question try and answer it try and be

1281
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:48,599
excellent to each other

1282
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:50,099
don't just be the other person that's

1283
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:53,069
sitting there at the table who's a

1284
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:54,569
stranger know that most of the people

1285
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:56,460
who are sitting right next to you have

1286
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:58,890
the same scars underneath your clothes

1287
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,480
that you do and that we're going through

1288
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:02,308
a lot of the same together

1289
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,680
and that even the complete and utter

1290
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:07,319
stranger and all sides of this room have

1291
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,618
something to offer and something to
