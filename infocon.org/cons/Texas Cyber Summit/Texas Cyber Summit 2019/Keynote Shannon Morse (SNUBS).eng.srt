1
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,920
so as you can tell I came from this

2
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,620
background that had absolutely no

3
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,890
technical knowledge of networking or

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,559
security and privacy or even IT the most

5
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,750
I really knew was Hardware how to build

6
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,269
a computer and I knew how to play video

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,850
games like mist and fury three on my

8
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,340
computer and that was about it I played

9
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,890
a lot of console games and that's my

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,050
nerdiness like sci-fi culture and Star

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,910
Trek and stuff like that but when it

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,669
came down to security and privacy I

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,679
didn't know anything about it but for

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,280
some reason I'm up here giving a keynote

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,870
how weird is that I was always the kid

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,450
and I loved this picture my friend

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,520
actually drew this for me based on a

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,930
tweet that I had made on my my Twitter

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,690
account it says never make fun of the

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,460
kid who asks all the questions I was

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,310
once that kid and people thought that I

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,399
was stupid really though they were just

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,560
too embarrassed to ask the same thing I

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,690
found a lot of times whenever I was in

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,369
classes I was always the kid that would

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,289
raise my hand constantly and I would

27
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,910
just be like well I don't understand

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,500
this can you explain this more and then

29
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,039
some kid would laugh at me and it made

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,890
me feel terrible I felt so embarrassed

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,740
but after growing up in understanding

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,050
why I kept on asking those questions I'm

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,240
really happy that I did because I had a

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,700
really good foundational understanding

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,979
of those topics that maybe they

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,460
completely forgot and then I used the

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,980
test and they didn't so I continued

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,929
asking those questions especially when I

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:10,378
got on hack 5 and you can see that it's

40
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,810
working we have although these pictures

41
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:15,060
are kind of old so the numbers are a

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,680
little bit higher now we have five

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,349
hundred and fifty thousand subscribers

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,150
on hack five now and my personal channel

45
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:27,329
has about 17 thousand subscribers or so

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:30,180
so while the Shannon Morse channel is

47
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,159
somewhat small at 17,000 it's definitely

48
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,640
a far difference from hack five at five

49
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,959
hundred and fifty thousand that's huge

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,988
the reason I mentioned my personal

51
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,740
channel is because I've grown that an

52
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,230
additional four thousand

53
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,480
since May so I've had four thousand more

54
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,390
people subscribed in three months that's

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,280
pretty big that's a great platform to

56
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,720
start off with especially if you're

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,550
starting kind of late in the game for

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,670
your own personal self after working

59
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,080
with a company for ten years so there

60
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,470
was some reason that people kept on

61
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,910
coming to the content that I was

62
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,510
creating and I was trying to figure out

63
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:11,020
why so I'm completely self-taught right

64
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,239
I kept on asking those questions when I

65
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,520
started with hack five it was hard

66
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,460
because I didn't have that background

67
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,920
with security and privacy and whenever I

68
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:25,840
did ask those questions online the

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,510
answer that I always got was RTFM who

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,700
else has gotten that answer before yeah

71
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,220
it's so frustrating right it's so

72
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,100
frustrating especially if like man pages

73
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,650
are a great example so if you go to a

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,100
man page and the man page just assumes

75
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,360
that you already know the terminology

76
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,340
then you're not gonna get very far

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,040
trying to figure out what a command does

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,880
it's the same thing with RTFM when it

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,760
comes to independence insecurity InfoSec

80
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,230
or networking or IT it's very tough to

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,329
understand something if you don't

82
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,399
understand the terminology if you don't

83
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,620
understand the foundation so I just kept

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,780
on asking those questions when I didn't

85
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,060
get the answer I wanted I just kept on

86
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,500
digging in deeper because I'm the kind

87
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,710
of person who if I don't know something

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,350
I'm gonna figure it out I don't care if

89
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,930
people keep on telling me no or RTFM or

90
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,130
go somewhere else or they block me on a

91
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,430
forum because I asked you many questions

92
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,230
that happened I don't care I'm just

93
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,300
gonna keep on finding the place where I

94
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,670
can actually ask those questions and get

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,040
the answers that I needed given that

96
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,750
there weren't any very good tutorials or

97
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,840
at least I didn't find them at the time

98
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,820
way back in 2008 or in 2010 that

99
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,150
answered those questions that I needed I

100
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,640
kind of developed them for myself and I

101
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,620
figured out you know if I'm asking these

102
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,039
questions that probably means that

103
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,390
somebody else is too so I developed a

104
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,110
personal brand for myself

105
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,080
that was very approachable to anybody

106
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,509
that also had

107
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,210
questions so people could come to my

108
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:01,310
channel come to hack five or come to my

109
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,750
new personal channel and find the

110
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,800
answers that they wanted and actually

111
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,050
get a tutorial that didn't skip anything

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,610
so I've made that part of my personal

113
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,189
brand and for some reason it worked

114
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,680
so since then I've been invited to do

115
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,330
keynote talks like this one I've been

116
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,520
invited to do a talk at Dianna

117
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,830
initiative which was so cool highly

118
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,859
recommend going it's a great really

119
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,080
awesome informative convention that

120
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,060
happens during Def Con in Vegas it's so

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,650
cool especially if you like super tired

122
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,020
of being in the casino just go up to

123
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,859
their suite it's great so I've been a

124
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,979
keynote speaker

125
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,069
I've been influencing for brands like

126
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:44,780
way mo what I still don't know why they

127
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,310
invited me down there but I did a blog

128
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,150
and they really liked it so that was

129
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,479
cool I've been an extra in a Hollywood

130
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,299
movie does anybody recognize this movie

131
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,310
it's Jason Bourne yeah it's the most

132
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,110
recent Jason Bourne movie if you look at

133
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,000
the signage and I was only on screen for

134
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,909
a second so I'm not even credited I was

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,159
just an unspeaking extra but that's me

136
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:09,069
with the pink hair next to the signage

137
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:12,770
at the bottom and I'm directly below

138
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:15,339
signage for hack five a pineapple in a

139
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,339
rubber ducky

140
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:22,560
so who weird the born producers actually

141
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,750
went to DEFCON and they asked a whole

142
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,630
bunch of the vendors there will you

143
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,009
rebuild your booth for our movie and we

144
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,870
were like well what movie and I said

145
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,780
Jason Lauren and we were like yes yes

146
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,970
absolutely we will so we set up our

147
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,119
booth exactly like it was set up at Def

148
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:41,490
Con back in the Aria I believe it was

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,319
and then we spent the entire day they

150
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,509
paid terribly by the way they paid the

151
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,199
extras terribly but we set up a booth

152
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,509
and we had our stuff in the movie it was

153
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,919
so cool it was very interesting

154
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:59,099
Matt Damon was really nice so I've been

155
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,590
working with hack 5 for 10 years I went

156
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:04,020
from being somebody who was just another

157
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,330
drop in this huge YouTube and InfoSec

158
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,549
pool to somebody that people considered

159
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,430
to be a voice in the industry because I

160
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,500
found something that made me a personal

161
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,620
brand it made me notable I'm the person

162
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,120
that's approachable that anybody even if

163
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,889
you've never had any experience with

164
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,110
InfoSec you can go to my channel and

165
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,500
find the tutorials that work because I

166
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,090
don't skip anything even though the only

167
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,949
course I took in college that had

168
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,060
anything to do with programming was

169
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:35,190
JavaScript yeah I had no technical

170
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,639
background but yet I've been working

171
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,849
with hack 5 for 10 years I have no certs

172
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,650
except for a ham radio license cam 6 FTP

173
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:48,419
what so and I am well aware that the

174
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,969
address is public don't worry it's not

175
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:54,568
my house you can stop emailing me my

176
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:55,620
other address so I know it's on their

177
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:59,819
website it's fine

178
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,620
yay ham radio licenses but yes still

179
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,479
I've been working for this show for 10

180
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,840
years and I still have impostor syndrome

181
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,030
but I've built a personal brand I was

182
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,060
able to develop this personal brand that

183
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,549
enables me to get the jobs that I want

184
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,430
to turn down any of the ones that I

185
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,960
really don't want and to stand up for

186
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,300
people in our community that are

187
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,620
underrepresented especially in the

188
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,689
industry so I realized that I have this

189
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,399
personal brand a few years ago so I was

190
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,169
somewhat late to the game and it's

191
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,389
something that I developed kind of late

192
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:35,309
into my career but it's also something

193
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:37,799
that I feel like I fully understand now

194
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,018
it's something that I think is very very

195
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,299
important to build your own career in

196
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,670
this day and age especially with social

197
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,319
media because even hiring sprees

198
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,300
whenever your company is out and they're

199
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:49,889
looking for new hires they're gonna look

200
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,680
at your social media so you better have

201
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:55,980
a personal brand set up and I am here to

202
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,930
share my story with you as well as tell

203
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,819
you about how to be security conscious

204
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,930
while you're developing your own

205
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:06,449
personal brand it's important to know

206
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,359
what others perceive your personal brand

207
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:10,769
as because of course knowing what your

208
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
own personal brand is that's very

209
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,040
important but what if others don't

210
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,990
perceive your personal brand as the same

211
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,480
thing so I went on Twitter and I said

212
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,040
okay well what do you think my personal

213
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,230
brand is and of course I stuck a little

214
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,579
animated gifs on there or gif

215
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:31,230
sorry sorry I stuck an animated graphic

216
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:33,870
on there so that it would get more

217
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,069
algorithm favoritism on Twitter because

218
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,589
that's the way that Twitter works yay

219
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:39,719
graphics and I just ask people what do

220
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,660
you think my personal brand is so these

221
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,029
were some of the answers that I got anti

222
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,199
gatekeeper from my point of view I like

223
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,629
that answer that's cool

224
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:52,319
anti gatekeeper that's very approachable

225
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,819
right making a safer future it's hard to

226
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:55,319
see but there's a little trademark sign

227
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:59,550
right next to that that's cute

228
00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:03,180
I like that too smart AF with very I'll

229
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,920
say very cool hair so for the folks in

230
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,019
the back who are not as familiar

231
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,519
I usually dye my hair purple it's not

232
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,709
purple right now because dyeing it

233
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,809
professionally is really expensive so

234
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,790
I've just kept like not done it for like

235
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:18,180
a year but it's a thing

236
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,829
purple hair is a part of my brand I also

237
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,809
really like the message at the bottom

238
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,239
this is all from one person they said

239
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:27,149
sorry I know it may not be totally PC

240
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,180
but you're not a brand to me you are

241
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:32,069
Shannon at snugs you not my perceived

242
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,469
image of whatever's been put out there

243
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:37,290
as such I know my image is incomplete

244
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,900
growing dynamic and alive much better

245
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,140
that

246
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,360
they than a brand I actually really like

247
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,939
that answer because it creates

248
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,360
authenticity for myself and I agree with

249
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,280
him

250
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,900
you should be authentic you shouldn't

251
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,910
come off as something that's not you

252
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,640
because people will perceive that as

253
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:57,610
fake so the person at the end who

254
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,100
replied to my Twitter my tweet when he

255
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,110
said that he doesn't perceive me as just

256
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,880
something that's been put out there he's

257
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,190
correct because a part of my personal

258
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,000
brand is being authentic being my actual

259
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,620
self I also like this reply somebody

260
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,420
just tweeted Trinity and I was like I

261
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,730
mean who doesn't like Trinity right so

262
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,069
if they compare me to Trinity I must be

263
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,620
doing something right that's awesome

264
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,320
so it's important to understand how

265
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,910
people are perceiving you and understand

266
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,190
if you are being authentic when you're

267
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:30,339
putting your personal brand out there so

268
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,910
what is my personal brand so I think of

269
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:36,760
it as being approachable which makes

270
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,699
sense given my history with hak5 it's

271
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,600
informative that totally makes sense to

272
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,140
its passionate if anyone follows me on

273
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,700
Twitter

274
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,890
passionate and vocal kind of go together

275
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,030
together for me if you follow me on

276
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,490
Twitter you know that I'm extremely

277
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,010
vocal and I'm extremely passionate about

278
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,950
things that I care about so that totally

279
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,230
makes sense to me I'm authentic I'm

280
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,600
somebody that tries to come to you when

281
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,050
I'm introducing myself and what I'm

282
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,300
getting to know you as who I actually am

283
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,829
I don't put myself in front of a camera

284
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,770
on YouTube and try to be something that

285
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,470
I'm not because people will know that

286
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,579
you're trying to be fake so I always try

287
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,630
to be authentic

288
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm definitely weird that's a given and

289
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,870
I am really into Sailor Moon in

290
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:28,720
Starbucks I mean can you tell like

291
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,730
that's just I told my husband if we ever

292
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,370
move from the San Francisco Bay Area

293
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,380
where we currently live we have to live

294
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,180
near a target in a Starbucks because I

295
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,010
will not survive if we don't live near a

296
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,229
target in the Starbucks also a Sailor

297
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,360
Moon is great I mean these are Sailor

298
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,980
Moon high heels and I wear them every

299
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,540
single time I give a keynote and I think

300
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,800
of them as like my good luck charm so

301
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,959
yeah Sailor Moon

302
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,829
like Sailor Moon anybody yes come see me

303
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,099
after class

304
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,820
I'll give you a sticker seriously I have

305
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,350
stickers

306
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,000
therefore my Sailor Moon YouTube channel

307
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,839
because I do have a Sailor Moon YouTube

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,550
channel it's my thing okay so what is

309
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,070
personal branding we've answered the

310
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,859
question of how I developed my personal

311
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,519
brand it took a long time but I often

312
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,980
tist

313
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,660
on ascent eclis put myself out there so

314
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,690
that people come back and they they

315
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,120
follow me because they relate but what

316
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,820
is a personal brand well to start off it

317
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,570
is not a first impression it is very

318
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,839
very different

319
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,480
you can totally fake a first impression

320
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,329
it's in fact pretty easy to fake a first

321
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,240
impression I'm married so I don't really

322
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:39,910
go on first dates anymore but I've heard

323
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,860
about horrifying first or second dates

324
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,910
where people just put on this completely

325
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:48,490
different persona you can fake that

326
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,750
social engineering yay getting into a

327
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,480
place that you're not supposed to be in

328
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,820
that's always fine that's kind of giving

329
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,670
off the first impression of somebody

330
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:01,750
that you're not actually that you aren't

331
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,329
actually that's not actually you so you

332
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,470
can't really fake a personal brand

333
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:07,599
because you're putting your personal

334
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,610
brand out there every single day it's

335
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,079
something that you need to live by it's

336
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,120
something that you need to understand

337
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,870
and grasp so that when you put yourself

338
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,670
out there you two are authentic so my

339
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,430
first impression with hak5 was kind of

340
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,199
terrible and that's why I don't consider

341
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,819
it a part of my personal brand in fact I

342
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,180
wish that episode was not even on

343
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,070
YouTube anymore because it was so bad I

344
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,949
reviewed open source video games on my

345
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,110
first episode and it was so terrible at

346
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:37,390
the time I was very closed off I didn't

347
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,300
know what I was doing I had never done

348
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,800
anything on camera before no camera

349
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,740
works whatsoever so I was just like

350
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,209
hiding and crouching down and every time

351
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,110
I wanted to look at my notes you could

352
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:52,180
see me looking away from the camera so I

353
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,649
was like reading things and not even

354
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,300
looking at the people that are on the

355
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,770
other side of the camera in their

356
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,790
eyeballs what you should do when you're

357
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,100
presenting

358
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,900
it was so embarrassing so I felt like he

359
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,110
gave up this terrible first impression

360
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,449
and since then of course I've gotten a

361
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,100
lot more relaxed I'm still nervous of

362
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,950
course when I talk in front of a live

363
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,800
audience it's still really scary but I

364
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,750
have developed something of a personal

365
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,240
brand since then so that you kind of

366
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:23,230
forget and forgive my first impression

367
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,670
because it was bad so a personal brand

368
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,080
is made up of three different parts

369
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:31,719
perception reputation and uniqueness

370
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,690
first off is perception pay attention to

371
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,570
how other people perceive you so this

372
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,280
can change over time especially if you

373
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,370
get a better understanding a better

374
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,130
grasp of who you are as a personal or as

375
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,260
a person as you self reflect and you

376
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,140
understand yourself that's something

377
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,930
that you new kind of mature into over

378
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,120
time so you may be defined as something

379
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,099
that you didn't even realize you were

380
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,750
defined by that's why I asked that

381
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,790
question and on Twitter to kind of make

382
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,860
sure that people were seeing my personal

383
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,670
brand as exactly what I wanted them to

384
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,790
see it as something that I also wanted

385
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:12,490
to be your reputation your reputation

386
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,400
ties in very very closely to perception

387
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,320
so your reputation is basically what but

388
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,000
he'll do you want to die on is it

389
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,180
something that is really meaningful to

390
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,540
you what do you want people to relate to

391
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,239
what is your reputation to other folks

392
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,240
is it a popularity contest absolutely

393
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,790
not a personal brand is not just for you

394
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,100
know youtubers it's for professionals as

395
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,949
well it's all about building and

396
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,960
cultivating your uniqueness not somebody

397
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:47,980
else's not your company's it's about you

398
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:51,490
so to give you an idea of brands we have

399
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,900
Google Apple and Microsoft up here what

400
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,750
kind of words do you associate with

401
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:58,740
these actual companies these brands go

402
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,740
ahead and yell some out

403
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:07,950
big intrusive I like that blank screen I

404
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,190
like that too why am I using a Microsoft

405
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,930
computer something I think of is

406
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,960
surveillance

407
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:19,200
I think of closed ecosystem for at least

408
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,790
one of those obviously so there are

409
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,830
different words that you associate with

410
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,240
them and given that we're all different

411
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:27,359
people we've all had different

412
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,830
experiences all of our perceptions of

413
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,260
these different companies are going to

414
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,710
be somewhat different maybe you've never

415
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,870
worked with an apple machine so you have

416
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,010
nothing to relate to with them maybe the

417
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,290
only thing you've worked with is a

418
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,450
Windows machine so you can sing high

419
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,879
praises about Windows machines but Apple

420
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,100
you can't say anything about maybe it's

421
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,260
vice versa maybe you absolutely hate

422
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,449
Google for everything that they stand

423
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,910
for and you're just like Apple all the

424
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,450
way that's fine I'm not going to judge

425
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:00,210
you I'm an Android girl myself but I

426
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:04,250
started with Apple so I've been both

427
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:07,470
ways this is another example so my

428
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,660
perception of this brand is probably

429
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,180
completely different than your

430
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,550
perception of this brand probably

431
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:19,080
because I have worked with this one for

432
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:22,110
10 years so my perception I think of

433
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,760
this brand as being approachable as well

434
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,090
which is one reason that I stuck with

435
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,490
hack 5 for so long I think of them as

436
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:33,179
introductory informative

437
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:36,360
I think of hack 5 as being unique in

438
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:41,310
itself so should I ask what words you

439
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:43,620
associate hack 5 which tools hopefully

440
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,200
the good tools like physical tools not

441
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,340
like the people or tools

442
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,360
[Laughter]

443
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,480
so there's a lot of different ways you

444
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,840
can associate a brand with its own

445
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,510
marketing for example so your personal

446
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,669
brand is not just for influencers it's

447
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,070
not just for social media celebrities

448
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,860
but it's also for professionals and I

449
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,169
will tell you why as well but first let

450
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,820
me give you a couple of examples does

451
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,260
anybody know who this lady is

452
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,870
her name's on the screen so that

453
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,390
probably gives it away her name is aya

454
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,649
Justine she goes by Justine or I just

455
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,550
aim depending on where you look her up

456
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,380
but she has an excellent personal brand

457
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,750
she has a persona that she puts out

458
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,010
there it looks very authentic she's

459
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:34,790
bubbly she is the apple girl she's the

460
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,350
apple woman she's the apple person she

461
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,920
is the person that everybody associates

462
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,230
with Apple with iPhones she's the one

463
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,230
that everybody remembers as dancing in

464
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,030
an Apple store years and years ago and

465
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,220
that's really what set her off and what

466
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,080
created her personal brand so she's

467
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,510
stuck with it ever since then and you

468
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,980
never see her delve away from that

469
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,050
personal brand you never see her Dell

470
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,390
away from apples she's always talking

471
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,030
about that one thing here's another

472
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,970
example of a personal brand completely

473
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:08,240
opposite this guy his name is Logan Paul

474
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,580
I believe if you are into Japanese

475
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,930
culture like I am which is the reason

476
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,750
why I put that little Sailor Moon meme

477
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,820
up there like WTF then you probably

478
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,980
perceive his personal brand as somewhat

479
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,679
negative because of his past experiences

480
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:26,000
with Japan I will not get into it it's

481
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,620
very triggering here's another example

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,800
of a personal brand but for somebody who

483
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:34,520
is not a social-media influencer or a

484
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,680
youtuber this is Kate and Soros or quema

485
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,629
source she has her own Twitter account

486
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,700
her Twitter account has lots of

487
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,440
followers she owns her own company in

488
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,420
information security called Luda

489
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,300
security but she also has this very

490
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:50,180
strong background with bug bounties and

491
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,820
vulnerability disclosures she created

492
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,940
the whole subset of bug bounties so she

493
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,460
has this extreme passion for it and she

494
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:02,890
never delves away from that person

495
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:05,850
and it's very positive yes it showed up

496
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:09,309
good I was really happy about this one

497
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,719
BSI lab dia she's another excellent

498
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,820
example of somebody who is in

499
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,210
information security and has a personal

500
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,399
brand her personal brand goes into young

501
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,470
girls that want to get into hacking and

502
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,928
she follows this through and through if

503
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,549
you look her up online that's what she

504
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,289
talks about all the time and she is

505
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,330
extremely passionate about it and she's

506
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:31,000
extremely authentic because she lives it

507
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,428
every single day so she's a great

508
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,590
example of a personal brand another one

509
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:37,510
would be Jason Street if you listen to

510
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,610
tune yesterday you know that he has a

511
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,460
personal brand he's somebody who stands

512
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,199
up for folks that are not as represented

513
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,620
in the industry just like I try to do

514
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,049
he's somebody that is a hugger

515
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:54,459
definitely has anybody ever received a

516
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:56,559
weird hug from Jason me too they're

517
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:02,520
great and they're very consensual too if

518
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:04,990
anybody's asking so you should question

519
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,240
why should you care about personal

520
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,580
branding what's the point of it well you

521
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,960
can end up being an influencer in your

522
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,629
industry whether that's information

523
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,980
security security and privacy whether

524
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:19,779
it's restaurant work or hospitality or

525
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,029
anime culture or maybe you just want to

526
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,370
work conventions you want to be like a

527
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:27,399
full time owner of conventions which is

528
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,799
a thing you can be an influencer in

529
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:32,529
whatever your industry is you can end up

530
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,629
earning so much more money whenever you

531
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:37,149
are seen as an influencer or you are

532
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,370
seen as a leader so a lot of people are

533
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:42,189
very monetarily driven I mean like who's

534
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,719
not so of course you want to pay

535
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,700
attention to how much money you can

536
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,730
bring in if you develop a personal brand

537
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,070
behind yourself behind your goal you end

538
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,870
up having networking skills and you

539
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,330
create these meaningful interactions

540
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,729
with people because they come to you as

541
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,230
being somebody who is authentic and they

542
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,679
can believe you and they can relate to

543
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:05,110
you you end up owning your own life you

544
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,330
end up owning your own platform and you

545
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,979
take ownership of yourself and I will

546
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,029
delve into that a little bit further as

547
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,519
well and

548
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,710
Oh casing your own best self in front of

549
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:17,259
people too once you have more of that

550
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,419
confidence you understand your own

551
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:21,009
weaknesses and your own strengths when

552
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,840
you start looking into it and you start

553
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,700
self reflecting on your own personal

554
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,099
brand and you stand out from the

555
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,450
competition and from your peers as

556
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:33,070
somebody who should be seen as a leader

557
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,749
you end up building your tribe and I put

558
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,269
that in quotes because I prefer the term

559
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:39,399
community you end up building your

560
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:41,769
community of people who will stand up

561
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:43,418
for you if something happens they will

562
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,129
back you up if something negative

563
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:47,409
happens maybe you got fired from your

564
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:49,689
job or somebody's harassing you online

565
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:51,549
this tribe or this community of people

566
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,919
will back you up and they will support

567
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,658
you and they will be the ones that come

568
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,339
to you and say like hey my company is

569
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,769
hiring or hey I know this company is

570
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:00,399
hiring or hey that person is having a

571
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,739
bad day

572
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:05,439
just ignore them if you have trolls

573
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:08,139
which definitely happens you end up

574
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,479
establishing credibility and elevating

575
00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:13,269
your own social proof online as well as

576
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:16,269
offline to you solidify your niche

577
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,769
whatever your niche might be so if

578
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:19,869
you're looking at info suck is being

579
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:21,099
very broad you can niche that down and

580
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:25,178
find something that you are known for

581
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:27,339
like Katy does with bug bounties you end

582
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:29,320
up easily conveying your values in your

583
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:31,359
messaging into something that people

584
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,489
understand and you end up building

585
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,710
confidence so that you can end up

586
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:38,440
getting on a stage and presenting or

587
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,839
getting up in front of a conference room

588
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,519
for your peers or for your co-workers

589
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,320
and you can tell them about what you

590
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,599
care about because you're passionate and

591
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,580
you demonstrate value through your own

592
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,339
actions because you end up living this

593
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,399
every single day so let's talk about

594
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:56,469
building that brand also very very

595
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,908
important because how do you get there

596
00:24:56,469 --> 00:25:01,059
if you don't build it in the first place

597
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:03,669
it's just like building computers first

598
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,950
we should talk about security oh yes

599
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,749
because you should not build a brand

600
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,460
before you know and understand your own

601
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:12,309
security

602
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,320
trust me I know in fact I have a story

603
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:17,349
about this when I first started with

604
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,879
hack 5 of course again I didn't have

605
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,979
that background with security and

606
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:22,360
information technology and everything so

607
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:25,240
I kind of threw

608
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,800
myself into the deep end and my family

609
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,720
had no clue what I was doing so they

610
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,610
didn't really understand security and

611
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,040
privacy either because I wasn't sharing

612
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,439
that information with them one day my

613
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,750
mom called me and she said I got an

614
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,970
email from one of your fans they said

615
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,600
they logged into my photobooth account

616
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:47,110
or photo something account and they

617
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,780
figured out my password what Shannon was

618
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:57,310
like really mom you need to change that

619
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:59,980
she goes well how did they know how did

620
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,810
they know I will never get over that so

621
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,580
if you don't understand what your

622
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,350
security or if you don't understand what

623
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,580
your personal brand is and you're just

624
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,649
starting to develop it and you

625
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,300
completely forget about the part with

626
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,050
security and privacy then you could end

627
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:18,250
up being like Matt so Matt back in 2012

628
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:20,350
he's a journalist he got hot he ended up

629
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,360
getting several of his accounts taken

630
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,209
over and it was a really horrifying

631
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,000
experience for him it happened all at

632
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,610
once to quote this article which was on

633
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,260
I believe wired he said next my Twitter

634
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,600
account was compromised and used as a

635
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:37,180
platform to broadcast racist and

636
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,189
homophobic messages worst of all my

637
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,470
Apple ID account was broken into and

638
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,010
hackers used it to remotely erase all

639
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:47,320
the data on my iPhone iPad and MacBook

640
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,570
so he lost a lot of information and he

641
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,639
panicked it was a horrifying nightmare

642
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,470
experience for Matt the reason people

643
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,240
were tagging him is because he had a

644
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,590
very short twitter handle he had a

645
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,020
personal brand that somebody else's

646
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,179
wanted it was at m80

647
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,700
I believe but somebody wanted to take

648
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,770
that back over and in the meantime since

649
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,600
he had all of his accounts tied into

650
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:12,690
each other they were able to take over

651
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:15,340
everything else - yay convenience right

652
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,050
Jack Dorsey is another great example of

653
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,510
somebody who has a personal brand and

654
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:22,659
who has been attacked because well his

655
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:25,960
security was not as it should have been

656
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,970
however with that said I won't victim

657
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,280
blame here anybody can be a victim of

658
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,170
sim swapping sim swapping is something

659
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,040
that can easily be done with social

660
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,980
engineering with

661
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,629
as we all know and Jack Dorsey ended up

662
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,640
getting hit because he has a social

663
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,940
brand or a personal brand that people

664
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,820
were hating on people did not enjoy it

665
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,240
so they took advantage of his personal

666
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,800
brand him being out there so much and

667
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,420
they ended up attacking it which is

668
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,860
going to happen when you have a personal

669
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,450
brand and when you do build that

670
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,370
leadership and influence in your

671
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:03,190
industry so Marie Kondo who likes Marie

672
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:06,340
Kondo a few hands

673
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,860
I'm obsessed seriously watch her show on

674
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,040
Netflix it's great so personal branding

675
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,169
of course requires a little bit of

676
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,090
calming of your digital life I love

677
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,280
Marie Kondo in the fact that she tells

678
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,790
you about how to declutter your physical

679
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,440
space

680
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:24,310
she doesn't really ever talk about

681
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:29,140
digital spaces though and I like taking

682
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:31,330
her ideas and her terminology and kind

683
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,590
of sticking it with my digital brand as

684
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:38,439
well so I use the connery ideals and use

685
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,659
that towards my digital life so I do

686
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,360
things like I clean up old accounts that

687
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,760
I may not care about or have any access

688
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,850
to anymore I delete old accounts that I

689
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,680
don't use anymore or I go into accounts

690
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,969
and I just clean them up by you know

691
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,120
changing the password to something

692
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,100
that's extremely algorithmic complicated

693
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,040
like through whatever my password

694
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,510
manager is or I go in and I erase all of

695
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,310
my data about my shipping address

696
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,560
because they really don't need to store

697
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,480
that I can spend the next 30 seconds and

698
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:11,110
type in my address instead of having it

699
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:14,350
stored on another piece of software I

700
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,909
delete old tweets sometimes most of my

701
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,280
tweets are authentic and they're

702
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,230
actually me so it doesn't really matter

703
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,410
if they're up there but if it's

704
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,390
something like me drunkenly outgoing eff

705
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,800
everyone then of course I'm going to

706
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,420
delete that because that's not really

707
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,870
how I feel

708
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,990
Yolo

709
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,360
I'll delete that one I clean up my

710
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,029
friends list I make my friends looks

711
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,320
very very audited down to only other

712
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:41,809
people that I actually want to be

713
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,970
friends with sometimes now of course

714
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:45,710
that sounds really mean to say delete

715
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,929
your friends list you don't necessarily

716
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,640
have to do that but make sure that your

717
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:52,610
friends list is actually people that you

718
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,159
want to be associated with people that

719
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,990
if they go to your following list they

720
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,880
see folks that they also want to be

721
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,289
associated with folks that are positive

722
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,049
folks that bring something to the

723
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:04,190
industry declutter your digital life so

724
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,379
that you end up with something that

725
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:10,399
you're proud of and something that's

726
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:12,020
easy to maintain as well so I wrote this

727
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,559
thing called the 30 day security

728
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,539
challenge few years ago and while some

729
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,480
of the information is now 2 years old

730
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:23,059
it's still fairly accurate I broke down

731
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,460
security and privacy so that each day

732
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:27,889
has a different step for your platform

733
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,840
so it starts with simple things like

734
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,669
decluttering your digital life and goes

735
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,459
on to other things like setting up

736
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:36,830
two-factor authentication and encrypting

737
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,980
your computer's operating system and

738
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,809
stuff like that so that it's not super

739
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,760
super daunting to the point where you

740
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:45,710
just don't want to do it and every

741
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,230
single day is something simple that you

742
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,510
can spend maybe an hour to doing not

743
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,610
necessarily in 30 days straight but you

744
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:55,220
can break it down into easy concepts

745
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:57,469
that every day that's a goal by

746
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,320
following this and I do this about once

747
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:03,200
a year I end up creating my personal

748
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,418
brand online that's a lot easier to

749
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,190
maintain because I already understand

750
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:10,549
what my security and privacy is it's

751
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:13,370
much easier for me so you need to boost

752
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:15,440
your internet security so that you don't

753
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,320
end up being an easy target once you do

754
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,520
create a personal brand for yourself

755
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,770
another program that I wanted to mention

756
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,149
and this is from my personal account to

757
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,399
give you an idea of what it looks like

758
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:28,520
this is a website called joined elite

759
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,860
me.com and it's a little pricey per year

760
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,360
but once you get yourself out there and

761
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,010
you develop a personal brand it's kind

762
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,050
of important to make sure that your

763
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,120
information is deleted

764
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,909
anywhere that it should not be online so

765
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,610
white page websites any of those data

766
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:46,010
aggregators you probably want to get

767
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:49,159
your information deleted off of those so

768
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,840
this program joined delete me comm goes

769
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,970
through and deletes everything quarterly

770
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,770
or they send out opt-out requests for

771
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,170
you that way you don't have to do it

772
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,570
yourself you can go through all these

773
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:02,690
websites and do it yourself but I found

774
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,760
it to be a huge time waste so I signed

775
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,610
up for this website this paid service to

776
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,650
do it for me and it has saved me so so

777
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,439
much time I'm so happy that I signed up

778
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,910
for it so I wanted to mention that make

779
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,130
sure that you draw some kind of hard

780
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,380
line choose what you want to share and

781
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,880
what you don't want to share what do you

782
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,490
want to keep to yourself

783
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,520
what are you vocal about so some things

784
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,500
that I keep to myself include anything

785
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,450
that's medical I don't really talk about

786
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,330
health very much online especially

787
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:34,790
personal health I never ever talk about

788
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:37,040
family drama because nobody wants to

789
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:40,070
hear that I also never share anything

790
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,230
about personal finances now I will talk

791
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,020
about like my shows YouTube monetization

792
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,320
I talk about that I'm very open about

793
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,840
patreon platforms to use I'm very

794
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,399
authentic and vocal about fees that are

795
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,909
associated with running those kind of

796
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,890
things

797
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,000
so that people understand where their

798
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,340
money is going if they want to

799
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,460
contribute or they watch ads on YouTube

800
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,810
because because that affects people

801
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,910
however my personal finances don't

802
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,129
necessarily affect other people so I

803
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,780
don't talk about that online so make

804
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,090
sure that you know exactly what you want

805
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,330
to talk about and you draw that hard

806
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,040
line trolls and haters are another

807
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:20,689
really fun thing when you deal with a

808
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:23,810
personal brand you start to attract

809
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,830
attention I love this little Sailor Moon

810
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:30,409
meme haters gonna hate it's gonna happen

811
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:32,449
but understanding what your personal

812
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,020
brand is and developing it means that

813
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:38,270
you are going to attract attention oh

814
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:41,030
that's no fun once you start attracting

815
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,440
attention people will go online they'll

816
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,940
see you and maybe they don't agree with

817
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,110
you for some reason maybe you put

818
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,930
something out there that they don't

819
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,199
necessarily like they will likely attack

820
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,000
you for it because

821
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,059
people really like to hide behind their

822
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,980
computers and type on their keyboard and

823
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,539
pretend that you are not a person on the

824
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,480
other side of that computers they will

825
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:03,000
say whatever they want happens every

826
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,000
every single day for me especially on

827
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,730
YouTube but I know how I deal with those

828
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,379
trolls and those haters either I ignore

829
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,379
it depending on what it is

830
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:15,540
I will mute them or I will just straight

831
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:17,790
a block it if especially if it's sexual

832
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,940
harassment or anything that's based on

833
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,529
my gender or my identity I don't

834
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,359
tolerate it I block them immediately

835
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,359
choose how you want to deal with

836
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:31,040
harassment and stick with it make sure

837
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,619
that it's something that you you live by

838
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,440
also don't depend on social media social

839
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,679
media dependency obviously sounds like

840
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,450
us sitting on our phones constantly

841
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,849
checking Twitter taking Instagram

842
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:50,069
selfies and that's about it

843
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:51,899
hey hashtag selfie so of course that is

844
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,720
social media dependency but social media

845
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,149
dependency also talks about how you talk

846
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,310
to your tribe in your community how do

847
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:00,509
you keep in touch with people how do you

848
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,160
keep in touch with the people that

849
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,770
support you and the ones that want to

850
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,118
see your personal brand grow you want to

851
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,069
make sure that you are not just

852
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,589
contacting people through social media

853
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:11,250
because what happens if Twitter servers

854
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:13,680
go down

855
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,869
what happens if Facebook gets sued out

856
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,618
of existence which will probably never

857
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,660
happen unfortunately but what if it did

858
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,579
what if something happened to that

859
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,740
social media network where you keep in

860
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,230
touch with everybody you would have no

861
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,180
way to contact people after that and

862
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,339
then you would have to start growing

863
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,980
your personal brand all over again and

864
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:36,509
that's not going to be any fun so make

865
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,089
sure that you have a way to contact

866
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,119
people if something happened if

867
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,799
something blew up email is a great way

868
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,900
to stay in touch with people as well as

869
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:51,000
having their actual contact information

870
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:54,480
yeh signal so let's talk about personal

871
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,140
branding criteria criteria

872
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,970
this girl her name is lavender she makes

873
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,629
a youtube channel as well as an

874
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:05,490
Instagram she has a personal brand I

875
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,140
share her photo not just because she has

876
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,808
a personal brand that is very very

877
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,819
obvious she has this very lavender

878
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:15,089
aesthetic which makes sense given her

879
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:18,029
name all the time she wears white in all

880
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:20,490
of her images all of her YouTube videos

881
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,349
and she talks about lifestyle she talks

882
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,660
about positivity and self reflection

883
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,609
that is her brand that's her personal

884
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,319
brand and she lives by it but she also

885
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:30,058
created this video called how to make a

886
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,420
vision board in this blog post as well

887
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:35,430
now hers focuses on you know travel and

888
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,349
lifestyle how you want to create

889
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,210
yourself for the next year it's pretty

890
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:41,609
cute it's very nice especially if you

891
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,069
like to travel a lot which I do but I

892
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:46,078
think that you can use a vision board to

893
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:48,990
also help you develop your personal

894
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,510
brand you can start with asking yourself

895
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,790
some questions and create a list create

896
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,869
a Pinterest board if you want to you can

897
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,329
use wunderlist

898
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:59,730
you could use a Trello board I love

899
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:01,260
Trello it's great there's a bunch of

900
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,329
different ways that you can develop a

901
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,940
vision board for yourself of things that

902
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:08,250
matter to you that you want to include

903
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,650
in your personal brand what are your

904
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,299
core values these are questions that you

905
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,400
should ask yourself what are your core

906
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:17,579
strengths your amass skill sets your

907
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,190
weaknesses what do you like and where

908
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,170
would you like to go not necessarily

909
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,569
where would you like to go on planet

910
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:29,309
earth or if you're super optimistic off

911
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:30,750
of planet Earth Mars so that where Elan

912
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:34,640
musk is saying he wants to take us to

913
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:37,290
Mars so not necessarily outer space but

914
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,839
where do you want to go in your own life

915
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,609
what do you want to succeed at in your

916
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,400
own life that can also be included under

917
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:46,740
where would you like to go obstacles you

918
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,420
have overcome that's something that you

919
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:51,750
should consider what are your passions

920
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:55,109
and inspirations what really drives you

921
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:58,559
to be who you are what or who makes you

922
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:00,630
happy that's so important and also

923
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,480
there's a little thing that popped up on

924
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,170
my computer so I can't see my notes what

925
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,000
do you need in life

926
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,130
what do you want to achieve out of your

927
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,990
own life what will it mean to be

928
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,839
successful in the future

929
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,459
now I hate the question what do you want

930
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,779
to do in five years because that just

931
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,819
sounds like you're not already doing

932
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,960
what you want to do in five years it

933
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:22,990
also makes it sound like you're not

934
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,460
already being successful so I hate when

935
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,808
people ask me what do you want to be

936
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,220
doing in five years I'm like well I'm

937
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:28,900
already doing what I want to be doing in

938
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,649
five years so I'm happy I'm just gonna

939
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,720
make it cooler and better in five years

940
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,309
what is your personal and professional

941
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,919
training and experience what are things

942
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:41,349
that you can really help develop more to

943
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,150
help with that personal brand what makes

944
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:48,040
you unique compared to your peers what

945
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:51,430
qualifications make you stand out and be

946
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,990
different how do you help people what is

947
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,058
the thing that you bring to the table

948
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,020
that nobody else is bringing bringing

949
00:38:55,059 --> 00:39:01,390
what differentiates you you don't have

950
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,000
to be first and I feel like nobody is

951
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:07,210
ever first and information security but

952
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,780
you do have to be somewhat unique you do

953
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,880
have to be authentic your personal brand

954
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,829
is also about other people and how they

955
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,549
perceive you again that perception is so

956
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:20,200
important now when I say ask others you

957
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:21,549
may not want to go on Twitter and ask

958
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,140
them what do you think my personal brand

959
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:25,089
is because they may come back with some

960
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,618
really cruel things especially if you

961
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:29,049
don't know them or they don't actually

962
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:31,150
know you they might just attack you be a

963
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:32,710
targeted harassment so you may want to

964
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,420
start with people who will be honest

965
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,030
with you but you can trust like your

966
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,549
friends or maybe your family I would

967
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:41,049
probably not ask like my sister what she

968
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:43,540
thinks of me but I would ask my mom

969
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:46,299
because she would be honest to me but

970
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:49,839
she would be really kind about it - so

971
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:52,180
what do you mean to people how would

972
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,119
somebody defend you or talk about you

973
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,618
also what would they say about you if

974
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,390
you were not in the room with them

975
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:00,549
that's how you can really tell what

976
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:05,200
people think of you how would somebody

977
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:07,359
defend you what value do you create how

978
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,629
do you earn your place in their life

979
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,930
with you and how do they define who you

980
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,790
are as a person how do they perceive you

981
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,899
all of these are very very important

982
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,820
questions to ask when you're trying to

983
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,090
however other people perceive your

984
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:25,550
personal brand be very self-aware and

985
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:28,070
self reflect on what they say to you now

986
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:30,140
some of their answers may be or they may

987
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,210
sound critical they may sound like

988
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,980
criticism but hopefully it's

989
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,200
constructive and it's something that you

990
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,790
can build upon you can deepen

991
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,710
relationships in this way and you can

992
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,690
take advantage of what they say and you

993
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:44,270
can craft that narrative to be something

994
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:46,130
that is authentically you you can craft

995
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,230
your own personal brand and that's

996
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,580
exactly what you should be doing you

997
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,440
should be prioritizing the

998
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,200
characteristics that they give you and

999
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,720
the people who will help you to achieve

1000
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,819
your goals and take all of that

1001
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,549
information and create your vision board

1002
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,710
of your personal brand and make sure

1003
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,570
while you're doing that you avoid the

1004
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:09,830
people and avoid the things that will

1005
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:12,170
hold you back now this is an extremely

1006
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:14,270
important part and this is something

1007
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,250
that I wish I would have known when I

1008
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,530
first started with hak5 because people

1009
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,900
tried to develop a personal brand for me

1010
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:23,390
I didn't understand what my personal

1011
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,000
brand was so if you don't take control

1012
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:28,160
and manage your own brand others will do

1013
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,250
this for you and that can be a very

1014
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:35,029
scary concept if you don't take control

1015
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:38,000
of your own personal brand others will

1016
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:40,340
do it for you when I first started on

1017
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,130
hack 5 I did not have a personal brand I

1018
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,410
was a nobody in InfoSec people tried to

1019
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:48,440
develop a personal brand for me saying

1020
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,799
oh she's just doing hack 5 for the dudes

1021
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,120
she must be sleeping with her co-worker

1022
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,680
those were the kind of answers that

1023
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,710
people were giving me they were

1024
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,759
developing a personal brand as somebody

1025
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,160
who didn't know what she was talking

1026
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,810
about on my shows even though I had

1027
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,609
researched and I continued to research

1028
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,009
every single segment that I've done for

1029
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,990
thousands of videos since then they

1030
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,940
tried to come at it and say she's just

1031
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,830
in it for the dudes so they completely

1032
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,380
threw away the concept of having a

1033
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,490
female doing this hack 5 show even

1034
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,110
though I was really there because I

1035
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,720
wanted to learn and I wanted to share

1036
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,220
what I was learning so make sure that

1037
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,799
you take control of your personal brand

1038
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,759
early on so that nobody else can take

1039
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,760
control of it for you

1040
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,760
now there it goes okay that's an example

1041
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,650
of some of the things that I heard

1042
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,900
whenever I was starting with hak5

1043
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:42,450
people would say she doesn't know how to

1044
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:45,690
computer yeh Sailor Moon means why are

1045
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:47,460
you still loading so I wanted to give

1046
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,130
you an example here of some Instagram

1047
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:53,700
pages Instagram influencers are a really

1048
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:56,990
great example of how folks can build

1049
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:59,370
their personal brand online with okay so

1050
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:02,279
these are a couple of examples of

1051
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:04,470
Instagram influencers who have developed

1052
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,380
personal brands for themselves travel

1053
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,970
with Thalia and Kim Dell blog both of

1054
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,750
them while their personal brands are

1055
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,509
very visual

1056
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,880
these are personal brands the first one

1057
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,260
travel with Thalia she has these really

1058
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,360
pretty skirts and all of her pictures

1059
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,740
and they're very flowy and you see her

1060
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,800
as being this somebody who's very

1061
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,810
energetic somebody who travels a lot Kim

1062
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,240
Dao blogs she doesn't necessarily travel

1063
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,130
a lot but she takes beautiful landscape

1064
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,740
photos all of her pictures have this

1065
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:35,070
beautiful lavender touch to them very

1066
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,509
similar to lavender in a way she also

1067
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,040
takes a lot of food photos so you might

1068
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,990
think of her as somebody who is a foodie

1069
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,509
that's a part of her personal brand so

1070
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:45,060
you can develop your own visuals like

1071
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,800
purple hair purple is a big part of my

1072
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,840
brand hence the background on all of

1073
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,190
these slides and you can use that to

1074
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,650
your advantage you can put it on your

1075
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:55,500
business cards on your website visual

1076
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:56,910
cues help people remember you so having

1077
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,610
those kind of visual cues like

1078
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:01,529
instagramers for example can definitely

1079
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,140
help somebody remember you and call back

1080
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,730
to you when they're trying to find when

1081
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,870
they're trying to hire you for some

1082
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:11,730
future company so consistency is

1083
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,990
definitely important make sure that

1084
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,420
you're surrounding yourself with people

1085
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:17,819
who will lift you up and believe in your

1086
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:21,120
brand and work with companies that you

1087
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,980
believe in we have so many choices when

1088
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,660
it comes to brands and companies and

1089
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,180
people that we can work with in this day

1090
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:30,120
and age so your interactions your

1091
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,740
opinions your relationships all of those

1092
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,480
matter when you're trying to build your

1093
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,370
career and you're trying to build your

1094
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,170
personal brand make sure that you're

1095
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,240
telling your story with your life

1096
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,760
and that you live with it every single

1097
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,500
day so you don't get on life and you say

1098
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,569
or you don't get on the line and say

1099
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,490
something that is completely opposite of

1100
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:49,190
what you want people to know you ads

1101
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:52,109
make sure that you're constantly

1102
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:54,510
authentic tell your story with your life

1103
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:56,970
and with your experiences because those

1104
00:44:54,510 --> 00:45:00,359
are always authentic and live by those

1105
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:03,180
experiences live with your own brand

1106
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:05,940
going off those rails can really confuse

1107
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,279
people if it's totally random

1108
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,290
I realize that my Sailor Moon obsession

1109
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,460
is somewhat new online but it's

1110
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,859
something that I've always been

1111
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,650
passionate about it's very silly but

1112
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:18,779
it's true so I share it with people

1113
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,579
because I'm it's a part of my brand now

1114
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,309
and I'm trying to get people to

1115
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:24,839
understand that loving Sailor Moon and

1116
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:27,390
being obsessed with that anime of all

1117
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:30,540
things it is a part of what I think is

1118
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:33,390
important be living proof of what you

1119
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,730
want to be and live by that brand tell

1120
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,650
your story make an attention-getting

1121
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:40,410
make it something that is relevant and

1122
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:43,559
beneficial and memorable to everybody

1123
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:46,770
around you see the future our branding

1124
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:48,390
is not just companies branding

1125
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,430
themselves but it's also personal

1126
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,009
branding and it is already here

1127
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:55,259
especially in this day and age of social

1128
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:57,540
media with companies looking at your

1129
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,730
social media and considering maybe you

1130
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,349
for a job or maybe somebody else it

1131
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:03,510
could be your personal brand that makes

1132
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:04,680
them breaks it so if you have something

1133
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,869
out there that makes you look

1134
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,089
professional makes people understand

1135
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:10,710
what you're passionate about makes sense

1136
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:12,750
and it's something that they can relate

1137
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,640
to and if they see you as being

1138
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,510
authentic then they would be more likely

1139
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,828
to consider you for that next talk

1140
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:22,140
consider you for that next session

1141
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:24,299
consider you for that next job that

1142
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,460
they're hiring for all of it can

1143
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:29,490
absolutely help you get that new job and

1144
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,380
maintain the skills that you need to

1145
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,299
continue down your route for your career

1146
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,799
this is why I think that personal

1147
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:37,259
branding is so important not just for

1148
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:39,329
youtubers like me but also for everybody

1149
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,329
