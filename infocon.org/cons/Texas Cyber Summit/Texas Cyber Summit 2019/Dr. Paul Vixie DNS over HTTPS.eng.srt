1
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:38,570
good evening and thank you for coming to

2
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:42,199
the Texas summit this is dr. Paul vixie

3
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:51,070
and he is with Farsight security with a

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:55,010
presentation thank you good afternoon

5
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:59,239
thank you for coming I was hoping to get

6
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:03,409
a few more of you but it'll be probably

7
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,298
more more private this way I guess I'm

8
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:08,720
gonna do what I usually do which is to

9
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:12,049
cram 200 minutes of presentation into

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,179
about 55 minutes slot I'll leave some

11
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:16,250
time for questions also be at the

12
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,270
reception tonight so if you want to talk

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,490
in more detail we can talk then so I'll

14
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:27,110
have to begin with some history to

15
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:29,210
explain current events it's really

16
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,869
dangerous to interpret what's happening

17
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,759
today without knowing some of the run-up

18
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:38,840
to it and in this case the run-up to

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:43,730
current events about passive DNS and DNS

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,220
over TLS DNS over HTTP has been building

21
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,960
since really the commercialization and

22
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,070
privatization of the internet started in

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,100
the mid-90s

24
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,809
so I promise not to give you a complete

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,729
blow-by-blow but it is going to be

26
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,830
necessary to go through some of the

27
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:03,650
events that brought us here I brought

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:07,039
you to wonder what is DNS doing going

29
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:11,300
over HTTP in the first place so our

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:15,080
story begins in the 17th century where a

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,319
number of diplomats from various

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,069
kingdoms in Europe met in what is now

33
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,220
the German town of Westphalia and tried

34
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,730
to end a couple of decades long Wars and

35
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:33,019
as happens from time to time in human

36
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:36,649
history they couldn't figure out exactly

37
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,900
who to negotiate with famously when it

38
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,900
was time for the conflict in Vietnam to

39
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,930
end in the late 60s they spent about two

40
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,739
years arguing

41
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,959
about the shape of the conference table

42
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,969
which turned out to be a proxy for what

43
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,030
the ultimate settlement was going to be

44
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:56,219
in other words where people were sitting

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,989
and what shape the conference table had

46
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:01,049
around each party who was sitting there

47
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,519
was actually the proxy for what the

48
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:06,299
final boundaries were going to be

49
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,790
between the conflicting nations so the

50
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:12,510
earlier equivalent of that in the 17th

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,418
century was who do we invite to come up

52
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,000
with these this treaty and they had to

53
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,739
then make some qualifying assumptions

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,129
they had to put some constraints on it

55
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,069
which is that you had to be a nation

56
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,439
which was not a term that was widely

57
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:31,649
understood at that time in other words

58
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,689
they had to define sovereignty first and

59
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,859
then they could figure out who was

60
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:41,129
allowed to make peace and ultimately

61
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,409
they came up with the requirements that

62
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,780
I have copied here from the Wikipedia

63
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:48,989
page and what it amounts to is that you

64
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,169
are a sovereign state if you can control

65
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,449
your border the the way that they would

66
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:57,150
then you know measure that is can you

67
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:00,060
keep people inside that border from

68
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,739
attacking people outside that border and

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,989
are you willing to take responsibility

70
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,159
for any such attacks so in other words

71
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,829
if you could prove that you could

72
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,370
control borders then you were deemed

73
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:14,310
worthy of negotiating those borders so

74
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:18,298
it really was in a way cementing the

75
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:22,169
borders as the wars had had pushed them

76
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,419
and it was also respecting the power of

77
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,909
the strong so there wasn't a lot of

78
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,520
thought about justice or democracy here

79
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:34,020
they was these were by and large royal

80
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,900
kingdoms but this is how we got the

81
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,090
modern definition of statehood this is

82
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,630
what we're still using obviously the

83
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:46,229
United States was not there we did not

84
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:48,300
exist at that time and and yet this is

85
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:49,500
the definition we use in all of our

86
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,389
diplomacy

87
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,419
no one from Asia was there but this is

88
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,790
how they recognized each other when an

89
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,250
Asian nation is

90
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:01,010
trying to decide who to negotiate a

91
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,430
trade treaty with this is the definition

92
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:08,300
of the capability of negotiation now

93
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:12,020
what you're not seeing here is the

94
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,340
corporations in other words these really

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,799
were talking about the ability to

96
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:20,150
control borders they're not controlling

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:23,480
the flows of trade goods and what we've

98
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,060
seen since then is in the rearview

99
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,570
mirror allowed by our perspective in

100
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:33,280
history is that they only understood two

101
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:36,200
of the domains of operations of warfare

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,109
the first two having been land and sea

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,539
they were fighting wars using land and

104
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,160
using sea and they could sort of figure

105
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,590
out exactly what treaties off to say

106
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,340
about those things but they didn't know

107
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:51,500
yet about air so not only did they did

108
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,390
not foresee a time when biplanes with

109
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,460
machine guns would end up sort of

110
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,590
softening borders and making it a little

111
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:03,580
bit harder to have a hard border they

112
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:06,859
did not foresee bird flu so a lot of the

113
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,609
ideology that we follow in order to

114
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,520
understand what a nation-state is is

115
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,070
been obliterated by subsequent events

116
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,289
and they certainly did not foresee space

117
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:25,909
where you can either drop munitions from

118
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,640
orbit or you can surveil from orbit read

119
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,010
license plates at other peoples in other

120
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,669
people's capital cities none of that was

121
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,710
foreseeable in 1648 and again we're

122
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,500
seeing the results of that now which is

123
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,900
that we don't know how to treat nations

124
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,330
that have those powers but the most

125
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,310
egregious lack of foresight that they

126
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,890
had was that they did not foresee

127
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,480
information technology they did not

128
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,640
understand that there would someday be a

129
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,300
conference like this one full of people

130
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,130
like you in a business like we're in

131
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,310
which is a completely borderless affair

132
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,860
where they thought a nation would be

133
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,490
able to protect its citizens from

134
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,130
attacks by foreign actors and when

135
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,080
there was a hard border and it was to be

136
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,919
understood only in terms of land and sea

137
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:18,039
that was so it is not true today anybody

138
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,680
in the world can attack anybody else in

139
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,789
the world either to get copies of their

140
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,090
information to face that information

141
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:32,560
transform the flows of wealth

142
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:36,969
so really nation-states are they're

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,250
often considered to be an anachronism in

144
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,530
other words that's just a boundary on a

145
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,360
map and it's a flag and it's a Wikipedia

146
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,758
page but that's all it is and what we

147
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,370
will actually do has citizens of our

148
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,590
respective nations is largely

149
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,389
irrespective of that citizenship I don't

150
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,789
agree with this I don't think that we've

151
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,370
demonstrated any of the wisdom that we

152
00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:01,360
ought to have before we try to plan a

153
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:03,340
post national future and yet it's

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,530
happening there are a lot of people very

155
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,060
interested in that outcome I'm going to

156
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:13,080
come back to that but first let's talk

157
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:17,409
about DNS so this is the traditional

158
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:20,409
three layer chart it's in almost all of

159
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:23,110
my presentations for most of the last 20

160
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:27,219
years because it hasn't changed much

161
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,289
since then this laptop that I'm using to

162
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:31,659
display this this presentation is an

163
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:34,750
example of a stub resolver yet learned

164
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,429
the address of its recursive server went

165
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,919
at the same time that it learned its own

166
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,620
address when I joined the Wi-Fi here and

167
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,049
so it knows to that if it wants to get a

168
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,750
answer from DNS it should send that

169
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,779
query to some server that was told to it

170
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,850
when it's and on the Wi-Fi I could

171
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,810
override that a lot of people do because

172
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,480
you might not trust your hotel or

173
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:01,569
whatever else to be able to answer your

174
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,529
questions correctly so you might be

175
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,390
using Google or Open DNS or maybe you're

176
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:09,910
even using a VPN or you're talking to

177
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,300
your home servers I myself run a name

178
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,110
server in my laptop

179
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,910
not many people do that so you can

180
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,769
ignore that information but it is made

181
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,709
available to you as part of getting an

182
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,720
IP address whenever you sign on if you

183
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,790
asked that server a question that it

184
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,029
doesn't know the answer to then it will

185
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,699
go find it and it finds it from that top

186
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,950
layer which is the authority server and

187
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,920
the authority servers is where answers

188
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,709
enter the DNS system from outside right

189
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,140
the DNS is not omniscient it cannot

190
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,099
predict the answers to any questions it

191
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,410
must be told

192
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,380
now some authority servers as example

193
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,029
maybe a CDN like Akamai doesn't have a

194
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,589
database there they've actually got a

195
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,269
program telling you what the answer is

196
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,779
going to be but nevertheless it fulfills

197
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,430
the role of having DNS information enter

198
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,890
the system from outside and that's it

199
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,199
those are the three kinds of DNS

200
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,890
protocol speakers we're at the bottom

201
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,810
asking questions at the top are the

202
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,689
answers and in the middle the answers

203
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,170
meet the questions that's it so now you

204
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,660
understand how the DNS works and I don't

205
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,939
expect that to change much in your

206
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,130
lifetime although it's being changed in

207
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,140
minor ways by every innovator who enters

208
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:29,570
the field it's always going to look

209
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:31,850
something like this so that led to a

210
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:36,230
certain topology of where those servers

211
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,550
would be located so back in the 90s when

212
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,620
we were first commercializing and

213
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,520
privatizing all this the users and

214
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,870
applications on some land probably hard

215
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,970
coax Ethernet at the time rather than

216
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,089
Wi-Fi but pretty much speaking the same

217
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,279
protocol that Wi-Fi speaks would then be

218
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,839
part of some kind of campus or maybe one

219
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,589
building or your house and you had a

220
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,029
connection to an ISP and then that ISP

221
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,000
had the job of connecting you to the

222
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:04,339
internet and so in the earliest days

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,790
that recursive name server going back to

224
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:10,579
the previous slide was on your land with

225
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,819
you because that there was no business

226
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:15,709
that provided it for you and it was

227
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,480
expected that it would be very close by

228
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,399
less than a millisecond of round-trip

229
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,209
time

230
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,709
but as we will see it started moving

231
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:30,719
further away from you for various

232
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:34,498
reasons so episode 1 of the DNS wars was

233
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,920
something called site finder Verisign

234
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:38,939
was the company operating the dot-com

235
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,709
authority servers so they were

236
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:43,920
responsible for telling you where to

237
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:45,929
find example dot-coms name servers or

238
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,729
you know whatever you needed to know

239
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:49,290
about com if you didn't have enough

240
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,079
information you would go to those

241
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,059
servers to get it and they realized that

242
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,638
at that time that was almost everything

243
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:59,279
there there wasn't a lot of content in

244
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,639
the DNS in the early 2000s was not

245
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,309
inside dot-com and so they were seeing

246
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,449
all kinds of questions at their name

247
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:11,490
servers for domains that didn't exist so

248
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:14,429
instead of example.com it would be you

249
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,839
know exempt 7 comm or it would be some

250
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,699
type of graphical error it would be some

251
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,470
kind of problem where they they were

252
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:20,729
getting a lot of questions for names

253
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,749
that they couldn't give a positive

254
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:26,730
answer or a delegation response to and

255
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:27,240
they thought well that seems like a big

256
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,189
waste

257
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,799
why don't we answer positively for all

258
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:38,279
of those non-existent domains that we

259
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:42,929
keep seeing and the answer should be the

260
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:45,869
address of an advertiser after all that

261
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:48,119
web had been coming to existence by this

262
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:49,980
time and so they could just assume that

263
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:51,779
the questions that they were answering

264
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,009
negatively were coming from web browsers

265
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,790
and they could just give you the IP

266
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:58,649
address of the site finder advertising

267
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,079
service and they would tell that server

268
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:03,600
what name you had originally requested

269
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,910
so that they could pick the ad that most

270
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,160
closely approximated the mistake you

271
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:14,429
made this was controversial

272
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,469
I myself was the maintainer of bind and

273
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:19,589
also the CEO of the company who

274
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:22,589
maintained bind and we had on the street

275
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:25,799
within 40 hours they patched bind that

276
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:29,730
would render this change by Verisign to

277
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,189
be completely ineffective and for my

278
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,210
trouble

279
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,770
I was named as a co-conspirator and that

280
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,610
was turned out to be a fine thing

281
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:41,530
because we all got this great t-shirt

282
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,990
but it really was the first time anybody

283
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,959
realized that there was a war for

284
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,120
control of the DNS resolution path and

285
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,120
the DNS was the key to everything

286
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,610
whether something good or something

287
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,080
malicious nothing was going to happen on

288
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,080
the internet without a DNS request

289
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,820
happening first and being in the path of

290
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,100
those questions so that you could see

291
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,370
what they were even if you didn't

292
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:10,300
perturb them was incredibly valuable

293
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:13,660
commercially so eventually Verisign took

294
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:17,199
that out settled their various lawsuits

295
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,030
I should probably frame the at least the

296
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,250
opening page of that lawsuits and

297
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:26,890
because at this point it's collector's

298
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:30,850
item episode two would have been open

299
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:33,069
DNS as a company started by friends of

300
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,040
mine everybody in the DNS industry knew

301
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,990
each other even then and they thought

302
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,630
there's no reason people should have to

303
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,280
get their name service from a server

304
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,720
that they operate on their own land

305
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,990
that's crazy they don't know how to do

306
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,060
it and we shouldn't trust the ISPs to do

307
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,740
it for them which is peace we're doing

308
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,680
at the time because those ISPs you're

309
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,330
just gonna collect the information and

310
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,689
use it for their own nefarious purposes

311
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,630
so we at Open DNS are going to create a

312
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,030
name service that is out there on the

313
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:08,590
other side of the internet from where

314
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:11,140
you started so they did exactly what

315
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,730
site finder had done they did not give

316
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,560
negative answers if you asked a question

317
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,160
where the answer was going to be

318
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,079
negative they would give you the address

319
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,699
of an advertising and web service and

320
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,620
again they would tell it what name you

321
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,270
had looked up so it could choose an ad

322
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,589
that was very close to the mistake you

323
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,780
made and nobody complained about this

324
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:33,460
because it's not the same as Verisign

325
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,560
doing it because you could avoid it you

326
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,980
didn't have to use the Open DNS server

327
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,000
so it wasn't really a big problem for

328
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,950
the world it was a

329
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,340
for OpenDNS though because it didn't

330
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,920
make them any money and that was really

331
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,110
the earliest age of what we now call the

332
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,760
fail-fast era which is where you declare

333
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,800
a product and you roll it out with

334
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,590
mighty fanfare and then six months later

335
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,000
it disappears without a trace and they

336
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,370
don't even announce that it doesn't that

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,060
it doesn't exist anymore

338
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:06,370
Google does that frequently but Open DNS

339
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,750
I think was the first one to do that so

340
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,580
they thought there's got to be some

341
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:12,250
other way that we can monetize this

342
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,980
thing that we're giving away and so they

343
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,200
thought you know Google this which was a

344
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,150
new company at that time has got a very

345
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,900
popular search service it's much more

346
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:25,110
popular than Alta Vista and you know if

347
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,520
somebody asks us what is the address of

348
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,320
google.com we don't have to tell the

349
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,370
truth we can give them the address of

350
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,980
our search page instead now I want to

351
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,200
say this was not an overtly malicious

352
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:41,860
act they didn't pretend to be Google you

353
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,360
could see the Open DNS logo Aniston as

354
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,220
you entered your search string and hit

355
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,230
the I'm feeling lucky button or whatever

356
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,270
button you might hit it was just gonna

357
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,490
send you off to the Google search page

358
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,680
they didn't have an index there wasn't

359
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,060
they couldn't answer the question what

360
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,739
they wanted to know is what you had

361
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,109
looked up because they were gonna

362
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,140
associate those keywords with your IP

363
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,599
address because your IP address uniquely

364
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,010
identifies your laptop or you know I

365
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,020
don't think we had smartphones in that

366
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:11,140
in those days but they could tell who

367
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,030
you were if you visited that search page

368
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,280
and then you visited anywhere else and

369
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:18,730
so again they use this for advertising

370
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,589
optimization so Google as you might

371
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,560
expect wasn't real pleased about this

372
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,649
and they they called him up and said

373
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,329
we'd like you to stop that and the

374
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,490
OpenDNS people said look you're not

375
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,889
suffering any losses you can't sue us

376
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,140
for this there's no law requiring us to

377
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,850
give the right answer to these questions

378
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,330
so we're pretty comfortable continuing

379
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,040
to doing what we're doing and I'm not

380
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,780
saying that there's a direct cause and

381
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,930
effect here but I will say that within

382
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:50,440
45 days of that phone call 8.8.8.8

383
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,910
appeared which is probably what I would

384
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,450
have done if I'd been at Google at that

385
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,489
time

386
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,470
which is okay if you're gonna answer

387
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:58,179
wrong then we're gonna start an even

388
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,429
bigger service that's easy it has an

389
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,529
easier IP address for people to remember

390
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,080
and we're gonna swamp you we're going to

391
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:07,210
create a massively larger system and it

392
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,428
will always answer correctly and to

393
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,529
Google's credit they have never done

394
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:13,480
anything except to answer the questions

395
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,159
honestly that they receive Google does a

396
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,999
lot of things I don't like but at least

397
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:22,149
in this particular case they are a good

398
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:25,090
example now there's a lot more coming

399
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:27,008
right you know about 9.9 and one dog one

400
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,720
but I will tell you that if you do

401
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,659
careful research through Whois you'll

402
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,249
find that there's about 200 more

403
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:36,070
addresses out there that are numbered

404
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:38,200
number dot number dot number and you

405
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,689
will within your lifetime hear from all

406
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,759
of them each one of them will claim to

407
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,100
be better than the others and will say

408
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,440
that they are either faster or safer or

409
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,748
more accurate or more privacy protecting

410
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,139
or something and the reason why these

411
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:55,840
things are coming out is not because the

412
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:58,059
operators of those 200 name servers have

413
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,529
your best interests in in in their

414
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:04,299
hearts they want your data I just

415
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:07,480
recently finished a big fight with my

416
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:10,989
online expense provider because they

417
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,179
started to optically scan and do the the

418
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:14,649
optical character recognition on all of

419
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:17,679
the receipts that we were sending

420
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:19,268
through their online system and I said I

421
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,129
didn't ask for that I don't want that

422
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,419
and they said well we're doing that and

423
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:24,279
so if you don't like it you're gonna

424
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:26,799
have to find another provider which were

425
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,049
the process of doing and the reason for

426
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,970
that is that they cannot make money from

427
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:33,100
what they can charge us they have to

428
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,509
know exactly where my employees were in

429
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,299
the world and what they had for dinner

430
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:39,279
and where they had it exactly what time

431
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:41,769
they had it in order to progress their

432
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:46,029
real revenue source which is to monetize

433
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:48,369
personal data that is that should always

434
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:50,289
be your first suspicion when somebody is

435
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:57,070
offering you something for free over the

436
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:59,619
Internet episode 3 the content delivery

437
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,950
networks got pretty upset about the

438
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:03,970
anycast networks because what they were

439
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,609
doing

440
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,559
let's say that you're a c'mon you're the

441
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:11,228
authority server for Microsoft comm

442
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,499
you've got a mirror of all of Microsoft

443
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:17,559
comms web content in every major

444
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:19,419
metropolitan area in the world and you

445
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,690
need to know at the time you receive a

446
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:25,029
DNS question which of the or various

447
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,239
mirrors around the world that particular

448
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,100
client address is closest to because

449
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:33,070
that's the value proposition of Akamai's

450
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:36,039
to get to optimize your content delivery

451
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:38,289
by making people reach a server a mirror

452
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,970
server close to them but they weren't

453
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:42,158
seeing those addresses anymore it was

454
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,259
all coming from 8.8 it was all coming

455
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,720
from Open DNS and they had no way

456
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:49,269
anymore to use the IP address of your

457
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,109
DNS query to predict the IP address of

458
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:56,830
whatever web query would follow it and

459
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:59,889
so they started a big campaign called a

460
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:02,259
DNS client subnet and to give you an

461
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:04,389
idea about how this was marketed the web

462
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:07,599
server is still online it's called a

463
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:09,609
faster internet com they didn't they

464
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,439
didn't say more people need your

465
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:12,970
personal information so please run this

466
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,369
protocol but in fact that's what

467
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:18,879
happened I can tell you as the operator

468
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:23,649
of both a root name server and a couple

469
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:26,320
of fairly big content style authority

470
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:29,949
servers that the data we're getting from

471
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,939
a DNS the DNS client subnet tends to be

472
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:36,940
the full end-user IP address the RFC for

473
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,950
a DNS client subnet says yeah just you

474
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,700
mr. recursive name server please include

475
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:45,039
the Class C IP address of where the

476
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,960
actual DNS request came from we're not

477
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,970
seeing that we're seeing its last 32

478
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,999
most of the time so this is so amazingly

479
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:57,309
bad for privacy that not even CloudFlare

480
00:21:54,999 --> 00:22:00,340
will support it if you use 1.1 you will

481
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:03,070
not get any content optimization because

482
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,499
they will not include your IP address in

483
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:10,599
the cache misses that they send to the

484
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:13,490
other authority servers so what you're

485
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:16,939
hopefully seeing with me is

486
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:19,760
everybody comes in sees a vacuum tries

487
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,460
to fill it adds some complexity hoping

488
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,490
to strike it rich and get out before

489
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:28,159
whatever deleterious side effects make

490
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:32,360
themselves known so in the 10 years 20

491
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:34,700
years from 1999 to 2019 we are now

492
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,760
sending our DNS requests all the way

493
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:40,429
from the bottom left at the top right

494
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,419
and then the top right that our DNS

495
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:46,220
bubble is sending your IP address down

496
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:48,380
to the content delivery network server

497
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,630
that actually operates as the authority

498
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,799
so that everybody can know exactly who

499
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:56,840
you are it's really between you and your

500
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,190
god as to whether you think all they're

501
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,600
doing with your information is

502
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:05,149
optimizing your web delivery any case

503
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,500
this also shows that we're going to keep

504
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:11,418
doing this there's going to be another

505
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:15,970
episode every couple of years and we're

506
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:19,279
in the middle of one now so everybody

507
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,620
along the very long path between you and

508
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,690
your name server can witness what you're

509
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,559
doing and possibly perturb what answer

510
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,600
you get we saw a lot of abuse and

511
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:32,559
nothing that can be abused won't be I

512
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,379
don't know why we keep forgetting that

513
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,450
so the IETF said all right let's secure

514
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,700
this DNS thing let's encrypt everything

515
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,090
so that that long path with all of those

516
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,940
middleware boxes and you know the

517
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,678
middlemen and advertisers and state

518
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,690
surveillance nation-states surveillance

519
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,270
can no longer see what you're doing

520
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,909
and they did and it was called DNS over

521
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,730
TLS so uses the same encryption that

522
00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:02,659
HTTPS would use but it's on its own port

523
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,700
number it's TCP port 8 v 3 it's a much

524
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:07,399
better protocol than the old DNS TCP

525
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,399
protocol in fact it is good enough but I

526
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:13,570
think it could replace UDP this was a

527
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:15,918
very well engineered protocol however

528
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,700
there was a problem it did not solve

529
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,260
which is since it runs on a fixed port

530
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,350
number

531
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,350
it is possible for a network operator to

532
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,120
block it they can't see what your

533
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,679
question is but they can certainly see

534
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,899
that you're asking one because after all

535
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,870
you've got a TCP connection open to port

536
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,580
eight five three on some remote server

537
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,860
so they can at least see the timing of

538
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,720
your request and they can't see the

539
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,520
answer either it's very well encrypted

540
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,290
nobody's breaking that crypto until we

541
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:49,620
get to quantum computers but

542
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:52,899
nevertheless the ability of those

543
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,600
parties to see that there was a DNS

544
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,660
transaction was seen as a problem and

545
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,600
the ability of those middle parties to

546
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,250
block such transactions was also seen as

547
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,649
a problem and so a different part of the

548
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,190
IETF this is the part dedicated to web

549
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:11,230
technologies decided okay so we see a

550
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,580
d-o-t and we're gonna raise you a do H

551
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:19,180
we're gonna speak DNS directly over HTTP

552
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:21,580
instead of over TLS protocol and that

553
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,580
means it's going to be on TCP port 443

554
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,350
along with all of the other traffic so

555
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,419
you won't be able to necessarily tell

556
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,860
which ones were DNS questions and which

557
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,820
ones weren't and you will certainly not

558
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:36,729
be in a position to block them and

559
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,300
that's intentional they there are

560
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:42,160
apparently a lot of people who are

561
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,830
witnessing surveilling or blocking DNS

562
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,610
transactions that are evil by the

563
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:50,980
standards of a lot of other people

564
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:54,370
unfortunately you know I've been using

565
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,010
DNS filtering and DNS monitoring to

566
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,750
secure networks forever and I'm going to

567
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,879
give you some URLs of some open

568
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,660
technologies that I have helped develop

569
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,660
that you can use to do the same but the

570
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:10,270
idea that the seaso with some company or

571
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:14,050
the parent of some household has a

572
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:16,240
reason to block or monitor DNS because

573
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,159
that's the company policy or that's how

574
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,010
that set of parents wants to exercise

575
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,670
their parental duties was not seen as a

576
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:26,980
sufficient exception so this unblockable

577
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,440
technology is now available from inside

578
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,320
of networks that used to be putative lis

579
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,660
somewhat secure

580
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,460
I'll see here's the new picture I put a

581
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,170
box around the two things on the right

582
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:43,090
unist happened DNS rpz are the standard

583
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:45,430
open-source methods by which you is the

584
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,669
operator of a recursive server would be

585
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,130
able to see what's happening and perturb

586
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,830
it deliberately for example if you know

587
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,600
that there is a certain botnet out there

588
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,780
and that it needs a certain command and

589
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,389
control name that is generated by an

590
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,309
algorithm so it's a DG a botnet you

591
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,050
might want to block all of the command

592
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:08,440
and control names that will be used

593
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:10,300
tomorrow and then the day after that

594
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,920
you'll again block all the ones at leas

595
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,840
tomorrow and so forth thus keeping any

596
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,070
of those bots on your networks from

597
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,159
reaching their command and control

598
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,980
server that used to be considered your

599
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,350
right now it's not so I've removed the

600
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,390
firewall it's irrelevant because the

601
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,490
stub resolver czar now speaking doah

602
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,360
directly to a recursive server that is

603
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:33,220
outside your firewall and those things

604
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,050
that have not had their code upgraded

605
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,750
yet are still using whatever recursive

606
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,639
server you told them to use I want to

607
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:44,020
tell you the way I found out this was

608
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:46,450
coming was my chromecast was asking all

609
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,730
of its DNS questions straight to 8.8.8.8

610
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:53,050
which is not the name server I assign it

611
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:56,230
in DHCP so I've locked that complaint to

612
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:59,470
Google and offered that chromecast my

613
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:01,600
own copy of 8.8 inside my firewall and

614
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,730
everything is fine but eventually the

615
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,260
chromecast is going to switch to do H

616
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,330
it's going to know that it's me and it's

617
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,460
not going to work anymore and at that

618
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,220
time probably my last use of YouTube

619
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:15,100
will be to post the video of me crushing

620
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,170
that chromecast in the vise because in

621
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:22,178
my house you follow my rules and if you

622
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:26,290
don't like that don't come here so there

623
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:28,380
are a lot of problems with do H mostly

624
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:32,230
I'm upset because it's a political

625
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:36,100
solution it's a technical solution to a

626
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:38,470
political problem and it's a big lie

627
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,780
this will not keep you out of jail if

628
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,950
you're in authoritarian countries

629
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,690
somewhere and you criticize the

630
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,180
government

631
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,070
you really need to encrypt not just your

632
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,780
DNS questions and answers but all the

633
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,419
packets that come after it because

634
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,490
otherwise any on path attacker can look

635
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,650
at the packets that come after it figure

636
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,720
out what answer you must have received

637
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,760
in ordered that you made the connection

638
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,470
you did and from that it's a trivial

639
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,930
matter of data science to figure out

640
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,730
what question you probably asked so the

641
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,250
people who actually believe this are

642
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,990
going to jail and I hate that I hate

643
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,490
that they're being made less safe so

644
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,290
that a bunch of people can feel smug

645
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:18,270
about their technical solution to a

646
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:20,670
political problem it will also opt you

647
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:22,530
out of any local naming you might have

648
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,620
if you've got some dot local or dot home

649
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,990
or dot Corp or whatever names probably

650
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,820
the distant recursive name server that's

651
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:34,050
being used instead of yours won't have

652
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,179
those answers hopefully they won't and

653
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,040
you know the problems just go on and on

654
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,140
and I don't have enough time here today

655
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,600
to give you the details of this because

656
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,670
I want to get back to Westphalia but

657
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,209
I'll make these slides available and you

658
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:51,390
can certainly track down my twitter

659
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,460
handle ins my name and look at the very

660
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:57,750
long arguments that have been had about

661
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:00,270
this in the last year or so but in

662
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,950
summary I would put up with the costs if

663
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,050
there was a benefit but there isn't one

664
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:08,630
the only benefit is a bunch of people

665
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:10,800
feeling smug and having more power now

666
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,440
people in the world who think that the

667
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,540
Chinese Communist Party has a budget has

668
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,050
some limit to how much money they are

669
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:22,790
willing to spend to secure the thinking

670
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:25,860
of their population against outrageous

671
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:28,590
fake news about Tiananmen Square and

672
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,959
Taiwan and the rest I don't think they

673
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,580
have any limit to how far they will go I

674
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,680
don't think that if we make this too

675
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,449
complicated that they will suddenly say

676
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,010
you know this whole Great Firewall of

677
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,750
China was a mistake let's just let

678
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,780
everybody see everything that's not the

679
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:46,590
outcome to expect we can think of all

680
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:49,830
kinds of deleterious outcomes that are

681
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,019
more likely than that so we're going to

682
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,349
say

683
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:58,679
when I started the first anti-spam

684
00:30:55,349 --> 00:31:00,989
company back in the 90s a lot of people

685
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,519
complained because I invented this thing

686
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:06,389
called the real-time black hole list

687
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,589
which every one of you is using no

688
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:09,329
matter how you're getting your email

689
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:13,079
today the rbl is keeping you from

690
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:14,789
getting more of it and a lot of people

691
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,649
said Paul the Internet should be open

692
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:19,109
and I said yeah but there are people out

693
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:21,478
there sending things that nobody wants

694
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:23,668
to get we need a catalogue of those

695
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:27,479
peoples so that if somebody wants to

696
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:28,649
opt-out they can and in particular what

697
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:30,690
I said is my server

698
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:32,819
it's my mail server I will set the rules

699
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:37,259
on what it accepts and what it doesn't I

700
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:39,769
got to say that this protocol do age has

701
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:45,179
an internet standard method of bypassing

702
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:47,789
enterprise and family controls takes

703
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,979
that away from me I'm going to be at the

704
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:52,529
point sooner or later I'm gonna be at

705
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:54,539
the point of apologizing to somebody for

706
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:58,589
something my network did that I had no

707
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:00,690
power to stop because of do H so this is

708
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:03,809
actually a very dramatic change of who

709
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,779
owns what and how that ownership can and

710
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:09,359
cannot be demonstrated now I don't want

711
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,249
you to get complacent and think that

712
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,829
this is as bad as it gets because this

713
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:15,509
is only the first of many steps the idea

714
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:17,879
that you would have to ask a DNS

715
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:20,279
question and wait for the answer before

716
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:23,759
somebody could show you an ad is crazy

717
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:26,009
talk they have a way in the advertising

718
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,109
industry has a way of measuring the

719
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:30,929
number of Pico seconds between the up

720
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:32,939
click of your mouse and the time that

721
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:35,509
the first photon from the resulting

722
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,099
advertisement strikes your eyeball and

723
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:39,929
the time it takes to make a DNS request

724
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,509
and the possibility that you might block

725
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:45,179
that DNS request is a risk they can't

726
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:46,919
tolerate so what they're doing next is

727
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,739
they're putting the DNS information that

728
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,199
you will need to fetch all the various

729
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:55,919
ads and other graphics and JavaScript

730
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:57,629
blobs and style sheets into the webpage

731
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,089
that contains the pointers to those

732
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:02,728
objects it's called a resolver this DNS

733
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:04,300
there are no questions only answers the

734
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:05,830
answers are not secured

735
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,780
browser has no way of knowing whether

736
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,580
that is the right answer the right IP

737
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:14,170
address for that domain name it just has

738
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:15,189
to believe what it's told I don't think

739
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,380
there's much you're gonna be able to do

740
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,390
to stop this I'm hoping that there's at

741
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,340
least an option in the browsers to turn

742
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,740
it off what these browsers are funded by

743
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,959
the industry that cares deeply about the

744
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,590
the time between the click and the

745
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:33,340
eyeball so getting back toward

746
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:36,520
Westphalia I wanna say that the British

747
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:41,320
East India Company and the Dutch East

748
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:43,000
India Company were treaty participants

749
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,419
they actually signed treaties with

750
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,770
nations and that made a certain amount

751
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,360
of sense because they were crown

752
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,400
corporations they were actually

753
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,350
incorporated by the crown even though

754
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,390
they had a lot of private ownership so

755
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,310
it was in a sense a proxy for the

756
00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:00,250
British government or for the Dutch

757
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:02,980
government but from that time until this

758
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,950
we have not seen treaties entered into

759
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,960
between corporations and countries and I

760
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:11,590
have to tell you that Mozilla

761
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:15,460
Corporation who makes Firefox plans to

762
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,980
change the default on all browsers from

763
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,650
use the one that you got from the

764
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:25,780
operating system to use boah to

765
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:29,980
CloudFlare they announced that they've

766
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:33,520
made no apologies for it they don't care

767
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,650
what we think of it and the people in

768
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,150
the United Kingdom at least the

769
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:40,179
government of the United Kingdom said

770
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:42,480
wait we don't love that that's a problem

771
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:45,610
for us because we've got national laws

772
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,490
forbidding the propagation of let's say

773
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,679
online child abuse materials so we

774
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:53,889
really don't want it to be that by

775
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,929
default our UK citizens are going to be

776
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:58,870
switched to a browser or scuse me to a

777
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,240
resolver in California that does not

778
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:04,630
observe British law this is bad for us

779
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,189
please don't do it and mozilla sent a

780
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,780
bunch of executives over there and they

781
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,850
had a meeting and there were press

782
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,160
releases and headlines and so forth

783
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,310
because most of all agreed to not do the

784
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,990
thing the

785
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:19,730
the British government asked them not to

786
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:22,490
do and I have to say that this is not in

787
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:25,400
the Westphalian tradition and is not

788
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:27,350
supposed to be necessary for a sovereign

789
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,120
government to negotiate with a

790
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:36,170
corporation about how they will behave

791
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:38,569
in that in that territory so I'm not

792
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,370
sure we are wise enough to enter the era

793
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,850
that we are being dragged kicking and

794
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:48,830
screaming into but it does make me

795
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:52,000
wonder how many other applications like

796
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:54,440
Firefox are going to implement this and

797
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,920
how many of them are gonna be willing to

798
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:01,010
go to the UK and given that there are

799
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,590
246 country codes in the DNS handing in

800
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:06,170
things like UK and us and so forth how

801
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:08,710
many of those 246 so-called sovereign

802
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:10,790
territories are those application

803
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,900
providers going to be willing to visit

804
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,420
in order to figure out what those

805
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:19,370
countries do and do not want I don't

806
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:22,210
think that scales so in the old days

807
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:26,750
before the publication of RFC 848 for

808
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:29,120
standardized ëoh we treated cooperation

809
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,740
as necessary right if you don't speak

810
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,870
the right protocol the other end is not

811
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,930
going to understand you you don't

812
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:38,690
respect the address and domain name

813
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,220
allocations made by others and you

814
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,990
decided I'm gonna use those addresses

815
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,870
myself and there'd be a lot of people

816
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:47,600
you can't communicate with so it was

817
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:50,420
just expected that everybody along the

818
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:53,240
path between some users some

819
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,640
applications in some far end had the

820
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,009
ability to withdraw their cooperation as

821
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:02,330
I did with the RVL back in the early

822
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:04,070
years of the anti-spam effort now we

823
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:07,190
have an Internet standard that says you

824
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:09,890
know if one of these middle providers

825
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,540
pulls their little window up or down so

826
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,490
that you can no longer get a clear path

827
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,610
from one end to the other use this

828
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:19,229
protocol and that will abrogate their

829
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:24,930
sovereignty in your favor

830
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:28,800
I never expected the ietf to do this so

831
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:32,790
you have choices they're all bad but

832
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,640
that's the way package deals work you

833
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,900
can let every IOT vendor every browser

834
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:45,089
vendor every smart TV vendor do whatever

835
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:47,430
they darn well please and turn off your

836
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,990
parental controls and turn off any other

837
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,569
filtering you were doing because none of

838
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:54,330
that is it's not be to their benefit

839
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,960
that you have those powers or you can do

840
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,980
what I'm gonna do which is to fight

841
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,990
because possession used to be

842
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:09,200
nine-tenths of the law and I know how to

843
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:09,200
exercise it and many of you also know so

844
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:15,090
we are the beneficiaries in the internet

845
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,119
community of a whole lot of open-source

846
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:22,140
software and I realized that most of our

847
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:25,260
community runs on Linux which is open

848
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,200
source software very popular evidently

849
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,210
very effective I have been doing this

850
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,279
longer than Linux has existed and so I

851
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,980
haven't really made the jump so I'm

852
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,900
still using various flavors of BSD and

853
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,880
so my examples are going to be maybe

854
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,550
look to you a little bit like 1980s

855
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,590
technology but nevertheless I want to

856
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,380
show you what's possible it's not good

857
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:48,840
it's I'm not proud of this it has been

858
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,670
made necessary that I explore this

859
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,710
Avenue because I don't want to live in

860
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:58,200
the world the big tech wants to make for

861
00:38:52,710 --> 00:39:00,150
me so what you see here is a bunch of

862
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,520
snippets from various terminal windows

863
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,820
on the upper left you see me trying to

864
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,650
reach some server on port 444 I was

865
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,000
doing all my testing on four four four

866
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,710
instead of four four three because I

867
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,450
didn't want to break my own web service

868
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:17,220
while I was doing this work the box just

869
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:21,270
below that on the left you see the

870
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:24,149
output of a program that says hey I just

871
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,859
saw a syn packet headed to port 4 4 4

872
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,510
somewhere here's the source distant

873
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,750
source address and source port

874
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,990
destination address destination port

875
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:36,190
then made a passive DNS

876
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,140
look up passive DNS there are dozens of

877
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,550
providers I am one but it doesn't matter

878
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,368
which one you won't you want to use they

879
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,230
can all do this it gives you the ability

880
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:46,869
to ask the question so in the last ten

881
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,680
minutes what names have been seen in the

882
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:52,570
DNS as associated with this particular

883
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,330
destination address and so it gives you

884
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:57,640
a very short inventory of all the Dames

885
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,480
that are served by whatever webserver is

886
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,859
at that address

887
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:06,520
and so you can see IO is one of about

888
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:10,570
six reasons necessary to do this is that

889
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:13,030
under TLS 1.3 they are doing certificate

890
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:15,160
pinning and they are encrypting the sni

891
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,840
which means that no proxy that you used

892
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,129
to have at the border of your network is

893
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,010
going to know where the client

894
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:23,890
originally intended to go so you will no

895
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,240
longer be able to practice the kind of

896
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,430
man in the middle stuff that you've been

897
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,979
doing you're gonna have to do stuff like

898
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,859
this if you actually want to get in in

899
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,660
the middle of an HTTP transaction and

900
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,310
I'm not there right all I'm looking at

901
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,140
is the syn packet there's no payload

902
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,670
here I'm there's no encryption nothing

903
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:45,089
has started all I know is that there's

904
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:45,090
the desire to make a connection and so

905
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,359
in the bottom right there you see

906
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,420
there's a little loop there that does a

907
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,750
passive DNS question and then goes and

908
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:59,200
looks for you know each answer in its

909
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:01,119
turn and what's not shown in that

910
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,549
example is that I'm actually testing

911
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,780
that endpoint using that hostname as an

912
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:11,020
S and I to see if it would answer DNS

913
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:15,180
over HTTP so it's an enumeration attack

914
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:17,560
against the destination IP address and

915
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,470
what you see in the lower left is the

916
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,630
actual pseudocode for it if I can make

917
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,850
do H happen when I poison that IP

918
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:27,670
address I put it into a firewall table

919
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:30,368
that will cause all subsequent TCP sends

920
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,140
to be rejected and if it doesn't answer

921
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:33,820
do H then I put it into a different

922
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,580
firewall table so I don't have to test

923
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:38,350
it again and then things timeout

924
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,299
separately there's a cron job somewhere

925
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:44,350
that removes those things to cause a

926
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:46,600
retest sadly this works

927
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,730
now the place where doesn't work is

928
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,410
where passive DNS returns a hundred

929
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,750
thousand different things that all want

930
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,029
to point to that IP address so if

931
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,950
somebody puts a do H server into that

932
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:59,290
kind of a crowd you are not going to

933
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:03,850
succeed in an enumeration attack against

934
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:05,800
that IP and it'll be a local policy it's

935
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,810
up to you in other words whether you

936
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:14,140
decide to always allow or always deny

937
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:17,140
such things in my full vision we're

938
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:20,680
gonna end up with a explicit proxy so

939
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,480
that it can check for do H by looking at

940
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,940
the URI patterns because they all start

941
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,850
with the same slash DNS query or

942
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:30,420
whatever it is and browsers will simply

943
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:33,730
be told you have to talk to that proxy

944
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:36,610
and everybody else will just get bad

945
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,500
service but that's what I'm willing to

946
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:40,180
do in order to keep somebody else from

947
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,730
deciding what communications and

948
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:46,899
especially what naming is going to occur

949
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:49,720
inside by manage private networks so I

950
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,520
have a couple of examples of how this

951
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,549
has been playing out I really did say

952
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,170
what is written here in yellow with DLH

953
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,060
they're solving a problem most of the

954
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,220
world doesn't have by creating a problem

955
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:04,540
that everyone in the world will have I

956
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:07,750
did I said that I stand by a various

957
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,640
corporate persons we're challenged by

958
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,920
the reporter please answer dr. vixy's

959
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,350
complaint and you see in yellow that

960
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,860
each of them has a PR department and is

961
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:19,960
perfectly capable of misdirecting the

962
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,120
answer with something that can not be

963
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,340
proven false I'm not going to go through

964
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,460
the details this is what you get into if

965
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:29,620
you decide to fight the the big guys but

966
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:32,140
I gotta say the same day I was doing all

967
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,750
of this I got this email and I have to

968
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:39,069
tell you that when I do business with

969
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:41,140
eBay it is not from my net BST login so

970
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:43,930
I know that if I see that logo and that

971
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,089
email address on the same email message

972
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:50,799
then I know that it's a spoof of some

973
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:52,390
kind and I have DNS filtering on my

974
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,550
network so that all of the

975
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,650
infrastructure necessary to make that

976
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,500
appear have

977
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:00,510
men blacklisted no DNS requests of any

978
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,090
kind of the servers that serve this crap

979
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:05,940
will ever work at my house again and

980
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:08,730
that is the way that I try to maintain

981
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,410
some kind of an equilibrium between good

982
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,730
and evil in the networks I am

983
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:14,700
responsible for you're going to make

984
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:17,870
your own choices just like your choices

985
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:22,379
to be informed by sort of how

986
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:24,569
complicated you can make it so a managed

987
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,390
private network is seen as an

988
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:30,780
anachronism I guess like cars that are

989
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:33,210
not self driven nevertheless that's what

990
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,330
I have that's what a lot of you have if

991
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,770
you see so you probably have that kind

992
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:42,270
of man in the middle filtering on your

993
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:43,590
HTTP and a lot of people think that you

994
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,590
should not bother with that anymore

995
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,480
because that's just stupid you should

996
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,900
protect your endpoints but if you look

997
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,090
at the the manifest for this conference

998
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,040
or any similar security conference what

999
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:59,130
they're going to tell you talking after

1000
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,900
talk after talk everything's pwned right

1001
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,920
you can't secure your endpoints and if

1002
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,070
you think you can

1003
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,590
you're smoking the wrong thing you we

1004
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,810
use Network behavior to help figure out

1005
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,490
which clients we need to visit because

1006
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:16,170
we know the clients are all vulnerable

1007
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:19,200
and today it's coming so yeah I'm not

1008
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:21,030
ready to just tear down my firewall in

1009
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,529
fact I'm starting to believe that we're

1010
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,300
gonna have to make every firewall more

1011
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,520
complicated in the way as I've described

1012
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,280
and that we're gonna have to extend that

1013
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,660
complexity to every home and that's you

1014
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,910
know later all of you are going to do

1015
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,799
what I do just to run a network in your

1016
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,170
virtual machines in your laptop and

1017
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,510
control your own network even when you

1018
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,280
are mobile because that's what it's

1019
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,850
going to mean to have freedom in the

1020
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,180
future I want to say complexity is

1021
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:50,850
expensive every increase in Q in that

1022
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:53,339
equation is an increase in your risk

1023
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,200
management costs or your risks

1024
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,840
themselves if you choose not to manage

1025
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,669
them so every bit of logic that you add

1026
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,670
to your firewall or your hosts or

1027
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:05,280
whatever is going to drain resources and

1028
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,350
you should think carefully before doing

1029
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,790
that you can often make a bigger

1030
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:11,190
difference in your live secure

1031
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:16,500
by turning off older hosts than bi and

1032
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:19,710
buying a more expensive firewall so this

1033
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:24,360
guy is the actual source of the quote

1034
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:27,570
about a man in England at a certain time

1035
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:30,470
was to be considered a king in his own

1036
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:33,150
home which was to be treated as a castle

1037
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:36,509
he did not foresee information

1038
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:37,950
technology either because this is

1039
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:40,410
manifestly untrue

1040
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:43,919
you have got microphones in your smart

1041
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:46,080
TVs that are sending ambient room noise

1042
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,150
to people you don't have contracts with

1043
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,620
which means you have no recourse no

1044
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,810
matter what use they make of the

1045
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:56,660
information and that's before the TV is

1046
00:46:51,810 --> 00:47:00,779
also running a Bitcoin miner in its

1047
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:04,080
JavaScript interpreter so if you're not

1048
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:07,320
worried about this then you're gonna be

1049
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:13,470
meat for the people who are aware of it

1050
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:16,140
so I've packed a lot of information into

1051
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:18,330
a very short period of time I understand

1052
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,950
that it sounds crazy and I understand

1053
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,110
that not everyone is going to think

1054
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:26,939
about the butterfly effects of every act

1055
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:29,430
that they commit I do and it takes a lot

1056
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:32,310
of effort but not everyone will most

1057
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:35,100
people just want to get in innovate

1058
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:37,920
somewhere make their money and get out I

1059
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:40,020
would like people to think a little bit

1060
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,660
more about the systemic costs of the

1061
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,640
inventions that they release into our

1062
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:48,060
world

1063
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:50,549
DNS is the only system of its kind it's

1064
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,830
the only distributed coherent reliable

1065
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:55,080
autonomous hierarchical database ever

1066
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:59,190
and now that I see the way people are

1067
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:02,700
using it I think it may be the last and

1068
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:05,220
these are these are ugly times we have a

1069
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,980
lot of polarization and extremism in our

1070
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,330
politics most people don't want to talk

1071
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,210
to each other anymore because they're

1072
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:16,380
afraid of what divisions might quickly

1073
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,910
erupt and the idea that we're that code

1074
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,280
is law

1075
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:21,830
and that if Mozilla can get away with it

1076
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,860
then that's the new world is pretty

1077
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:27,049
brutal do take a look at those two

1078
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,850
websites you should know how to run your

1079
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:31,310
own recursive name server I want to say

1080
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,990
by nine takes no config file at the

1081
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:34,279
moment to get it to do the right thing

1082
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,509
you can have one but if you run it

1083
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,820
without a config file you get a

1084
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:39,890
recursive name server that does DNS SEC

1085
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:44,080
run one of those on a Raspberry Pi

1086
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:47,330
inside your house please and if you were

1087
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,970
into then monitoring it and telling it

1088
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:53,990
what not to answer take a look at DNS

1089
00:48:49,970 --> 00:49:05,450
tap and DNS rpz and that's my that's my

1090
00:48:53,990 --> 00:49:06,470
talk no one has come to throw us out so

1091
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:31,160
I'm assuming that we have time for

1092
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:33,770
questions so there's a lot there's an

1093
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:37,850
obvious concern for any company in the

1094
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:40,490
passive DNS field that something like do

1095
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:42,350
H is going to cause us to go dark and a

1096
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:45,620
lot of queries are going to bypass us

1097
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:47,750
and that turns out not to be true

1098
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:50,240
because we are not in the surveillance

1099
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:52,700
business we never see an end-user query

1100
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,560
all of our collection comes from

1101
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,049
recursive name server operators that

1102
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,060
choose to cooperate with us we never

1103
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,520
gather anything without full permission

1104
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,890
and ever anything that personally

1105
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,900
identifies anybody you can't start an

1106
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:08,480
investigation using my services you can

1107
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,180
only progress one and I get complaints

1108
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,220
from law enforcement from time to time

1109
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,560
especially the ones who are in the

1110
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,600
online child abuse materials business

1111
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,450
where they are

1112
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,880
saying but dr. Vixia would really help

1113
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:23,560
us a lot to know where that query at ENS

1114
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,690
query came from if we could just narrow

1115
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,160
it down to what metro it was it would

1116
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,600
help us find the person who's looking

1117
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,770
that stuff up and hurting children

1118
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:37,690
thereby and you know I have no love for

1119
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:39,580
criminals but I can't collect personally

1120
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,710
identifiable information if I want to

1121
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,600
have full coverage that's the choice I

1122
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:46,420
make how much of the DNS pattern space

1123
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:49,180
will I see or how well will I be able to

1124
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,220
identify where where he came from so in

1125
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,859
any case the cooperation that I have

1126
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:56,470
seen is continuing is increasing our

1127
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,030
network is growing other passive DNS

1128
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,790
networks are growing I don't believe

1129
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:03,190
that do H is going to make a big

1130
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:05,350
difference to us it is going to make a

1131
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:08,530
big difference to networks that used to

1132
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:10,569
be able to comply with whatever

1133
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,670
compliance regulatory regime they had

1134
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:14,950
whatever local laws they had whatever

1135
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,630
corporate policy or family policy they

1136
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,970
had those people are going to get

1137
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,650
bypassed but they weren't our previously

1138
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:26,169
cooperating with me anyway

1139
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:29,050
so yes I know that I have definite

1140
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:31,300
interest in monitoring the DNS and if

1141
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:33,970
the growth of the panel the portion of

1142
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,400
the pattern space that I see ever stops

1143
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:37,959
then I might even get a little bit more

1144
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,270
shrill about this what I'm trying to do

1145
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:43,780
right now is to say I've been working on

1146
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:45,340
DNS since the late 80s written some RFC

1147
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,380
is I've written some code I've started

1148
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:50,410
some companies and it's been very

1149
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:52,570
rewarding it's it's like an

1150
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:55,690
n-dimensional puzzle where n changes

1151
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:58,660
from place to place in time to time and

1152
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:00,040
it's just it's a delightful problem it

1153
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,379
would be my hobby if it wasn't my

1154
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,850
profession I'm just asking people please

1155
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:06,270
don't make it harder to keep this thing

1156
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,270
working

1157
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,419
if there are no other questions then

1158
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:18,390
I'll say that we can stop the tape and

1159
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:20,200
I'll see you all at the reception in an

1160
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:28,000
hour

1161
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:28,000
[Applause]
