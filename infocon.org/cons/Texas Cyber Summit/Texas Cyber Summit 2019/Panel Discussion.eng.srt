1
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,230
thank you we're gonna get started with

2
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,420
our afternoon panel this is our C so

3
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,760
panel on data protection privacy and

4
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,320
other top concerns for CISOs so I'm

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,150
gonna start with some introductions to

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,910
our esteemed panelists here to my left

7
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:52,000
and so I'll go from my left farther so

8
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:57,010
I'll start Jason with you oh I'm Jason

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,220
Street I am NOT a C so I am here as the

10
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,250
things he says hate the most probably

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,850
I'm the the wrench with the monkey and

12
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:09,310
the you know the gum on the shoe kind of

13
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:12,280
thing in the works so I think I'm just

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,650
here just to you know aggravate the

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,049
other two panelists so sorry about that

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:20,860
advance to be the seaso foil

17
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:22,600
yes hi everybody my name is giovanni

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,520
corleone I'm the Texas state

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,130
representative for Northeast Tarrant

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,259
County I'm not a SISO either worse I'm

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,750
from the government but I'm here to help

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:43,770
on cyber security and cyber security

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:47,320
issues from the government not as much I

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,750
think it was this way okay

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,029
as if ever so I'm John Wardley and I'm

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:56,110
from worldwide technology I am NOT a

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,360
SISO either I'm a client executive and I

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:03,310
support our customer at the National

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,100
Security Agency thank you so we're gonna

30
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,649
start with basically a softball question

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,119
on big trends so as you look across some

32
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,860
of the big tech trends that we see today

33
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,459
and I'm talking things like digital

34
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,209
transformation big data automation

35
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,730
artificial intelligence

36
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,470
take your pick so what do you think has

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,599
the most potential to help the security

38
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,530
office today or what trend do you think

39
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,799
is really not getting enough attention

40
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,150
and it should be it's maybe John I'll

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,420
start with you

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,480
I'm sorry I can't I can barely hear your

43
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,859
question the question is for if you

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,359
think about the big trends of today so

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,940
started with things like digital

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,390
transformation Big Data artificial

47
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,959
intelligence automation there's a number

48
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,548
take your pick

49
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,830
which one do you think has the greatest

50
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:49,900
potential to benefit the security team

51
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,830
the Cecil's office today or is there

52
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,930
something you think that just isn't

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:57,040
getting an attention that should be I

54
00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:00,250
think the big data and the orchestration

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,200
of Big Data there is so much that has to

56
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,380
be collected in order to evaluate what's

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,869
going on so you have an automation issue

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,250
with that that and the orchestration of

59
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,480
all the tools that are available out

60
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:17,220
there to those today there is just

61
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,899
simply no way you can go at this problem

62
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,640
with manpower you're going to have to

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,170
have automation in there behind the

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,629
works to support it thank you

65
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,780
for me it's interesting talking about

66
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:35,170
new technologies when some of our state

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,510
agencies in Texas we have 220 state

68
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,160
agencies one of our bigger one and one

69
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,530
our more important ones is a Railroad

70
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,260
Commission which does Island gas their

71
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,180
mainframe was built in 1968 and still

72
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,429
running our Department of Family

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,299
Protective Services has equipment from

74
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:56,079
the 1970s and they spend about 60% of

75
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,540
their IT budget on COBOL contractors and

76
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,560
other consultants so I'd like to be able

77
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,328
to get to the point where we're talking

78
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,169
about whether we should choose AI or

79
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:07,239
some some other technology but I think

80
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,090
for us at the state and probably for

81
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:14,139
others it really gets down to basic

82
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,358
things like do we have good compliance

83
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,510
and oversight but also communication

84
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,519
between different departments we have

85
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,159
all these different agencies that are

86
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,160
siloed probably in a lot of ways like

87
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,110
your companies might be and breaking

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,850
through those barriers is there's a step

89
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,850
we need to get to before we start

90
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,740
talking about how to get super

91
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,820
sophisticated equipment to work on

92
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,780
security I think it's just basic

93
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,550
blocking and tackling so for us I think

94
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,049
the things not getting enough play is

95
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,450
it's like we keep trying to get

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,220
technology to solve our people problem

97
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,830
instead of giving we're people to solve

98
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,300
our technology problem it's like I think

99
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,430
educating users and getting them

100
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,720
invested in being part of the security

101
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,310
team which they don't understand they

102
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,620
are because we're not taking the time to

103
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,020
educate them on that because they think

104
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,270
that you know Big Data machine learning

105
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,650
your AI is going to be solving you know

106
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,940
the problems so they don't have to worry

107
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,549
about it so let's click all the links

108
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,170
and see what happens I think that's

109
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,610
what's causing a big problem it's like

110
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,490
because they don't see the repercussions

111
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,370
of what their actions are so I think

112
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,070
it's before we get involved in what

113
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,990
technology we need to get invested in we

114
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,540
start investing in the people that are

115
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,510
already there first and then go from

116
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,270
there so that that's greatly done to our

117
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,490
my next question which was the CISOs

118
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,080
today's security teams have a great

119
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,970
responsibility to build cyber security

120
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,260
cyber security awareness with their

121
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,670
business partners have to build bridges

122
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,680
to people in the other parts of the

123
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,240
organization so what do you think are

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,950
some of the best practices or ways of

125
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,060
building those bridges to communicate

126
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,900
with people in other parts of the

127
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,650
organization also I think one of the

128
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,729
biggest ways is to get information

129
00:05:52,650 --> 00:06:00,340
security to understand just exactly how

130
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,420
bad they're failing their companies by

131
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:08,619
not educating and bringing on board

132
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:11,350
their dirt every employee is a intrusion

133
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,570
detection unit they are they do the same

134
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,060
job over and over and over if anything

135
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,770
goes wrong or goes unusual they're going

136
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,470
to detect it first because it's part of

137
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,680
their daily job but are they empowered

138
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,440
or educated to actually report that kind

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,980
of incident do they know who to contact

140
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,200
I was

141
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,060
robbing a bank in Amman Jordan and the

142
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,520
manager knew that I wasn't supposed to

143
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,260
be there knew that I wasn't and I was

144
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,789
agreeing with her that I wasn't supposed

145
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,580
to be there the whole time

146
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,280
installing malware onto her machine and

147
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,960
because she didn't know who to call she

148
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,809
had no idea who to call she didn't know

149
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,130
who to talk to so I just kept doing it

150
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,020
smiling those I'm yeah you're right I

151
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,520
shouldn't be here this we should

152
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,260
definitely call so I do you know who to

153
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,520
God I don't I mean I'm not supposed to

154
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,630
be here doing this it's like if you

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,099
don't know that you shouldn't be calling

156
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,409
someone cuz I shouldn't be doing and I

157
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,850
just kept doing that it's like because

158
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,710
they did not know who to call they

159
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,620
didn't feel empowered to actually stop

160
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,430
what was going on so if you try to start

161
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,170
treating your employees as a asset to

162
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,910
your security program instead of just

163
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,980
saying that reliability and writing them

164
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:21,020
off that would create a lot more value

165
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,910
Wow maybe four or five years ago is when

166
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,370
I really started to focus on cyber

167
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,350
security and other issues and Kindler I

168
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,870
have a tech background but really what

169
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,530
kind of got me involved in marrying that

170
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:38,810
legislation is we were in a political

171
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:40,250
fight and one side had hired they ended

172
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,170
up spending about a million dollars to

173
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,660
hire P eyes and other people to kind of

174
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,010
follow us around right they had the

175
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,720
hidden cameras and microphones the

176
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,450
telephoto lenses everywhere we were

177
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,480
going and as part of them doing that for

178
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,430
six months at one point they come into

179
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,680
all of our offices our offices are in

180
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,890
the Capitol we are publicly available so

181
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,800
anybody can come in and they drop them

182
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,990
off a bunch of USB sticks while we were

183
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,020
down at the Capitol and of course my

184
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,490
staff knows not to do it but I was at

185
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,090
that time I was like hey does anybody

186
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,800
know the potential risk here right and

187
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,739
what I discovered was that at our

188
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,450
Capitol we have physical security right

189
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,850
we have DPS that will come in a moment's

190
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,890
notice but no one was getting shot so

191
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,990
that didn't apply there was nothing

192
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,960
broken with our system so that wasn't

193
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,200
their job either and in that process I

194
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,069
figured out that we didn't have

195
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,200
a way for our public safety folks to

196
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,850
communicate with our staff folks to

197
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,800
communicate with their IT folks and

198
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,900
ultimately what we ended up doing was

199
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,800
finding out we had a hire a cyber

200
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,990
security assist oh for the Texas capital

201
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,979
and for the facilities and now as part

202
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,960
of that he in this case has to sign off

203
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,910
on all the plans and all the programs

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,490
and so on and so that he knows that he

205
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,980
is responsible for any attacks or

206
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,770
anything that that's going on in there

207
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,680
and so now putting that accountability

208
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,560
on an individual now makes it his job to

209
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,030
go and find out how we can work with dps

210
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,770
and how because at the end of the day

211
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:21,930
it's his signature on the line well

212
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:25,900
that's very interesting I recently had

213
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:28,510
lunch with the CEO for constellation

214
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,670
energy and their biggest concerns are

215
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,730
are of those natures and and legal

216
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,310
compliance but what they've also what

217
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:39,490
they've also identified is insider

218
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,989
threat is a huge huge problem they see

219
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,680
that as the biggest threat they don't

220
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:50,170
see attacks from the outside coming in

221
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:53,650
but compliance and the compliance and

222
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:59,620
the actual establishment of policy is a

223
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,939
big problem there so in this case when

224
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,470
humans are such a big part of the

225
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,970
equation and the needs to be some

226
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,460
persuasion you know of the

227
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,830
organization's security matters what do

228
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,330
you apply to your value analysis or what

229
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,370
do you try to help clients or customers

230
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,990
apply to their value analysis for how

231
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:19,030
they should value security and made it

232
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:21,160
do something about it so when you look

233
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,199
at the think broadly about like ROI of

234
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,209
security and an organization is trying

235
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,950
to put a number on well how how much are

236
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,080
we going to invest what is it for what

237
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,520
does the value analysis look like and

238
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,470
how do you help them with that so that

239
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,939
they start to place greater importance

240
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,100
and more importantly budget dollars on

241
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,810
it so I I have decided that I want to

242
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,810
work and specialize on this field and

243
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,319
the legislature there's doctors there's

244
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:49,160
as others and so I've been working on

245
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,570
cyber and IT issue so we have in Texas

246
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,510
biennial budget which means it's a

247
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,100
two-year budget that we do at the

248
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,750
beginning so will show up in January

249
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,880
we're told how much money we can spend

250
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,800
and then by May we've got to write the

251
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,140
budget for the next two full years and

252
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,329
so this session I was the subcommittee

253
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,990
chair for appropriations on anything

254
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,750
computer related or IT related and so

255
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,670
it's an interesting topic because the

256
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,000
answer is how much do we decide for me

257
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:20,819
is how much I can I can get right we

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,589
decide our priorities based upon what

259
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,330
voters tell us right and so if voters

260
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,339
say you know what we need to make sure

261
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,750
that we can find healthcare more we can

262
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,610
fund roads more in that kind of stuff

263
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,640
but what we have been able to do in

264
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:35,730
Texas is is dedicate more and more of

265
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,330
our efforts towards funding improvements

266
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,400
in IT and in cybersecurity we have at

267
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,080
any time about ten billion dollars in IT

268
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,650
contracts but I'll just explain kind of

269
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,470
the problems that we do it is since we

270
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,550
have a two-year budget what that means

271
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,200
is we'll go and we'll get an IT

272
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,240
assessment done and let's say our

273
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,130
agencies and we do it on a calendar so

274
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,130
we'll get about 20 or 30 to start doing

275
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,780
it each year that's what we can set

276
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,310
aside for it and then it takes about

277
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,550
three months to do the full assessment

278
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,589
and then those those folks will say okay

279
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,530
this is the kind of equipment or the

280
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,000
kind of people that you need to do by

281
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,579
well then they have to wait until we

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,770
show up starting in October November to

283
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,530
start getting it we show up in January

284
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,620
then we approve or not approve it then

285
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,780
by May we say yes and then they have to

286
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,010
go out for a public bid okay and that

287
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,170
might take another six or nine months

288
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,839
before they do it from the moment that

289
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,209
we identify that there's a need a

290
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,230
critical need in one of our agencies to

291
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:39,209
when we actually fund it if we do it's

292
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,550
about a year and a half is what it takes

293
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:45,209
and in that time to potential problems

294
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,670
are one the the issue is still there but

295
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,529
to since we're a public government a lot

296
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,079
of that information gets disclosed to

297
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,970
folks

298
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:57,099
now know what some of our main Asians oh

299
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,899
I'd be curious to see what percentage of

300
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,389
that budget actually is dedicated to

301
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,399
cybersecurity when you when given its

302
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:06,220
can be treated as the redheaded

303
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,660
stepchild when it's just not the sexy

304
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,089
thing that there's going to get the

305
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,639
results they're going after in terms of

306
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:15,730
mission focus how do you convince them

307
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,939
that they need to invest in well I think

308
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,709
we're a lot of information security

309
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:22,599
departments have a problem with is it's

310
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:26,378
trying to communicate to executive

311
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,879
management what those are because we get

312
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:32,619
this policy that we have to try to get

313
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:35,470
executive management to understand what

314
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:37,119
the problem is in terms that we

315
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,069
understand because we're tackling we

316
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:41,049
know better we know it and that's not

317
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,059
going to work it's like we need to start

318
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:44,319
communicating in ways that executive

319
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:46,420
management understands you can't keep

320
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,790
going up to the budget into the budget

321
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,378
and say the end of the year say hey we

322
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,118
need two extra million dollars notice

323
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,249
how nothing happened really big happened

324
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:56,379
last year well if you want nothing else

325
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:58,059
to happen next year it's like we need

326
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:59,679
this was running and I just got there

327
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:03,549
talking about this in my talk it's like

328
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,079
we need to start giving out pie it's

329
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,029
like you know who doesn't love pie it's

330
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,549
like start doing pie charts showing up

331
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,689
numbers showing how many firewall hits

332
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,910
hit the firewall

333
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:15,998
how many IDs alerts went off how many

334
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,610
spam are emails were quarantined in the

335
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,529
gateway filter how many systems are

336
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,499
passed currently and how many more need

337
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:25,509
to be passed currently those are like

338
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:28,029
nonsensical numbers at first but what

339
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:30,519
they do is they generate hard evidence

340
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,559
that something's going on it gives

341
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,980
tangible proof that there's an issue and

342
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,949
once you have that you couple it with

343
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,379
Target and Sony and you bring up hard

344
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:43,719
evidence of how much a company is lost

345
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,389
that is not you or not your enterprise

346
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,669
and say let's not be these people

347
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,639
it's like Target lost over 300 billion

348
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:54,549
dollars it's like Experian lost over

349
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,839
20,000 identities it's like being the

350
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:57,459
state legislature it's like you know

351
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,339
it's like our citizens poll information

352
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,989
was opened up or it's like or or the tax

353
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,000
day that was was left open

354
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,490
and exposed on the server it's like you

355
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,620
show them what tangibly could happen if

356
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,270
this stuff is not addressed give them

357
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,830
numbers showing that you are doing

358
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,290
something and something's actually being

359
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,060
done and then you work with that to try

360
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,439
to get that budget approved you know

361
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,719
you're absolutely right you have to show

362
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,170
what impact that his head or could have

363
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,660
and for a long time I was a tinfoil hat

364
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,760
guy saying the sky is falling well about

365
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,350
a month ago 21 different government

366
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,060
entities in Texas were hit by an

367
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:35,860
organized attack the ransomware attack

368
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,029
hit mostly in law enforcement it was the

369
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,970
first time the stay stood up its

370
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:44,500
computer cases military department

371
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,320
division to go and help in that

372
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,080
assistant we saw actual physical damages

373
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,230
to these organizations and so the good

374
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,300
news okay in a way is that it's going to

375
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,890
be a lot easier now yeah for me to go

376
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,660
usually has to be something for that

377
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,580
biggest assets like I mean they're there

378
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,459
and it's unfortunate that's the way it

379
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,930
is but you have to build off that it's

380
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,969
like don't let it like you know two

381
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,010
years from now and it'd be a faded

382
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,300
memory and people forget it has to be

383
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,130
something that's been constantly forced

384
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:17,109
remember that one time we got all mocked

385
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:19,420
offline yeah that's great so I think

386
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,399
that's now let's look at getting ahead

387
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,020
of these attacks and threat intelligence

388
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,360
and the sharing of threat intelligence

389
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,829
and so the question is how important do

390
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,829
you think threat intelligence sharing is

391
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:34,959
across organizations and how do you see

392
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:36,300
CISOs or security teams go about doing

393
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,880
that today

394
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,079
maybe gee oh honey I'll start with you

395
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,290
are you talking about sharing

396
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:46,810
information across enterprises across

397
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,420
from business as to others that's an

398
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:54,219
interesting question because the agency

399
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:56,709
that I support is as everything is very

400
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,660
sensitive and they're seeing things on

401
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,130
the cutting edge of technology or their

402
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,620
throughout the cutting edge of attacks

403
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,470
that are coming their way

404
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:09,520
that they can't necessarily share with

405
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:12,069
industry so but they they're looking at

406
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,730
ways of sanitizing that and actually

407
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,109
getting it out and sharing

408
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,849
sharing it across the enterprises so

409
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:22,229
where they will come up with a way to

410
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:24,750
thwart an attack maybe it's they can't

411
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,640
they can't share it or maybe there's

412
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,040
some proprietary reasons where one

413
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,570
company won't share with another so

414
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,300
these are boundaries that we're going to

415
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:36,330
have just because of the of the nature

416
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:40,710
of business in the United States today

417
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:42,300
so I guess consortiums of sis's are

418
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:47,430
going to share this information with

419
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,930
each other regulation I suppose

420
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,960
regulations couldn't have to make them

421
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:55,760
accountable I would say from an

422
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,760
information security standpoint is

423
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,350
incorporating an incident response plan

424
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,709
to start actually open communications

425
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,020
between the different departments it's I

426
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:10,950
understand that there are certain tasks

427
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,680
that it's not the old model of incident

428
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,500
response and disaster recovery is you

429
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,680
know HR executives marketing it's like

430
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,840
for PR and the IT to president start

431
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,030
understanding that each department has

432
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,439
to be involved in it each corporation

433
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,389
has to be if there's a major thing

434
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,750
especially when it comes to like on the

435
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:33,090
grand scale thing like with different

436
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,920
industries it's like there's InfraGard

437
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,780
which is like trying to get involved

438
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,960
with all these different private sector

439
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,100
in case a huge catastrophe occurs or

440
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,680
someone that so they're trying to get

441
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,909
that involved and it's it's based on

442
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,440
incident response we don't like to talk

443
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,210
about that part because that's scary

444
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,040
part where something Bad's happen but

445
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,780
the whole point of information security

446
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,030
is prevented by acknowledging the fact

447
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,740
that it can happen it's like getting the

448
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,389
executives to understand that something

449
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,310
bad can happen and it needs to be

450
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,930
responded to and getting these other

451
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,030
departments to understand that hey

452
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,190
they're part of that if something bad

453
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,600
does happen it's like I think that's

454
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,690
where you start getting them and start

455
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,280
doing role tabletop exercises start

456
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,960
having exercises where you're actually

457
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,580
communicating and having an actual

458
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,070
meeting before the bad thing actually

459
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,960
happens and start actually opening up

460
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,460
those channels of communications it's

461
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,900
like I shouldn't have to go move through

462
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,400
a book to see who's actually and

463
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,250
all day in this it's like I should be

464
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,050
able to know I've met you know Barbara

465
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,270
she's a head of this department it's

466
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,290
like I can go talk to her when it

467
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,150
happens because we've already

468
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,420
established out that relationship it's

469
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:40,450
like oh I know John over here this it's

470
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,280
like I know Bob does this action it's

471
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,900
like let's go and communicate with these

472
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,850
people it's like because we've already

473
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,470
established relationship not like let me

474
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,540
find a number let me make sure it's the

475
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,340
right number make sure it's something

476
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,600
that's supposed to go on so I think we

477
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,399
just need to develop more of a

478
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,969
communication thing before an actual

479
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,610
event occurs but for us here in Texas

480
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:04,420
over the past year or so we've been hit

481
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:07,810
by a variety of really tragic massacres

482
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,480
quite frankly at schools in El Paso and

483
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,950
Odessa even more recently and so what

484
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,630
we've done is we've created this

485
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,370
committee it's got a long name but

486
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,070
basically it's about mass violence and

487
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,290
mass violence prevention and this is one

488
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,780
of the things that you know you've never

489
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,639
even planned on working on and so in

490
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,910
this process earlier today was one of

491
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,250
our first hearings in law rezaian Dallas

492
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,410
and we started having this conversation

493
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,050
about how do you share these threats

494
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,700
from one organization to another and in

495
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,470
our case that's an organization called

496
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,940
local law enforcement and another

497
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,390
organization called social media

498
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:47,230
companies and so there was an example of

499
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:49,030
something where and Dallas someone had

500
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,040
gone on Twitter and I as part of this

501
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,620
Joker you know the the movie that's

502
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,970
coming out as part of that just they saw

503
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,989
this tweet where someone's like hey I

504
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,200
hear there's gonna be a whole bunch of

505
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:01,630
girls at the 10 a 10 p.m. showing at

506
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,610
this Dallas movie theater and put a kind

507
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,170
of scary picture of a clown on there so

508
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,490
that kind of raised some red flags and

509
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,560
some people started a report at least

510
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,470
that initial part to the police

511
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,440
department well the second post by that

512
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,810
individual was he had covered his face

513
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,240
and makeup to look like the Joker and he

514
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,919
had a handgun that he was holding by his

515
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,930
head and he said I'll see you guys all

516
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,130
at 10 o'clock okay so what we've

517
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,110
discovered is that there was not any

518
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,760
good communication between the Dallas

519
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,979
Police Department and Twitter and how to

520
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,960
actually access that person it ended up

521
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,820
taking about 16 hours

522
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,000
which is about 14 hours after 10 o'clock

523
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,769
and for us what we're trying to work on

524
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,539
and it may just come down to regulation

525
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:43,669
or laws and saying hey there are certain

526
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:45,379
situations where we're going to require

527
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,210
this information we're gonna obviously

528
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,190
you know respect the Fourth Amendment

529
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,549
and our Constitution and have probable

530
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:55,100
cause but we have to have a standardized

531
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,929
way where we can contact not just

532
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,309
Twitter because today is Twitter its

533
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,590
Facebook its whatever there's going to

534
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,080
be a standardized way where law

535
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,668
enforcement or wherever else that needs

536
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,230
to get access to it can have a direct

537
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:11,480
constitutionally protected line to get

538
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,000
that those threat assessments and share

539
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,220
it and then figure out quickly if that

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,100
was a real threat or just you know a

541
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,409
prank or what-have-you

542
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,740
well thank you so I guess we're we're

543
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:28,010
very good at post event forensics right

544
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,840
right now I mean it's also clear after

545
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:32,120
the fact how this should have never

546
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,470
happened in way who didn't connect the

547
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,959
dots and we've been hearing that since

548
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:39,049
9/11 it's been incredible we had a guy

549
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,210
in my district okay he had been posting

550
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:43,250
for months that he wanted to kill the

551
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,260
president United States showing pictures

552
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,510
of himself on Facebook with guns and all

553
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,389
that other kind of stuff for six months

554
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,429
finally gets arrested the next day I go

555
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:54,168
on Facebook I find the guy and here

556
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,380
unless you're straight out saying gay

557
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:59,299
I'm like man I spell Facebook wrong

558
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,919
Facebook kind of digs me on it and says

559
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:09,908
that I need to fix it but how do we not

560
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:12,529
have ahead of time it's an intense topic

561
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:14,059
to switch gears a little bit over to the

562
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:15,710
the talent science of the people that

563
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,519
are responsible for trying to prevent

564
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,830
these attacks

565
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,029
so what technical and soft skills do you

566
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,240
think security teams really need to

567
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:26,779
develop maybe Jason I'll start with you

568
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,779
I mean one of the biggest skills that

569
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:34,159
are lacking in information security is

570
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:39,919
just human interaction empathy it's like

571
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:41,120
understanding that that and I and I I

572
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,620
have to be honest with you it's like

573
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,428
when I first started in information

574
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,889
security I saw it

575
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,600
because I came from a physical security

576
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:49,949
and won't working kind of side of it

577
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,559
where I was dealing with like you know

578
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,490
future perps it's like I was like oh

579
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,869
what are they gonna do what are they

580
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,610
gonna screw up it's like what are they

581
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,840
gonna it's like so I did not have much

582
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,939
empathy because it's like I didn't know

583
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,590
when they were gonna make a mistake it's

584
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,509
like it that was a failing on my part

585
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,999
it's like we need to start understanding

586
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:08,070
that we need to approach the whole thing

587
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:11,460
with these are people that are on our

588
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,869
team the day one that they're hired they

589
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,269
need to understand that they are part of

590
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,860
the security team and if they don't

591
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:18,960
understand that and they don't feel like

592
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,119
that's one of their job responsibilities

593
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,259
well then they're gonna click they're

594
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,908
gonna click on Elyse it's like it's not

595
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:25,409
their job it's like you know they are

596
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:27,749
only going to do things that are

597
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:29,340
required to keep them employed so they

598
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:31,379
can feed and clothe their children it's

599
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,879
like if we're trying to say these are

600
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:35,459
the things you need to do to be employed

601
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:39,178
they're going to do that we have not

602
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,159
given them the impetus that being

603
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,619
security-conscious it's like being

604
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,629
cautious with emails it's also a job

605
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:49,168
requirement so therefore if it's not a

606
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:51,809
job requirement it is nonsense for them

607
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:54,570
to try to do so I think we have to get

608
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:57,299
better at doing communication better at

609
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,039
opening up and talking in a way that we

610
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,330
show empathy to play look I understand

611
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,759
that you've got a lot of different job

612
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,320
responsibilities I understand that this

613
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,299
stuff is new to you it's like I

614
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,700
understand that this is this is a new

615
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:10,408
technology that we and we can say all we

616
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,570
want about computers like oh they've

617
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:15,480
been around for 20 years like that it's

618
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:19,110
a you have to remember how many people

619
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,830
died everyday in car accidents in the

620
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:26,580
1940s and 1950s in the 1960s and in the

621
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:29,699
1970s until the 1970s and 80s where

622
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,580
people started actually going hey if we

623
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,009
had a seatbelt maybe people would die as

624
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,658
much you know it's like maybe if we were

625
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:38,940
to make it so we just crumpled in and

626
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,340
killed people it's like maybe we could

627
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,799
you know do something about that so it's

628
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,649
like it took 30 or 40 years with that

629
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,929
new technology you know of the horseless

630
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:50,340
carriage to actually start getting the

631
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,619
security implementation - getting people

632
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,000
to understand it and be aware of it it's

633
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:57,030
like so this is

634
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,770
this is another technological revolution

635
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,389
that people are still getting grasp on

636
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,790
and they're still getting trying to

637
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,320
understand properly and they don't and

638
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,570
it's like so therefore we have to let

639
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,700
them know and show them how they're

640
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,830
responsible for it and educate them on

641
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,940
that in a way that's not showing them

642
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,830
that we think they're going to be

643
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,690
screwing up but that we're trying to

644
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:23,699
help facilitate and help them do their

645
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:25,080
job better I I think that's that's right

646
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,490
I mean if you mean if you ask the

647
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,540
average person in their job let's say

648
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,370
I'll take an example from you at the

649
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,320
bank what's your job it's to support the

650
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,370
customer is to make sure that I'd you

651
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,379
know give them the right amount of money

652
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,540
it's that I go and listen to the boss

653
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,690
but cybersecurity doesn't show up in

654
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,980
their top ten time draw any ideas so one

655
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,660
of the things that we worked on in the

656
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,090
agency each one of the Texas agencies

657
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:48,870
whether it's DPS DMV or whatever they go

658
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,790
through we call it sunset where we every

659
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,070
agency every 10 years has to kind of

660
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:56,670
defend its existence they we go through

661
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:58,169
a full top-down bottom-up review of each

662
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,550
agency that they're following all of

663
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,530
their core missions and our core

664
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:04,620
missions or I've always been 12 you know

665
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,770
are you doing what is in your charter

666
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,120
are you doing you have the right

667
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,320
employees are you auditing all of your

668
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,879
books and all that kind of stuff and so

669
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,220
what we do at the end of every session

670
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,810
is we look and say have they met all 12

671
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,180
parts of their mission statement in it

672
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,159
so we are going to continue this agency

673
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,500
and if they haven't we shut it down and

674
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,050
so what I did is I added number 13 which

675
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,130
is cyber security make sure that as part

676
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,050
of their mission statement and

677
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,300
everything that they're doing their job

678
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,770
will not exist if they're not making

679
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,590
sure that the data that they're

680
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:37,710
protecting still exists very interesting

681
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:41,510
ok well the biggest problem in all this

682
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:45,750
is that we're constrained by ethics and

683
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:50,010
our adversaries are not and we're on a

684
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:52,110
defensive posture from the start and you

685
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:56,490
can't be on the defensive posture and

686
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,620
win this battle this war we're going to

687
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,970
always be on the losing side of it so

688
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,489
it's going to be dynamic and it's always

689
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,790
going to be changing until we start

690
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,460
figuring out a way to legally and that

691
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:11,710
we hit back at our adversaries and make

692
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:14,150
it hurt them as they come and attack us

693
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:17,630
as it stands now I mean they're not

694
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,730
constrained by any ethics they're free

695
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:22,280
to do as they please there's no policies

696
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:26,450
in place none of the things that we we

697
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:29,960
are constrained by so I think we're

698
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:32,210
right now we're still on the on the

699
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,640
learning curve for all this but we're

700
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,420
way behind and that has to be addressed

701
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,160
as well

702
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:46,400
makes me feel better I'm not very

703
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:47,720
ethically constrained of my job so as

704
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,210
we're as we're trying to look at the

705
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,520
skill sets of cybersecurity folk then

706
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,800
how do you how do you measure their

707
00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:02,690
skill sets and how do you value

708
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:05,330
certifications in your line of work how

709
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:09,310
do you value certifications I don't

710
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:11,330
I think don't get me wrong I think

711
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:14,780
certifications are very important

712
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,970
starting out it's like but especially

713
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,410
for me I wouldn't have been where I'm a

714
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,970
high school dropout he's never been to

715
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,620
college so it's like I would not have

716
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,480
probably gotten job I didn't have some

717
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,540
kind of cert behind my name with the

718
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,700
letters so I think that's important but

719
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,340
I think what we need to start focusing

720
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,610
on is not just what letters you have

721
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,620
what diploma you've got but what can you

722
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,889
actually apply when you're there it's

723
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:43,370
like I think we rely too much on

724
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:46,160
people's you know passing a bootcamp and

725
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:48,679
a course and not the ability the

726
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,570
adaptability to learn it's like it takes

727
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,840
so I think that's what we need to start

728
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,460
focusing on if I was ever interviewed

729
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,470
with a question and someone told me it's

730
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,090
like you know that if I didn't know that

731
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,400
answer it's like I would not go and say

732
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,240
I don't know it so every like I have no

733
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,010
clue what it's like but I can learn

734
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,570
give me an hour and then asked me again

735
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,250
it's like it's because I have the

736
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,129
ability to learn it I have the ability

737
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,320
to adapt to it it's like so I think that

738
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:15,149
we need to I think certifications are

739
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,389
good at a certain point and it's a fixed

740
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:21,629
time it's like a necessarily if you want

741
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:25,830
to go and I mean I took the CISSP back

742
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:28,529
in 2001 in March it's like so if you

743
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:31,740
want to know and trust me the shape and

744
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:34,140
size and the thickness of a bollard has

745
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:38,730
it you know changed that much in the

746
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:40,440
last 20 years but my the TCB protocols

747
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,240
it's like have done a little bit the

748
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,799
tools that are like now required it's

749
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,510
like I mean yeah that the fire

750
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,100
extinguishers are still the same it's

751
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,440
like that you have on the tests and some

752
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,370
of these other things but the technology

753
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,070
from 2001 first is this it's like and

754
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,620
just because I get CPEs that I can go to

755
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,330
by getting it InfraGard meanings how

756
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,729
does that make how does that qualify for

757
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,100
me happening a certification it's I can

758
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,679
be invalid on and and kurenai's it's

759
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,330
like what I say is that what we should

760
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,130
do is like have certifications that

761
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,760
actually talk about how much involvement

762
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:17,640
have you done in the community how many

763
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,110
talks have you given in an event how

764
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,640
much have you contributed because every

765
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,428
single person in this audience can

766
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,080
contribute and give a talk on a subject

767
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,149
it's like you know being that they're

768
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,399
still students or they're in the

769
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:31,350
veterans for the last 30 years in the

770
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:33,570
field they have something that they can

771
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,158
give a talk on it's like so what kind of

772
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,260
proof can you give what kind of

773
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,350
documentation can you show that you've

774
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:42,690
publicly contributed or researched a

775
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,230
topic it's like I think that's where we

776
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,090
should start

777
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,250
focusing on more about what their

778
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:51,870
involvement is not just what piece of

779
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:54,720
paper they have yeah I'm gonna have to

780
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:57,510
agree with that 100% certifications put

781
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,740
you behind the curve you there's there

782
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,289
there's some requirement for that

783
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,919
obviously the tools that you're going to

784
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:07,470
need to do the job but let's face it

785
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,620
it addresses what's already happened and

786
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,020
what's known and documented

787
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:15,320
they're truly creative people who could

788
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:18,290
go after these attacks are out there and

789
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:22,309
I know I worked in Silicon Valley for

790
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:24,950
ten years of my career and most of those

791
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:26,300
folks didn't have certifications they

792
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,809
were the best engineers and programmers

793
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:32,840
I ever met most creative people it's the

794
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:34,970
creative people you want to go after

795
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,860
this problem and I think certifications

796
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:41,630
really right now there yeah well they

797
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:46,159
just don't quite address everything

798
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:48,980
that's required they may be for us the

799
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,260
value of the certification is probably

800
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:54,830
measured more in our ability to retain

801
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,770
people and what we've seen a lot of

802
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,780
times is you know we can't especially in

803
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,280
our deal we can't pay people what

804
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,770
they're worth right so we have to

805
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,450
provide other auxilary things for them

806
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,150
to kind of stay obviously it's a

807
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,770
nine-to-five job it's something that

808
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,960
maybe has a pension and all that kind of

809
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,670
stuff but we're still struggling like

810
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,980
many of you all maybe your companies are

811
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:18,470
trying to retain really top talent in

812
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,179
this kind of environment and when I've

813
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,880
gone and I've asked people say listen I

814
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:25,550
can't pay you what what do you want and

815
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,010
we hear things like I want a way to get

816
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,379
promoted right a track to be able to go

817
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,690
up to the management hire management I

818
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,330
have found that many of them in surveys

819
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,450
have told us that a certification this

820
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:40,059
ability to just learn more and have kind

821
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,910
of a standardized way where they can

822
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:47,420
become more educated and be more rounded

823
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:49,550
is a value maybe more for the business

824
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,620
or the entity than the individual

825
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:54,320
themselves but it does help us with

826
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,360
turnover and that kind of stuff if we're

827
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,460
just in order to be able to retain and

828
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:02,689
therefore that helps us kind of have

829
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,250
some continuity of skill and people I

830
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,870
would think that you'd get better

831
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,570
retention it's like if you offered your

832
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:11,330
employees it's like if you're a job it's

833
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:14,570
like we'll give you this much time paid

834
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:17,149
time and travel expenses to go to this

835
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,919
many conferences a year it's like it's

836
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:19,569
like because quite frankly going to a

837
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,020
conference

838
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:25,060
this it's like is vital to understanding

839
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,070
it's not just going to a talk it's their

840
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,620
ability to network with other people who

841
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:32,020
have other resources that can then build

842
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,400
on that and and and bring up their

843
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,080
career by giving and sharing that

844
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,610
knowledge yes you're right that's

845
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,900
probably the right thing and in a

846
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,640
corporation but you know the only thing

847
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:42,010
is in our world that we band of being

848
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,069
called junkets is the thing and so what

849
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,780
happened with an object Astoria TABC

850
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,770
they that's what they did and and they

851
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,300
would go and they go to different

852
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,610
conventions one of them approached it

853
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:59,320
was in Hawaii okay in a long other way

854
00:34:51,610 --> 00:35:00,670
we can also yeah no I think you're right

855
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,700
I mean there's there's things like that

856
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,260
that probably are less expensive it just

857
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,609
was valuable and and that's something we

858
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:11,680
should look at that's a good point

859
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:13,960
yeah so all three of either work at or

860
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,250
serve you know large organizations and

861
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,010
those folks invest a lot in

862
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,810
cybersecurity so for the investments

863
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,550
that large organizations make what are

864
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,750
the recommendations you would make to

865
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:28,570
small medium or mid-sized businesses I

866
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:30,820
think one of the biggest things that a

867
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,750
come a small sized business or someone

868
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,180
that doesn't have a dedicated

869
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,190
information security team or maybe have

870
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,930
one guy from IT they you know that was

871
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,850
upon the Geek Squad is now every year

872
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:43,589
like who I'm the big guy I think one of

873
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:48,910
the key things that they can do are one

874
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:51,550
know every single machine they own and

875
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,560
what it's doing on their network it's

876
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,540
like doing some way to actually monitor

877
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,070
and see exactly how many machines they

878
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,509
have because if you don't know how many

879
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,450
machines you have how can you secure

880
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,760
anything second of all just make sure

881
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,680
that their auto updates are on their

882
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,960
personal firewalls on machines that came

883
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,230
with the machines are on there it's like

884
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,210
the Windows Defender it's like the

885
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,100
Windows Firewall it's like and make sure

886
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,440
they're passionate is actually up and

887
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,350
they're updating the systems every month

888
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,810
because I think that runs I mean we have

889
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,270
too much time and we glorify and we

890
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,890
romanticize the whole O'Day thing it's

891
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,370
like oh my gosh someone's dropping O'Day

892
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,710
here

893
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:33,359
someone's dropping over Oh

894
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:35,430
there it's like 8466 percent of the

895
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,180
victims of cybercrime it's like the

896
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,098
corporations

897
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,980
it's like said that they're the

898
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:44,820
vulnerability that they hit was a decade

899
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:48,089
old it's like so scurry or O'Day it's

900
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,460
like patch you're freaking 5,000 473

901
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:52,980
O'Day it's like that's the O'Day that

902
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,839
needs to get fixed it's like so we need

903
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,670
to start making sure that that system is

904
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:58,830
because that's manageable that should be

905
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,080
manageable for any corporation being

906
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,720
able to just do a regular patching of

907
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,970
their systems and also monitoring what

908
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,549
device comes on because I promise you

909
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,589
I've got like three or four devices that

910
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,940
can attach to your network and it's like

911
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:14,430
and you may want to know when they

912
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:18,240
connect it's like an if you don't you're

913
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:22,200
gonna have a bad day I had a constituent

914
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,569
they make was it called whatever it's a

915
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,470
game that they make it's like a

916
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,550
shuffleboard they're one of the big

917
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,589
chopping board this you don't think of

918
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,030
them as a tech company at all and one

919
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:31,259
day they discover which i think is

920
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,750
something that they needed to know ahead

921
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,040
of time is exactly which data was most

922
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:38,700
important for their business to continue

923
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,380
running to the next day and and you know

924
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,640
absolutely they need to know their

925
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,220
assets and all that kind of stuff but I

926
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,569
think for them what they realized is the

927
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,580
most important thing they had was the

928
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,470
numbers of all their clients and all

929
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,210
their vendors and they had put that on

930
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:54,149
the same system as they put everything

931
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,070
else and when that went away effectively

932
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,660
lost their business so I think for me

933
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,460
the most critical thing is figuring out

934
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,040
what is the data that you have you

935
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,660
cannot possibly lose and maybe that's

936
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,480
just a small subsection of it you know

937
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,879
they go may then focus on that first and

938
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,430
then then worry about everything else

939
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,640
later yeah okay so that that's

940
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:17,520
investment in infrastructure and then

941
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,770
making your management aware of what

942
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,030
what they have at stake to lose which

943
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,400
goes back to the very first thing we

944
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:25,290
talked about right making the decision

945
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,869
makers understand what this means to the

946
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,490
bottom line so surely somebody who's

947
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:32,130
making shuffle boards they're you know

948
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,049
they may not even they may have come

949
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,230
from a time when they didn't even have

950
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,220
computers they did everything on paper

951
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,720
they're not going to understand that

952
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,200
it's going to be hard for them

953
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:47,009
and that is so yeah that's very very

954
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,660
important thank you this has been really

955
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,340
insightful so I think they will close

956
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,509
with just a final thought from each of

957
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,740
you and then if there's any questions

958
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,070
from the audience we can maybe take a

959
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,720
couple of those before we close okay

960
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,920
it's like I said I thought this is

961
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,520
always going to be a problem that

962
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,130
plagues us as long as we are you know in

963
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,670
the structures we work in and we are

964
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,440
legal constraints that we have and the

965
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,349
fact that we've fostered ourself on a

966
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:17,010
defense and so we're always going to

967
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:21,030
have this problem we we need to go and

968
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:24,240
rethink a global strategy for attacking

969
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:27,300
the attackers that are coming after us

970
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,399
and being better at it than they are and

971
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,560
I think that's the only way they're ever

972
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,140
gonna win this and we we keep bolting on

973
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,060
more and more defensive you know

974
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,970
firewall here we're even getting down

975
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,890
into the silicon where we're bolting on

976
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:44,339
and we're just bolting on defense that's

977
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:47,759
it and any military leader can tell you

978
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:50,279
you know any defense can be overcome any

979
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,770
fortress any rampart can be can be

980
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,320
stormed and overcome you have to go on

981
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:59,609
the attack if you want your attackers to

982
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,109
be vanquished and I guess in closing one

983
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:04,020
I would be a good politician if I didn't

984
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:07,619
say vote for me if you live in district

985
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:10,650
98 but one of the things that I'm

986
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,650
working on for in the interim we're

987
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,270
gonna work on for the next year is

988
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,950
legislation related to data privacy in

989
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,050
general right so the state along with

990
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,399
corporations collect a lot of your data

991
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,990
and at the end of the day almost

992
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,720
everything that someone is trying to get

993
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:28,109
is access to data that data to sell that

994
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,609
data or to transfer it and so as we

995
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:32,130
start going towards the next session my

996
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:35,369
name is Giovanni I am NOT an expert at

997
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,839
this but I I take ideas that people have

998
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:38,700
especially folks that are in this

999
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:41,549
industry that you think the government

1000
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,799
is doing wrong or not as good as it

1001
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,160
should be and we're we're here to help

1002
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,780
right

1003
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,740
we really are nice that's what I said to

1004
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,280
start where that I was being sarcastic

1005
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:53,189
then but a reality is what our job is is

1006
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,990
to go and to help Public Safety and

1007
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,390
improve our security here in the state

1008
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:00,240
so the extent that you do have ideas or

1009
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:03,299
concepts it's my job to take those and

1010
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,640
to get them implemented for the state I

1011
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:08,400
would say to I'm tired of the dancing

1012
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,049
gerbils winning it's like because if I

1013
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,970
send you a link saying that there's

1014
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:14,038
dancing gerbils on the other side of

1015
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,049
that link it's like it doesn't matter

1016
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,910
what the technology says it's like you

1017
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:19,288
can have the thing that says hey this

1018
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,089
looks like it's going to suspicious

1019
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:23,910
sight do you want to continue yes or no

1020
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:25,950
and the user is then going to be the

1021
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,288
human element is still gonna be able to

1022
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:31,230
go and say well mother there's dancing

1023
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:33,630
gerbils yes it's like we have to get it

1024
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,970
where we stop are dependent on the

1025
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,799
technology trying to protect a human we

1026
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:40,470
need to make it where the employee and

1027
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:43,319
the human knows that's not going to work

1028
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:46,859
we need to not click that we need to say

1029
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:48,660
no it's like we I mean the blinky boxes

1030
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:50,308
have gotten more advanced they got blue

1031
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,509
lights instead of red lights now that's

1032
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:54,029
great

1033
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:56,490
but it's got to be more advanced on

1034
00:41:54,029 --> 00:41:58,319
actually focusing on what the humans

1035
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:00,089
doing it with the human element is and

1036
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,920
that they're educated on protecting

1037
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:03,930
themselves it's like and why it's

1038
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,430
interested to them it's like if they're

1039
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,049
still getting hit with scam where at

1040
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,058
home if they still don't know where

1041
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:10,859
their children are doing online if they

1042
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:13,650
still don't know how to secure their

1043
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:15,839
their television or their Wi-Fi router

1044
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,609
then why do you think that they're gonna

1045
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,770
take time trying to secure your stuff

1046
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:21,900
it's like you have to teach them how to

1047
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,460
protect themselves at home so they can

1048
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,500
bring that kind of security

1049
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,910
consciousness to work because they're

1050
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,910
never going to care about your data

1051
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:34,109
thank you

1052
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:35,190

00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:36,640
of the biggest problems and hindrances

1061
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:38,979
for companies trying to find security

1062
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,069

1063

what's that noise it's like no it's like

1076
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,460
you need to be able to say we're willing

1077
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:15,099
to hire someone as an entry level of

1078
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,710

the job having a desire and a passion to

1080
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:23,799
get this job done it's like I am tired

1081
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:26,710
of people going into college and and

1082
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:28,869
doing a selecting information security

1083
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,279
as their field of choice because it's

1084
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:32,109
going to be a good money opportunity

1085
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:33,910
it's like I mean yeah it's a good

1086
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:35,259
monetary but if you think if you get

1087
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,759
into information security because you

1088
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:38,229
think it's a good career choice and it's

1089
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:41,339
like it's gonna be a nine-to-five job

1090
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:44,009
you're going to suck so bad at your job

1091
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:46,799
because the people that you're attacking

1092
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,750
are having a blast the people that are

1093
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,940
coming at you and robbing you or having

1094
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,560
a field day they're playing xbox why

1095
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,720
they're waiting for the download stuff

1096
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,560
you know the latest malware it's like

1097
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,629
they're having fun

1098
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,799
it's like and you're looking at it

1099
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,270
approaching it like it's gonna talk now

1100
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,130
you need to find people that have a

1101
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,020
passion for who may not have a clue

1102
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:07,320
about what's going on it's like I

1103
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,730
started out in and as a helpdesk and a

1104
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,590
guy since I hate you want to information

1105
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,060
security I'm like yeah sounds like

1106
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,330
awesome I love going after bad guys

1107
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,410
let's do it and it's like and people

1108
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:18,509
didn't shoot at me as much so it's like

1109
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,009
awesome it's like so that's something

1110
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,960
that you have to incorporate it's like

1111
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:24,240
stop trying to say the fact all these

1112
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,310
requirements and start teaching them

1113
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,959
those requirements show them what they

1114
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,460
need to learn and what they need to have

1115
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,530
and let them go and do it

1116
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,240
and if they can't get rid of them and

1117
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,280
because there's gonna be a hundred other

1118
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,589
people to replace them that have that

1119
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,260
passion in that drive but stop with

1120
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,400
these stupid needlessly dumb

1121
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:46,830
requirements before they even get a

1122
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:50,040
chance to prove themselves yeah I see

1123
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:53,190
this in in my job everyday where I we

1124
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,200
have to recruit to fulfill a billet for

1125
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,900
a government customer and requirements

1126
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,060
that they put in front of us are frankly

1127
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,880
ridiculous how do you have 20 years of

1128
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,490
experience in this it doesn't exist

1129
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,650
anywhere they they want purple unicorns

1130
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,540
to come in and do this but in this

1131
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:13,410
structure environment so right this is a

1132
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:16,350
ground-up issue so yeah I like your

1133
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:18,450
approach very much I think for this

1134
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:20,609
state obviously we work we have

1135
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:23,430
workforce training we do computer

1136
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:25,020
literacy we're trying to put that one of

1137
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,529
the things we worked on for instance was

1138
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:30,600
there's a mandatory requirement to learn

1139
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:32,420
have language classes and it was always

1140
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,470
Spanish in English we've had a computer

1141
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,440
programming as one of the languages that

1142
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,600
I'll help you graduate we put more and

1143
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,240
more computers we have more stem schools

1144
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:45,299
and and from the elementary level on up

1145
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,819
but I'll also say this we are at the

1146
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,619
lowest recorded unemployment in the

1147
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,800
history of Texas we're at about three

1148
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:56,250
point one percent DFW area where I live

1149
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,770
where a 2.8 percent no one can get a job

1150
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,600
and right now if you go there for a no

1151
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:03,870
one can I'm sorry knowing can hire

1152
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:06,960
anybody easily in West Texas right now

1153
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:10,109
in the Permian basis Basin area we have

1154
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,580
teachers teacher shortage of about 200

1155
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,260
teachers in their school district

1156
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,720
because they make a heck of a lot more

1157
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,870
money working in the oil fields than

1158
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,279
they do in school and today it's a

1159
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:24,270
challenge where they were welder whether

1160
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,530
you're cyber security professional it

1161
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:29,190
doesn't matter you're gonna have a hard

1162
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:31,680
time getting getting anyone to work my

1163
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:34,230
favorite antidote was I applied for an

1164
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,990
auditing firm job it's like with my

1165
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,370
because I don't care if you know and I

1166
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,870
think it's hilarious because it's like I

1167
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,040
went through all their interviews all

1168
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,470
the technical interviews went through

1169
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,170
everything it's like boom it was all

1170
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:48,990
good and golden and then it came down

1171
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:51,720
because I didn't have a bachelor's

1172
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:54,060
degree because I had zero College it's

1173
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,279
like a no desire to get any they

1174
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:59,009
wouldn't hire me it's like and then the

1175
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,170
funny story is is like then about seven

1176
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,510
years later I go take their my extreme

1177
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,130
hacking class in New York and during

1178
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,780
that I found a vulnerability one of

1179
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,250
their my sequel servers that they had

1180
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,600
internet-facing that they were part of

1181
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,910
the class and they didn't realize was

1182
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,100
actually internet-facing and that I was

1183
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,390
like oops sorry it's like you know it's

1184
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,380
like she though having me on your team

1185
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:21,720
first but uh but yeah so it's like I

1186
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,370
that stuff is shouldn't be the thing is

1187
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,790
I guess it's based on what the person

1188
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:28,200
can know and what they can learn not

1189
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:30,240
what all this other experience that they

1190
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,359
can actually get with your company

1191
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,520
because I mean who dd1 a guy who who

1192
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,350
start your job that it's like no this is

1193
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,700
the way I've always done it it's like or

1194
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,200
when do you like to have someone that

1195
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,270
you can go and you can train like this

1196
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,129
is the way we want it done this is the

1197
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:46,200
way we think it's efficient this is what

1198
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,120
our programs run and that way you can

1199
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,890
actually build that up instead of trying

1200
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,359
to have to tear down what they've

1201
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,620
learned before so they can learn the

1202
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,620
processes that you're familiar with

1203
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:59,690
thank you there's another question

1204
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:56,700
you know one of the challenges on that

1205
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:58,289
just in general has been that we have

1206
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,989
independent school districts right so

1207
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:02,549
what you'll find is you if you can

1208
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:04,440
figure out how to get something

1209
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:07,170
implemented in one school district you

1210
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:11,400
almost have to start over again in it in

1211
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:13,410
another school district but we've we've

1212
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,569
got a lot of programs that through te a

1213
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:17,969
which are texas education initiation we

1214
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:20,069
can go and push down one of I think the

1215
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:22,380
clever ways we can do things like that

1216
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:25,680
is by changing what's called teks which

1217
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,089
is our curriculum right if we can and

1218
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,459
I'm happy to work with you on that I

1219
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:30,930
mean if we can start I mean our

1220
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:32,788
curriculum if you look at it some of it

1221
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:35,848
is so dated it's not even funny right I

1222
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:38,519
mean it's it's like I mean it's kind of

1223
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:39,599
embarrassing parts of it and when shows

1224
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:43,258
up in the news is really embarrassing

1225
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,029
but if there's the way to change that at

1226
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:47,009
the fastest level is to start working

1227
00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:51,420
with te a and with your state rep if

1228
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:52,949
you're in El Paso then through teks and

1229
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,229
through the State Board of Education is

1230
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:56,699
the way to do that and I'll say when we

1231
00:51:55,229 --> 00:51:59,308
said how do we how do we go and get

1232
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:01,890
stuff done sometimes cybersecurity is a

1233
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:04,199
way to say to get it done but today

1234
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:06,058
especially in El Paso unfortunately if

1235
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:08,729
you put it in the in the realm of this

1236
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,769
is about safety this is about whether

1237
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:14,308
school safety or to prevent mass

1238
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:16,799
violence or to stop anti domestic

1239
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:20,699
terrorism and put it in that I think

1240
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:24,059
you'll find doors will open quick what I

1241
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:26,160
like to interject over to also it's like

1242
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,690
as the DEF CON group go one basket or

1243
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,420
it's like I've worked with deaf

1244
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:32,760
groups all over and trying to get them

1245
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:35,190
more involved with actually going into

1246
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,810
schools it's like and but not by

1247
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:38,430
themselves because that's really weird

1248
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,690
having a hacker guy in a hoodie come up

1249
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,480
to your school said hey I'd like to talk

1250
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:44,069
to your kids about some online safety

1251
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,200
but no getting involved with law

1252
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:48,569
enforcement it's like reaching out to

1253
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,549
the local law enforcement first showing

1254
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:51,839
them what you do to showing them what

1255
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:54,560
you're about showing them what your

1256
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,210
groups are about and then using the FBI

1257
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,339
whatever it's like they have online

1258
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,920
material for kids safety it's like they

1259
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:05,130
have the training material but don't get

1260
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,270
some cop or FBI agent to go to the

1261
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,310
school and actually talk to them because

1262
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,410
Lord that's a mess it's like that's like

1263
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,750
Dare days right it's like that's really

1264
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:15,690
gonna keep people from doing drugs I

1265
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:17,400
actually get the hacker it's like to go

1266
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,530
and talk so first of all you ruin the

1267
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,480
whole negative connotation that people

1268
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,790
are got the bias where it's like hackers

1269
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,480
or the bad guys it's like hackers are

1270
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,940
not bad guys

1271
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,500
it's like criminals or bad guys it's

1272
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,060
like so it's like and so you have a

1273
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,319
hacker talking to them in a way that

1274
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,690
they understand they can relate to

1275
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:35,460
because we know all the cool memes too

1276
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,230
and it's like and actually can

1277
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,599
communicate to them in those issues and

1278
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:42,119
it's like and so that gives it in a

1279
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,220
novel way but you also have the backing

1280
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,230
of law enforcement it's like to deal

1281
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,000
with the school and it's like and they

1282
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,920
can help that which person is going to

1283
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,710
be out there in front talking to the

1284
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,280
person which hacker that they want to do

1285
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,280
that yes

1286
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,799
[Music]
