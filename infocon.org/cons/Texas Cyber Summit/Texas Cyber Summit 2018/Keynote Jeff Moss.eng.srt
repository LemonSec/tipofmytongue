1
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:10,629
really Joseph on the first year here in

2
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:12,129
the death the hell so far off the rocks

3
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:17,080
and to a good start

4
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:18,610
so that's possible I never I always

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,430
encourage people to start conferences

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:25,058
because I think one of the the best

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,790
strengths besides sharing information is

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:31,599
building community and how they talked a

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:33,969
bit today about community but you'll see

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,860
that underneath on with all the problems

11
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,579
they see it's pretty much people

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,460
problems

13
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,350
I mean people build technology so I

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,990
guess everything's a people problem but

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,900
you'll see that where I think we're

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,900
heading the community is a country

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,570
people and I'm hoping there will be some

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,329
people in this room because I can tell

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,920
you there's a big shortage of included

20
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:08,950
people participating in the process so

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,450
the more people can get involved the

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,219
better and so let me just tell you my

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:23,380
expectancy for today's talk this is my

24
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:25,089
talk by the way sorry conversation tell

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,068
you where I'm coming from some of the

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,909
big thoughts that I've had and then I'm

27
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:32,719
hoping toward the end you can push

28
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,490
and tell me what your thoughts are on it

29
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,710
and where you think I might be wrong

30
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,199
because I think you know there is no

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,990
answer so I come from for a long time I

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,009
come from the Hector community and I

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,560
live in the effect and there's a

34
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,720
difference and I've been trying to call

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,049
out the difference recently I think I

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,970
think happy and acting conferences are

37
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,569
more interested in like sort of the joy

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,298
of discovery but I did totally trashed

39
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:09,890
your machine and I think in folks life

40
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,470
is much more focused on producing skills

41
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:16,010
advancing careers producing tangible

42
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,200
results that help a company or you

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,120
financially and they're not necessarily

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,738
the same thing but if you pretend

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,069
they're the same thing you'll go a

46
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,819
little crazy I I look a little crazy and

47
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:33,869
my solution conference I have a full

48
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:36,600
second conference black and so I would

49
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,019
just suggest to you at some point make

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,630
time for your record so and keep that

51
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:45,239
family separated from your info so so

52
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,959
and you'll find you'll get strength and

53
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,829
inspiration for maybe the exercise

54
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,269
because I can tell you you're never

55
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,600
gonna convince your boss the learning to

56
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,299
happy of scores final fear company's

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,470
engine but it might be mildly you know

58
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,600
so fulfilling

59
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:07,200
so the other thing I think you have to

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,290
be really definitely breaks failure all

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,290
right

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:26,120
we go failure it turns out that this

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:30,080
failure as unique to our industry

64
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,100
and it's pretty unique to Western

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,040
civilization

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,000
so Valley in particular if you ever in

67
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,890
say China or Asia culturally admitting

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,310
failure is a very self-limiting maneuver

69
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,720
in the West so compactly you'll say man

70
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,459
I just had to start up it and fail

71
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,930
everybody else will buy you a drink

72
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,970
they'll say great what did you learn I

73
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,400
tell me about your mistakes so I don't

74
00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:03,650
have to make doesn't happen to very many

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:09,500
other industries so it breaks that don't

76
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:14,150
fire them necessarily government

77
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:21,339
involved it's no longer our playpen it's

78
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:25,820
no longer ours it is a phenomena and

79
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:28,700
governments have their say frankly and

80
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,950
so because of this we're seeing more and

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,530
more sort of policy encroachments into

82
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,870
what we would consider our domains you

83
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,809
can push back or you can embrace it and

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,760
personally I have been embracing it

85
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,180
because I think you can't help affect

86
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,510
change you're not involved and so my

87
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,979
personal trajectory that have been

88
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,130
unfortunately less spectable but

89
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:56,780
fortunately I get some more political

90
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:59,240
more policy and I'm realizing now we're

91
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,950
right at the beginning of it right

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,030
meaning in the last couple of years or

93
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,070
five years it's going to be another

94
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,700
that kiddies until they even have some

95
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,110
of this stuff figured out so don't feel

96
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,490
like you're late to the party

97
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,420
all right we're still setting up those

98
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,800
tools bringing in the case so you can

99
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,360
actually have a really large material

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,310
impact and because the there's a lot of

101
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,420
who here wants to admit that here with

102
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,900
military or people how many do you think

103
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:35,620
those people in line it's more than four

104
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,380
here I'm I've been told there's more

105
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,919
than four here so I'll try to convince

106
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,020
some of my thoughts more maybe in a US

107
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:50,020
and a military perspective the national

108
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:52,210
security perspective but you can see

109
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,270
where it's the researchers were really

110
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,680
were effective about two years ago three

111
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,229
years ago how many people follow the

112
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,630
Wassenaar arrangement sort of debates

113
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:08,010
arms control so this was an area where

114
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:11,260
some decisions have been made and

115
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,820
researchers never trying to didn't even

116
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,280
know we need to chime in and completely

117
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,040
give to us the Wassenaar arrangement

118
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,549
procedures and next thing you know some

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,110
researchers in the red team II offensive

120
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,220
security side looked at it and heard

121
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,979
about it said wait a minute

122
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,729
this means my business is illegal now or

123
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:31,870
it could be illegal right

124
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,330
actually notes finders

125
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,590
reverse engineers started writing

126
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,359
articles about it next thing you know

127
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,710
semantics

128
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,740
and Microsoft and Apple China said oh if

129
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,080
I have a foreigner sitting next to a US

130
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,050
citizen and one has some information

131
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,300
they can't tell my foreign engineer

132
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,610
about that information does that mean

133
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,860
considered that doesn't make sense so

134
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,729
all of a sudden we've got corporate

135
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,889
America and researchers involved in the

136
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,719
Wassenaar arrangement in policy and

137
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,340
since then we've had some really

138
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,139
positive interactions I think that was

139
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,969
our watershed moment that's woken us all

140
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,180
up that says number one you don't have

141
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:15,180
to be a policy ninja to make impact you

142
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,650
just have to be aware and then when the

143
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,840
Department of Commerce did it called for

144
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,060
feedback from the community on how these

145
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,770
rules the effective it was the most

146
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,550
amount of feedback the Department

147
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,139
Congress that haven't had any issue ever

148
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,539
so exciting that we're not shy that's

149
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:36,900
well pointy enough problems and other

150
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:39,150
people's policies so when I'm thinking

151
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,710
about where this is taking us and when

152
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,388
I'm thinking about what the future hold

153
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:48,719
I think it's really going to be the

154
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:53,909
United States and China this is not the

155
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:57,000
most some people don't like that and I

156
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:58,620
don't like that necessarily but I don't

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,330
see any other possible future let me

158
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:06,360
explain that a little unpacked a little

159
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:10,068
bit who's signing internet standards who

160
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,779
is sending people to IETF meetings who

161
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,820
has a giant economy that produces

162
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,420
technology like

163
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,010
there's a tiny amount of Russian router

164
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Brazilian cell phones you know a

165
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:26,180
Canadian PlayStation right it doesn't

166
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,990
happen almost all the products he finds

167
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:34,340
a silver made in I know we're designed

168
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:38,919
in a manner and do you see that changing

169
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:43,070
it into the next point here I don't

170
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:46,370
okay so so two products we buy and the

171
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,500
standards that are set are coming mostly

172
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,540
in China

173
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,460
what well your community there's huge

174
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:57,050
okay your communion

175
00:08:52,460 --> 00:09:00,620
I'll give them a close third but with

176
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,479
the GE PR and some other policies

177
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,740
they're exploring like this trying to

178
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,800
filter knighted for intellectual

179
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,560
property protection they're claiming to

180
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,170
fall on their length their hampering

181
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,449
themselves and I think that's gonna make

182
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:20,870
their economy and short hours in front

183
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:23,240
less competitive which means they're

184
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,480
gonna be taking a big figuring out what

185
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,480
they're up to

186
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:32,420
so so I'll keep looking over my shoulder

187
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,770
is you European Union is doing you know

188
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,290
maybe they'll help set some standards

189
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,380
and we can import for our own privacy

190
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:44,530
protections for various reasons animal I

191
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,939
don't see America stopping like games

192
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:54,189
and I'll explain for a couple reasons

193
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:57,550
one is what in the future I think data

194
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,550
Rd is key

195
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:06,110
big data it is the battleground in which

196
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,290
were fighting who has the data it's

197
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,920
Canada and the data brands have the data

198
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,459
for this Google Amazon Facebook

199
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:20,599
Microsoft right it's Huawei 10-7 I do

200
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,770
have the data so if you need the data to

201
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,770
run you gentle machine learning

202
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,260
algorithms we've been trained your

203
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,090
systems

204
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,040
I think they naturally happen

205
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,210
competitive I don't think Russia

206
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,670
naturally have some competitive

207
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,160
advantage in this area or many other

208
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,449
countries and then when people bring up

209
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,750
Russia it's like they're antastic

210
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,020
spoiler I think it in a trench any party

211
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:48,230
I think it took over any birthday cake

212
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,960
they can you know make things a mess but

213
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:55,460
obviously I'll be buying anything from

214
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,440
them today you can count really in the

215
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,660
Internet or are they just there

216
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,100
eventually exploited things for us and I

217
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,350
don't get things their way and so I keep

218
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,180
my eye on the thing that fundamentally

219
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:19,010
is going to move the needle from our

220
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:22,670
countries do you just can't get around

221
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,960
and therefore any solution to an

222
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:31,069
Internet problems gonna have to have a

223
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:32,900
global solution that means because

224
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,460
they're making all this stuff so he can

225
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,640
get China to make their own team

226
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,860
products

227
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,829
all that means the entire planet has

228
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,990
that much more secure IOT products and

229
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:48,399
so it's to our advantage to push them to

230
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,570
produce better products so I think

231
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,420
that's why there's a certain

232
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,920
international component to this and the

233
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,880
only people who can really apply

234
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:03,310
international pressure are Chinese

235
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:06,100
companies and difference and if you

236
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:09,010
think what China has been saying lately

237
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,420
it seems like we're also paying for

238
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,880
showdown

239
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,560
a contest between models we've got

240
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,480
America the American Western democratic

241
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,079
system with its values and then a new

242
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:28,140
emerging Chinese and the Chinese are

243
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:31,269
really feeling compliment right now

244
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:35,339
government over there it basically goes

245
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:39,279
like hey we've had some great successes

246
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:42,070
we have very depending the economy big

247
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,930
countries that were involved with we

248
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,519
don't seem to be suffering from all the

249
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,500
internal stripes that you're suffering

250
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,980
over there in the West we don't have

251
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:54,670
these problems with fake news we think

252
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,500
we have a winning model so it will be

253
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,000
almost impossible for you to convince us

254
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,709
that we need to switch to your model

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,829
because we currently think about models

256
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:09,160
well that's the mindset to try out here

257
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:10,329
you're jujitsu monomethyl jujitsu but

258
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,019
they didn't really think that they've

259
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:16,779
got a winner so what does that matter

260
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:19,320
involved well they've got you know they

261
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:23,470
do deals unilaterally and multilaterally

262
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,130
just like the United States but unlike

263
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,130
United States

264
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,970
I really I mean there won't be a meeting

265
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,190
like this we're sitting around talking

266
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,960
about how we're going to lobby the

267
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,640
government how we're going to get

268
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,700
involved in the Oise my arrangement

269
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,800
I doesn't happen there so they don't

270
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,830
have that feedback mechanism of the

271
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:52,380
civil society or the multi-stakeholder

272
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:55,030
model though that's alien in that arena

273
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,420
but it gives them a certain strength

274
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:01,060
right they have single voice they have

275
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,709
long-term vision they can pick a target

276
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,449
they can pick an objective and they can

277
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:08,320
pursue for a very long time is that the

278
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:12,790
inside track we're in the Western moment

279
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,670
we get sidetracked and it slows us down

280
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,319
I would say though the strength of

281
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,910
having all these extra voices in the

282
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,070
room is it gives us legitimacy our model

283
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,709
government actually represents all the

284
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,870
people and so what our government does

285
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,510
speak it's legitimately speaking for the

286
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,710
vast majority of the people and so I

287
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:39,700
think that's how you do strength

288
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:41,160
it's just takes forever to get there we

289
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,040
will talk about our marketplace of ideas

290
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,930
and it seems like the Despoiler who are

291
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,480
aggressive they can optimize their

292
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,260
attacks to come after

293
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,650
is deep faves I think you're gonna be

294
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,150
just I'm like I'm attracted I'm up all

295
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,650
the same time you know it's like look

296
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,910
into the car wreck on the side of the

297
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,370
road they call me I got somebody got

298
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,689
hurt but I got a look it's the same

299
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,580
thing happening with this whole deep

300
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,560
fake technology it's like oh my gosh

301
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,080
they look so real you know when you see

302
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,459
the videos of Obama and I don't know Kid

303
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,350
Rock or something and they're making the

304
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,270
same movements and they're sounding the

305
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,220
same and then you hear what they can do

306
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,350
with 15 seconds of your age they could

307
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,720
make you say anything and then you see

308
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,530
the advancements on automated

309
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,300
robocalling

310
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,100
and they can interact with you like an

311
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,219
IVR system and you can have a

312
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,560
conversation with a robot that sounds

313
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,340
like anybody and you can extrapolate

314
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:38,130
this is known about and it's just very

315
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,140
well you will be able to trust video you

316
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:47,400
will be able to trust you you won't be

317
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:52,620
able to trust almost any kind of but how

318
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:54,300
do you get how do we get past this and

319
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,000
it looks like they're adversaries you

320
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,170
know they fix the problem they zoom

321
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,350
right in on us and you can see the

322
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:11,189
argument between information security

323
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:11,520
and sort of data security Russia and

324
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,490
China

325
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,050
control the information flows very

326
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,120
strictly and trying to prevent these

327
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,180
problems anybody speaking out against us

328
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,310
we can't let anything go and that's

329
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,979
being tested right now that we tested us

330
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,020
and we the people designing the systems

331
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,160
to detect it will mean the people trying

332
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,680
to create the countries

333
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,400
we the people that experts trying to say

334
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,310
tell them what do we do giving you the

335
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,420
heads up it's coming down the road it's

336
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,479
going to lead all kinds of your

337
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,160
cognitive visited the Russians have some

338
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,770
tractor this morning's like an info shop

339
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,230
they call it you know they try to create

340
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,360
a post truth or a fake news environment

341
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,710
and then I believe it's gonna lead us in

342
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,960
this industry to have a certain amount

343
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,810
of cognitive dissonance where we believe

344
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:05,189
what we believe but not sure why right

345
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:07,020
or we end up distrusting too much okay

346
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:12,120
that's kind of like that was maybe a

347
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:14,790
little too much on German systems but it

348
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,030
leads me to this next point which is the

349
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,709
people who the offense the people in in

350
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:24,030
government and read claims the people

351
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:26,579
who know how to attack professional day

352
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:34,350
after day information operations and

353
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:42,870
those who know different University how

354
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:44,939
far the to give you some examples during

355
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,050
the Cold War before and there's a

356
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,120
build-up for the missile gap and

357
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,159
countries were trying to figure out how

358
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,959
did you into their weapons eventually

359
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,150
after about 40 or 50 years ended up with

360
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,070
the mutually assured destruction model

361
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,930
we didn't get in there overnight that

362
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,030
wasn't like five years or ten years it

363
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,440
took a long time and the people involved

364
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,649
in that debate that helped create that

365
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:12,870
nor were academics beginning think tanks

366
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:15,090
policymakers researchers it was the sort

367
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,129
of civil society response to how are we

368
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,658
going to deal with this

369
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:22,509
people in the department of war or

370
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:25,419
Department of Defense but we have today

371
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:27,039
though as we have super super

372
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:29,080
specialized people doing super

373
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,320
specialized offense in super-classified

374
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,110
environments that never talked about

375
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,629
none of that ever gets out and then you

376
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,850
have people on the hill and people

377
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:42,668
newspapers policy makers and people

378
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,649
ranking movies that just sort of invent

379
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:47,230
in their mind how offense must be

380
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:48,518
occurring and then that informs the

381
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,739
public and then that informs our

382
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,049
representatives and nexon you know how

383
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:56,340
often really happens and how a real

384
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:58,629
thinks it happens they're diverging and

385
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,850
this really crystallized for me when I

386
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:03,279
was in a I was at a conference about

387
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,070
those at NATO saikhan conference in

388
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,649
Estonia and there was an academic up on

389
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:12,970
stage he was telling us all about

390
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:16,149
offense in cyber and it hurt this can

391
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,720
hang it was next to me that does this

392
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,719
for living

393
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,100
it's like right we're gonna have our

394
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,360
policymakers everybody off off to the

395
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,379
races thinking that they're designing

396
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,750
policies within reality effects is a

397
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:41,000
completely different there's a big

398
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,860
disconnect there and that's not so bad

399
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,260
for our adversaries there's a big

400
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,719
disconnect in our policymakers take more

401
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,410
power to the bank in it but it is a

402
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,930
problem for our governance model when we

403
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:56,840
know how informative population rather

404
00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:00,170
than foreign policy in this great little

405
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,629
society all speakers everybody and so I

406
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,370
see going forward is how are we going to

407
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,050
be able to sort of bridge that gap a

408
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,030
little bit more without giving away the

409
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,100
secret sauce without compromising

410
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:15,310
operations it's almost like we need to

411
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,310
educate people on it's not a

412
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:23,690
quarter-pounder people working big

413
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:26,390
effects for years that's not how people

414
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,810
think it's tough this is disconnect is

415
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:35,330
only gonna get worse

416
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:36,830
the other thing is we have a great

417
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,120
saying ones and I'll paraphrase it

418
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,600
because I'm not sure if I remember it

419
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,820
correctly but essentially it is there

420
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,100
are those who operate at scale and then

421
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,389
there's everybody knows are you either

422
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,439
operate at scale or you don't

423
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,300
and that is a big second just like those

424
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,700
are those who understand in my own

425
00:20:53,300 --> 00:21:03,110
there's no you you're consuming big data

426
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:06,100
and operated scale for you so what is

427
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:12,449
that well let's see my original point

428
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:16,330
comes an operating escape Apple Google

429
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:22,570
said I do who's not operating at Skate

430
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:27,100
Canada France Germany I mean really it's

431
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,659
a weird bipolar world where there the

432
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,510
internet was supposed to connect us all

433
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,300
and empower us all and if you believe

434
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,070
the trends what's happening we're

435
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,159
creating these attracted what I call

436
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,620
attractive nuisances the economies of

437
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:46,750
scale are forcing us to centralize and

438
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:49,479
as we centralized we're creating like if

439
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,400
you had a blog in the olden days if

440
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:56,680
every 900 significant walking platform

441
00:21:51,400 --> 00:22:00,670
your the blog today right market forces

442
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,710
are consolidating so what does that mean

443
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,560
you've never been well if the government

444
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,480
had to regulate one of 200 logs not to

445
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,659
be difficult but if the government has

446
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,370
to regulate Facebook that's a really

447
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,280
convenient and when you talk to

448
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,979
politicians in the European Union they

449
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,940
love it because now they can go after

450
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,710
YouTube Google or Facebook they're not

451
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,380
going after 500 American companies

452
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,580
they're going after to write an American

453
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,940
regulators want to regulate something

454
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,470
thank you after four or five right it's

455
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,250
really convenient and if you look at the

456
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,750
future the future of big data this means

457
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,800
this consolidation will probably

458
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:44,190
continue so while there might be five

459
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,669
billion connected devices on the planet

460
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,670
there's gonna be

461
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,030
what's the implication of that those

462
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,669
companies are gonna be hugely

463
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,010
consequential in our life they're gonna

464
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,480
be targeted regulation if I was a

465
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,950
military I was trying to take down some

466
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,240
B's infrastructure I don't have to bomb

467
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:09,610
500 blog sites digitally father but I

468
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,740
have to go after - well I have to do

469
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,050
bigger research in compromise - sites

470
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:23,620
it's much easier than trying to give 500

471
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:24,940
insiders and 500 locations so there's a

472
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,560
lot of consequences as well it was

473
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,990
interesting I was talking to the chief

474
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,210
knowledge officer at IBM and he had this

475
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,790
great being IBM you have a slide that in

476
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,460
this great slide deck and then pointed

477
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:39,280
to the riot and amount of data that's

478
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,770
being stored and the speed of bandwidth

479
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,280
over the clinic in the Pacific this

480
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:47,379
point was that it's so expensive to move

481
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,110
the data to where you're computing you

482
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,570
have to compute where the data is at you

483
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,429
know you can't move that much data over

484
00:23:52,570 --> 00:24:04,379
a little straw and then compute on it

485
00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:07,560
here you get it so that means that's not

486
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,750
geological you know module located

487
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,070
anchor they can't move and then

488
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,360
everybody's gonna cluster a rabbit

489
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:18,250
trying to get at it with high-speed

490
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:21,389
computing so that means geography is

491
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,390
really important again

492
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,270
in these bottles and we're those welds

493
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,209
that located are going to be really

494
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,310
important and so I'd like say Singapore

495
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,350
that have rule of law and great

496
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,480
connectivity that can become very

497
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,370
important in the global order addictive

498
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,160
is you're not going to stick your data

499
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:44,949
center in Malaysia Singapore right move

500
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:51,550
up roll up what do you pick up you're

501
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:52,960
out there you're a big so the other

502
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,250
consequences of this is that

503
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,720
everything's going to be multi tenant

504
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,370
everything is going to be shared

505
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,770
well how do you differentiate for

506
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,120
targeting if everything is you're going

507
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,980
to spend so much time trying to figure

508
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,870
out the impacts the second is there's

509
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,380
over impact of taking down one server

510
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:14,379
here an attacker because everything is

511
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:15,670
going to have a consequence and I always

512
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:22,900
wonder what would I think it's announced

513
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:24,250
that say CIA is by Amazon I always

514
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,760
wonder is that just like a different

515
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:30,240
graph or is that a lot of ability is a

516
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,620
bill that has a big target on the roof

517
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:39,730
because I wouldn't want legitimate

518
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:41,639
target mixed in if I commercial probably

519
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,260
I separate that if you can and so with

520
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,130
that name is sort of like designated

521
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,680
servers

522
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,260
that's it native data centers and you

523
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,870
can see it's tonyia being so small after

524
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,120
the attack Estonia had Russia

525
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,659
there their foreign ministry has done to

526
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,959
ignition

527
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,310
they have sovereign servers that that

528
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,710
particular metacommunity sovereign

529
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:05,230
servers posted outside of Estonia and

530
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,080
they have a complete backup of the whole

531
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:11,470
country's infrastructure and citizens

532
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,419
data outside of Estonia ready to reboot

533
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:21,220
in case the country is wiped out by a

534
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:24,030
biome or something I summon server

535
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,030
administrator

536
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,928
that just sounds cool how probably means

537
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,130
you're gonna have to be really careful

538
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:33,130
if you're targeting these things

539
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,650
another thing that finding fascinating

540
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:46,290
is that machine learning seems favored

541
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,900
attack seems to favor of offense right

542
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,879
then so that's five to ten years if I'm

543
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,410
writing the net battle system I can

544
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,750
either can try to build something to

545
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,720
save the world like say the cyber grand

546
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,070
challenge did or I don't have the

547
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,330
resources I'm just trying to be a better

548
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:06,110
editor about secret attack and why is

549
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:09,659
that it's the cycle the loops are pastor

550
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:12,090
did I get in there did I not get pretty

551
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,830
easy to tell fun writing a defense

552
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:21,929
system it's like well did I recall an

553
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:23,340
attack or not how legitimate network

554
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,730
traffic and they try to find out what's

555
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:31,169
not legitimate good luck with that I've

556
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,370
been doing that for 20 30 years but tell

557
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,750
them whether you probably shuttle or not

558
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:39,929
you can probably internet that be easily

559
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:44,010
and so the offensive cycle will

560
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:47,660
accelerate it is accelerating I've

561
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:51,030
talked to somebody who understand

562
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:54,870
research but he said there's databases

563
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:59,120
available for a small fee where bad guys

564
00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:01,620
have met sort of it's like the entire

565
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,199
they know every version of everything

566
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,629
that's running and for small fee you can

567
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,620
create a database so for example if I

568
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:12,390
add a new jhula exploit I could go there

569
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,189
and I can put in the jeweler version and

570
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,400
it'll give me the IP addresses of every

571
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:21,050
machine in the world can import that

572
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,050
database and I can hit go and I can hit

573
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,250
information

574
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,620
and collective defense and call up your

575
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,400
money of the sir it's like one minute

576
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,419
you're safe

577
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:42,940
thanks make it up right and so if you

578
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:46,510
look at the rule right it's kind of so

579
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:51,370
tight that basically the decisions are

580
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:53,770
not that it's our do I attack or not and

581
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,570
once you decide to attack what you know

582
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,800
the target is vulnerable or highly

583
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:01,450
confident that they're vulnerable

584
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:03,790
because almost then not so on defense

585
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:08,650
and so we end up with this disparity

586
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:12,700
where attack is it it's predominantly a

587
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:16,240
technical exercise defense is highly

588
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,200
political well what do we protect what's

589
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,790
worth protecting

590
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,690
how much money would be better protected

591
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:26,920
well Wadena County pay for will Susan in

592
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:29,410
hor improving right it turns into big

593
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,690
person problem we have to get together

594
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:36,100
and decide how to protect America policy

595
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,670
where the legal requirements so has its

596
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,350
duty and it's very technical defense

597
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:43,990
very very political you have to talk to

598
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:46,629
third-party vendors your helpers

599
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,070
providers it's very slow and then

600
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,180
leadership if you don't have good

601
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,590
leadership leadership is going to

602
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,330
provide the direction they're gonna

603
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,590
provide the priorities here's what's

604
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,770
worth protecting here's what's worth

605
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,480
noting when did you give the snacks and

606
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,280
we have to be aware of this can we

607
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,660
operate you are gonna operate across all

608
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,480
three boundaries you might be an attack

609
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,340
attacking our company

610
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,660
example but you have to be aware of how

611
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,370
defense works and what the political

612
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,799
reality is because otherwise you can't

613
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,860
provide any about any but and your

614
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,240
employers going to be like yes we know

615
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,530
we're both will be needed and will

616
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,640
provide and of course they do ship it

617
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,649
someone's going to call you up and say

618
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,000
like what just happened what does this

619
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:31,070
mean my daughter's there and defensive

620
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,480
sort of like out marketing how many

621
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,860
people have been unfortunate or

622
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,760
fortunate enough to work in a marketing

623
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:40,010
organization right like the saying is I

624
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,260
don't have to my budget is wasted I just

625
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:45,890
don't know which happened it's the same

626
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:52,340
in defense because it's an offense is

627
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:54,230
now such a secret arcane art the vendors

628
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:57,199
don't have a lot of really good

629
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,690
monitoring models to work out but that's

630
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,559
they stopped working in offenders just

631
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,549
keep inventing new new features new

632
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,860
defenses that they are may have a

633
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:09,679
contagion to do impacts the defense and

634
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,750
all are compact the Eldar who networks

635
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,200
at google project zero and so one of

636
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,820
those jobs is he travels around a cool

637
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,760
art medicine and helps them become

638
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,409
better defenders and he always tells me

639
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,610
stories about these defenders who were

640
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,080
so proud to show off the latest

641
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,280
destruction but how they're going to

642
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,280
prevent any future except

643
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:35,899
well can you go back in time and point

644
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:40,309
the three bugs if this would have

645
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:44,059
stopped like okay you've added four

646
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:46,490
hundred lines of code and so what's

647
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:48,649
happening is absence this knowledge of

648
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,330
how real offense works the defenders are

649
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:52,100
making our systems more complicated

650
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,980
they're doing it with a tinkerer right

651
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,689
but they might not be doing what's best

652
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,760
in a long time and you have to be aware

653
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,429
of that the two are somewhat

654
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:14,899
disconnected so I have two big advocate

655
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:18,639
of training how many machines have not

656
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:28,580
teaching anybody they don't already know

657
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:31,070
and so when I talk about we're not

658
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,899
trying to steal money the Rings have

659
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:37,299
printing presses they make their own

660
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:39,320
money so they're generally after secrets

661
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:41,929
organized criminals don't have pretty

662
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,700
impressive probably not so interested

663
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:44,990
that maybe fungible things that they

664
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,559
could monetize quickly their effort

665
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,090
money and if you look at the difference

666
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,940
between those two right they both need

667
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,010
the internet to work to steal secrets or

668
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:58,460
steal money all the players need the

669
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:00,650
Internet to function and hackers

670
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,180
academic security researchers meeting

671
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,880
generally we want to know how things

672
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,470
work you want to tear things apart to

673
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,970
get it to quote unquote the truth the

674
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:14,840
ground truth how does a technology

675
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:18,740
really work and companies by criminals

676
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,939
I don't wanna make money but the

677
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,460
criminals I'm going to tell you how

678
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,350
they're breaking they tell you how

679
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,730
they're breaking in company is not going

680
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,740
to tell you the problems security

681
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,310
problems in their products who does that

682
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,820
leave

683
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:33,470
it's us it's hackers and the security

684
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,540
researchers we are one of the only

685
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:40,520
sources of ground truth knowledge coming

686
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:42,649
out if you look at cars locks smart

687
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,980
vehicles voting machines implantable

688
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,990
medical devices whatever it it's coming

689
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,190
from our community because there's sort

690
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,780
of a market filling the other

691
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,590
communities are not providing that

692
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:57,440
information so that puts us in a really

693
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:10,429
weird position we knew the only person

694
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:11,810
in the room talking about because we

695
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:14,779
don't quite realize that the whole world

696
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,920
listening to what we say because there's

697
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,450
other people

698
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,210
like these things it's not in their

699
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:22,339
interests and when I go through these

700
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,100
groups I always wondered is there a

701
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,140
group I'm missing and I've gotten that

702
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,610
before but I'm wondering these four

703
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,710
groups all need the internet to function

704
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,890
is there a fifth group out there that

705
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,150
definitely the Internet to function like

706
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,889
it wouldn't be the end of their business

707
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,680
models over that stopped working

708
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,020
and I haven't even really been able to

709
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,020
come up with a model but I just know the

710
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,840
Internet is insecure rickety as it is

711
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,969
now when all the players need to work I

712
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,380
just imagine if there's a group out

713
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:54,919
there they didn't necessarily mean the

714
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:59,450
amount to work and they just okay then

715
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:07,730
we're in trouble and now I'm into real

716
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:09,319
come so in this world that is getting a

717
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,660
little bit more fragile it's not quite

718
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,210
informed by information operations and

719
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,160
depends we have the internet architects

720
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,810
we have internet engineer we have the

721
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,000
people building to maintaining the core

722
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,320
of the Internet and they're doing

723
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,510
whatever they can do they're sticking

724
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:29,990
don't we take one things are wrapping

725
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:32,140
them with bacon wire in Louisville we're

726
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:36,140
making the whole entire more friendly

727
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:39,290
we're making the whole internet whole

728
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:42,440
thing in the name of security greater

729
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:44,770
flexibility for the name of security you

730
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,280
can see this happening across

731
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:51,950
so when I started with the Internet

732
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,700
you could sort of travel around the

733
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,200
whole world

734
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,609
and people would source route funny

735
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,379
messages to themselves up by driving

736
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:59,270
through a city in Australia Oh what

737
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,450
would a rat look through Africa right

738
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:04,130
they could send use an ICP redirects and

739
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,020
then get a packet and they just keep

740
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,580
redirected Chinese are public oh cool

741
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:12,530
that took 30 seconds for Toronto the

742
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:16,279
world to the minute 1/2 do we allow ICMP

743
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:18,290
redirects anymore we've outsourced loser

744
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,680
streaks or anymore not really

745
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:23,960
we have EVP filters everywhere all right

746
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,319
so BGP Friday is having to get locked

747
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,810
down because people keep misusing we

748
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,150
have DNS SEC now where if you screw up

749
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:33,830
one little certificate you don't have

750
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,050
made a circus anymore nobody can find

751
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,910
your company but we have to do that

752
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:41,060
because people are lying about DNS

753
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:43,759
responses we're moving to a future of

754
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:47,509
security TV you screw up one certificate

755
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,740
now you don't read but we're having to

756
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:54,580
give this because of our environment all

757
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:58,819
right we want to go to SMTP TLS always

758
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,859
HSTs always all right bye everything

759
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,570
about running a web server mail servers

760
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:04,340
just hideously complicated now you make

761
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,990
one mistake I always talk somebody you

762
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,290
can probably cause more chaos as a bad

763
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,750
guy

764
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,430
by getting into somebody's DNS server

765
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,880
and just updating some HS

766
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,359
yes records are H keep paying

767
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,500
certificates to non-existent

768
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:17,180
certificates

769
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,309
everything would stop nobody could get

770
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,529
to your site I knew have the famous clue

771
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:26,109
what just went wrong because everything

772
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:30,020
is don't running that's our future

773
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:32,869
wonder if that's the future that we want

774
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,910
I know it's all my intention I know the

775
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:36,770
engineers are doing their best but then

776
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,558
some of the doesn't this become a policy

777
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:42,559
decision like we decide we're gonna

778
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:44,750
trade off for this much security and get

779
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,000
this much flexibility or resilience you

780
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,349
know at some point we're gonna be okay

781
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,420
with everything that's all addicted in

782
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:54,680
five data centers but in return we get

783
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,660
you know three movies we aren't having

784
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,660
these discussions partially because

785
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:06,109
people aren't informed with them

786
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:07,788
that's a problem so I'm questioning like

787
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:08,960
in the future who makes these policies

788
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:11,000
will end up in China who's gonna make

789
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,529
the policy for the government because

790
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,170
there's nobody else to be involved in

791
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:16,730
our system are we going to be involved

792
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,250
in making this are we gonna have to join

793
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:23,109
the idea for the item eat are we going

794
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,109
to do

795
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:34,840
there's a big world out there where huge

796
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:36,070
tectonic shifts are happening and if

797
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,420
you're not involved there you're not

798
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,640
aware you're just gonna wake up one day

799
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,230
and it's you know big data's gonna be

800
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:46,839
done to you it's the new being involved

801
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:48,760
and so the debate surrounding norms are

802
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,180
happening right now

803
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,880
they started years ago - the norms to be

804
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,759
what are the acceptable norms of

805
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,290
behavior nationally internationally and

806
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,760
you might not realize that's begin part

807
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:04,680
even part of this debate new Marty

808
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,880
concepts or norms things that

809
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,080
coordinated only really did this closure

810
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,740
is a good thing

811
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,890
I see me be participating in that that

812
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,209
it used to be the norm

813
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:19,120
it used to be responsible disclosure

814
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:21,280
which was a terrible idea it was great

815
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,529
for companies is they could decide who

816
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,630
is responsible about but it wasn't so

817
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:30,790
good for anybody else and we managed to

818
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:32,410
get past that - thanks to someone in the

819
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,180
trip we have all these inequities

820
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,569
program that is now becoming the

821
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,560
department a lot of countries right

822
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,620
governments are now expected to behave

823
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,630
in a certain way and then they know we

824
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,759
use these norms just wanting to identify

825
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,520
the spot okay this is about actor who's

826
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,570
not who's been in a little bit strangely

827
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,950
with tensions it gives us a way of sort

828
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:58,090
of figuring out who's outside who's not

829
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,640
you might not realize it right your

830
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:03,130
Terms of Service acceptable use policies

831
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,279
in the routing world we have period

832
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,910
agreements and if you're pissed off

833
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,029
enough of your peers you

834
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:13,519
here you don't get to rap anymore that

835
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:16,880
didn't involve law enforcement in a

836
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,680
politician that was a community response

837
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,420
to deciding that you're no good or

838
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,038
withdrawing our routes there's no legal

839
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:37,700
requirement that they have to provide I

840
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:39,619
mean to you and so we have ongoing the

841
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,140
base in these areas right the watchtower

842
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:44,210
arrangement on effects of tools you I

843
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,029
keep saying this in a random way but I

844
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,619
want you to get involved I want you to

845
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:52,130
help identify these problems I want you

846
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:54,259
to find the bad actors and I want you to

847
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:57,680
recognize that at the heart of it it's

848
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:59,299
us it's a hacker info centers community

849
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,379
and we're going to be called on to

850
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:06,140
participate more of these or policy

851
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,309
so people saying is great how do I do

852
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,759
that

853
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:12,349
and it's really easy it's as much or as

854
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:14,150
little effort as you want to put into it

855
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:19,430
so for example all the time if there's a

856
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:21,140
request for comments go to you read

857
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,899
about of the global and you say that's a

858
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,328
great idea that's a terrible is why it

859
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,980
takes five minutes or you can spend it

860
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:31,339
in ten hours doing the research back you

861
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,690
know you're staying with data and having

862
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:33,319
been the chief security officer not

863
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,230
again

864
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:38,660
I can tell you absolutely at least like

865
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,579
you've read every comment on different

866
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,680
proposals we took everything very

867
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:44,720
seriously partially because like in

868
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,629
Department of Commerce we got so few

869
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,538
comments I'm not kidding it's a planet

870
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,700
of billions of connected people and we

871
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:57,769
would get 20 comments on an important

872
00:41:52,700 --> 00:42:02,390
policy funny any one of those comments

873
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:03,950
could sway the whole decision so don't

874
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,779
think that you're one of the 50,000

875
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,460
people in common

876
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,670
anything you're not you're like one of

877
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,040
the 50 so if you're interested in an

878
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,660
area lost are you you come in at the

879
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,970
Department of Commerce but you can

880
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:19,330
provide your feedback and people

881
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:22,480
actually listen just it's mind-boggling

882
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,490
there was one guy I can know who he was

883
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,860
nobody ever taught we assumed it's a key

884
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,120
exhibit the name we don't even know what

885
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:31,450
country is it but he commented in

886
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:34,480
English commented on his proposal for

887
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:36,370
the last ten years there was never a

888
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,400
proposal was one person never come in a

889
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:41,200
tie and never can go we need that we

890
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,810
never met this person in real life but

891
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,790
it was really weird because you be

892
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:47,560
reviewing feedback and people would

893
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:51,100
inevitably say well what did that guy

894
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,290
say it's he's so involved and so too

895
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,670
hidden both sort of like counted more

896
00:42:53,290 --> 00:43:00,570
than other people's because he was so

897
00:42:54,670 --> 00:43:03,430
involved in the process he cared so I

898
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,230
call it story just to say to you I could

899
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:14,620
be any one of you you don't have to get

900
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:16,120
on an airplane and fly to the mic I'm

901
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,960
wondering if any one of those points

902
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,630
ever get spent

903
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,120
instead Cochise free money pool the

904
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,710
whole thing collapses and I'm wondering

905
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,450
if it's to the point like how close is

906
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:28,820
it that we can pre-compute a single coin

907
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,589
she's cool and if somebody could do that

908
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,910
that person has the power to wreck the

909
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:34,190
whole Bitcoin all they have to do is buy

910
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:37,430
that one point they can trash a little

911
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:46,820
party for everybody they just say that I

912
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:49,250
try not to okay so that's generally my

913
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:51,349
big picture which is that the we're in

914
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,880
this era where we're technology is

915
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:55,550
critically important you can see that

916
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,160
with AML big data but at the same time

917
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,710
the equal side of it is becoming I would

918
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,839
say more important what you also see

919
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,510
finally is company if you're in the

920
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:07,609
military or the government and

921
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,560
somebody's messing with you who do you

922
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:12,319
call you have a State Department you

923
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,029
have a military if you're a company and

924
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,520
somebody's messing with you who do you

925
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:19,099
call not the State Department not the

926
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:22,790
military intelligence agency do you call

927
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:24,920
your lawyers right my lawyers are like

928
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:26,810
my Intelligence Agency my diplomatic

929
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,220
military they're everything all of

930
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:33,529
that's my my lawyers so lawyers like the

931
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,930
middle well I just like to find things

932
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:38,540
to do to be useful so you see more and

933
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:40,279
more lawyers involved in this area and

934
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:44,750
they're going to do nothing to get more

935
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,800
involved so when we lawyers ask me where

936
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,619
do you think you should I should get

937
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,079
involved with what's the future I think

938
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,460
it should be suing people should sue as

939
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,710
many people as you can but you should

940
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,930
sue them in other countries because

941
00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:00,190
what's happening is we're really good at

942
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,190
each other within America

943
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:07,349
country they just keep spamming like you

944
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,490
know soon that other country like well

945
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:10,349
that's up at work there's no

946
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,259
jurisdiction ago so that doesn't matter

947
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:15,660
just start swinging and create

948
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,910
presidents create force lawyers none of

949
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,560
the country top five team forest judges

950
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,680
on that other country to make decisions

951
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,119
out lab right that will start the

952
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,770
dialogue you're not going to solve the

953
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,329
problem but you're gonna start a backlog

954
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,009
where you're forcing other people to act

955
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:58,619
and one of the first companies that

956
00:45:29,010 --> 00:46:02,190
would do this so the guys up there

957
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:05,520
giving us the burger saying haha three

958
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:08,760
years later a new treaty with Canada the

959
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,349
judgment applies right so you never know

960
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,010
what the future will hold

961
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:15,569
so I guess other people right lawyers

962
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,819
are gonna get involved if I was a lawyer

963
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:19,470
man I would be because we need is we

964
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,970
need norms we don't need just

965
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:24,480
governments talking to governments

966
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:26,879
figuring this out that's interesting but

967
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,910
who owns and operates the internet civil

968
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,220
society so civil society would have to

969
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,328
figure out our solutions and they'll be

970
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,700
in the framework the legal framework

971
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:37,290
provided by a government but I'm telling

972
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,750
ya military's not going to come in and

973
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,509
say

974
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,190
the different labs I recommend say I see

975
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,720
if I come in and say here we worked at a

976
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:46,990
company right it's on you and your

977
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,569
lawyers do now so I have like maybe five

978
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,669
or six minutes I'd love to talk to you

979
00:46:49,570 --> 00:47:03,520
because honestly I find the question

980
00:46:51,670 --> 00:47:06,000
more interesting hopefully 10 Tim

981
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,390
berners-lee is terrible proposal about

982
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,090
DRM or is proposal about the ubiquitous

983
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:14,920
everybody run by the server at home yeah

984
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,620
yeah isn't that essentially everybody

985
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,530
want to pack to your home and then post

986
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:22,180
other people's key porn by accident and

987
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:26,500
now we're pretty viable for deals of

988
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:29,440
data that was a glib answer but I'm all

989
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:35,160
distributed systems but I'm kind of more

990
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,160
of the crypto privacy anarchist like

991
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:40,480
what was his name

992
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,700
left or not I do he what's in the

993
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,440
distributed data store freedoms right

994
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,509
more of a free net solution where

995
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,720
everything is encrypted you don't know

996
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:53,980
what you're posting I almost feel like

997
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,339
that's tins Mel Koopa for for allowing

998
00:47:53,980 --> 00:48:04,250
DRM into the

999
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:06,770
and which tells that are forgiven for so

1000
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,780
follow on that I think though the part

1001
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,100
of that distributed systems that's the

1002
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,570
only way around would be a

1003
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,310
centralization right this trend of

1004
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:14,840
centralization we're seeing that we

1005
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,040
don't like that the future our only

1006
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:20,480
other future is distribution

1007
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:23,509
distribution systems and so I donate my

1008
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,980
age people who are developing this is

1009
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,510
done these things like that will give us

1010
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,980
an alternative because right now there's

1011
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,750
only one thing on the menu of its I

1012
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,640
don't like where that's going

1013
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,360
and it's chicken every day I want

1014
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,359
another option

1015
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,730
No yeah you don't need to be policy

1016
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,710
affects this none at all but you need to

1017
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,500
be aware that policy is happening and it

1018
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:56,119
can happen to you just like the security

1019
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,160
researchers woke up one day and lost our

1020
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:00,380
bathroom to them a year before they

1021
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,609
didn't even realize that they lost the

1022
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:06,290
race they didn't even know there was one

1023
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:08,960
right right so in that arena I think

1024
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:12,079
that the happy byproduct of wasps are is

1025
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,720
that everybody's more tuned to it so now

1026
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,910
there's a policy mailing lists there's

1027
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,649
websites there's a lot of the security

1028
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:20,808
blocks cover this stuff that we're dark

1029
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,180
birth wasn't covered so I think it

1030
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:26,089
awareness they're raising awareness

1031
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:27,558
there's a there's a community problem

1032
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:30,140
it's still on my phone it's good with

1033
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:32,150
like every other Thursday a bunch of the

1034
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:34,250
companies from Watchtower Microsoft and

1035
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,410
so on they all have together pool their

1036
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:39,440
money hired a law firm in DC that law

1037
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:43,308
firm is sort of directing the

1038
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,200
community's responses in DC and they

1039
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:47,390
have an open phone call every other week

1040
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,250
to update anybody who cares to call on

1041
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,828
the call participate review their

1042
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,660
documents whatever and so it is reading

1043
00:49:51,829 --> 00:50:00,170
that case kind of created this mechanism

1044
00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:02,980
for everybody to provide feedback five

1045
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,980
minutes five minutes

1046
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,150
[Music]

1047
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,470
right

1048
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,610
right right we're in this great period

1049
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,510
we're having to submit a button legally

1050
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,460
legitimately

1051
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,870
that there's no and there's all these

1052
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,180
other problems too like some of the

1053
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:27,130
bounty programs Hector what requires a

1054
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,299
real name but what if I don't want to

1055
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,730
give you my real name I don't want to

1056
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,410
get paid so I give you a lady I just

1057
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,730
want you to know about the button some

1058
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,899
of these bounty programs don't have that

1059
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,570
option because they assume everybody

1060
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,940
wants to get paid so we're working on

1061
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,830
waiting through these systems where you

1062
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,420
know probably not a problem five ten

1063
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:47,200
years from now but it's a real problem

1064
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:50,080
right now so anything you could do just

1065
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,450
be that so for example like I was about

1066
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,130
a year ago security is not txt you know

1067
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:57,910
that on your website in the well-known

1068
00:50:54,130 --> 00:51:00,190
folder the problem was how do I even

1069
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:01,930
know who to contact on that comes up

1070
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:03,400
with a standard Google put a file called

1071
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:06,220
security dot txt in the well-known

1072
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:10,210
directory and hit oldest could contact

1073
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:16,540
how to PT PT so on and so forth that was

1074
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:18,310
one person it's now accepted so there's

1075
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:22,170
ways to you know there's ways to try to

1076
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:24,549
screw these bumps over and I'm always

1077
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:26,680
you can always google school this dump

1078
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:30,090
it on full disclosure might not be the

1079
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:38,080
most responsible thing to do but you

1080
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:39,640
think answer I think there's a problem

1081
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,319
now than the theater and it's so hyper

1082
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,359
connected you might think that the

1083
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,250
problem is insignificant the manufacture

1084
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,440
might think the problem

1085
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,760
but there might be a wallpaper using

1086
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,060
that technology in a different way we're

1087
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,790
turns out no it's a punctual it's just

1088
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,410
other people disagree but unless you get

1089
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,779
information either let people make their

1090
00:51:55,410 --> 00:52:00,868
own decisions like I don't want to make

1091
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:03,450
it so he decided for me what I like in

1092
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:06,920
the research and I can look at the whole

1093
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,919
for me that's really important

1094
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:26,490
I call it the vodka I think the term is

1095
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,170
confusing that means different things to

1096
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:32,160
different people so you can't really

1097
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:34,410
agree to what net neutrality and I I

1098
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,629
think that traffic Rd rounded there's

1099
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:38,368
already quality of service depending

1100
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:41,700
upon what route to pay for what you're

1101
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:42,990
pairing arrangements are you get traffic

1102
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,180
is not neutral rated to weighted

1103
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:47,580
immensely and when a system is under

1104
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,440
attack the administrators absolutely

1105
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,700
provide filtering and different levels

1106
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,790
of priority based on what's being

1107
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:57,450
attacked so with the net neutrality laws

1108
00:52:53,790 --> 00:53:05,580
that I can never filter under attack and

1109
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:07,770
I can't filter so it's highly nuanced

1110
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:11,180
and I don't hear anything they want to

1111
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:16,130
the debate so I avoid those debates

1112
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:18,140
until hopefully go throw up a little bit

1113
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,370
okay

1114
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:23,210
that is it I'll be around for a while

1115
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:23,210
I'll see you outside

1116
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:30,349
[Applause]

1117
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:37,049
you
