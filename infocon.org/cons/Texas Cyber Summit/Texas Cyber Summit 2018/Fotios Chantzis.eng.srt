1
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:19,619
okay one two okay all right so I'll be

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,549
talking about common vulnerabilities in

3
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:28,980
medical devices my name is Forrest on

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:32,570
this I work at the Mayo Clinic and what

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,610
we've been doing there is basically

6
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:39,710
variability assessments on medical

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,129
devices some of my past work has been

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:47,610
focusing on network security research

9
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:51,209
and some of the highlights you can sit

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,930
there I've been very involved with the

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,879
enema project written the N crack

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,350
authentication cracking to among other

13
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,970
things the mastering and map video

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:10,500
course and a website there with all my

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,869
work and recently because of my work at

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,450
the Mayo Clinic I've been focusing a lot

17
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,520
on i-80 and medical device security so

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:27,810
what we've been doing lately

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,770
amongst other things was DEFCON 26 by

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,250
hiding billets

21
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:40,079
with which we collaborated we've been we

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:43,079
have organized mainly capture the flag

23
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,619
contest where we emulated the ball

24
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:51,240
number medical device where it was

25
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,520
comprised of two separate components the

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,009
Raspberry Pi that emulated an infusion

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,750
pump and was vulnerable to a buffer

28
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,210
overflow and an insecure communication

29
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,869
channel with a server component and the

30
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,959
server component was vulnerable to a

31
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,710
sequel injection certainly a system bug

32
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,200
and there was also a fax server

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,610
speaking the DICOM protocol we're gonna

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,429
talk about this later in the

35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:28,550
presentation and here's an example of

36
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:36,720
the simple pickle sterilization bug

37
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:40,650
which was exploitable and the challenge

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,060
is there were to find the park server

39
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,490
application entity title name to

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:51,510
demonstrate how we could extract patient

41
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,450
data using some DICOM standard requests

42
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:58,739
and eventually how we could extract

43
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:03,060
daikon images that are associated with a

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:05,400
specific patient and also the other

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,230
vulnerabilities of the server such as

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,290
the pickle vulnerability and the sequel

47
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:15,239
injection together verse shell so we I

48
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:24,540
wanted to mention this as a segue for

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:29,280
the importance of the of the healthcare

50
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:32,310
industry statistics on how much it has

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,120
been attacked in the past few years so

52
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,760
these are some of the numbers you can

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,200
you can you can see out there we've

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,570
we've been seeing a lot of obviously

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,480
increases in the attacks in the attacks

56
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,019
in in the healthcare industry

57
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,030
but most of all the the main problem is

58
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,150
that the medical devices that you see in

59
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,940
the healthcare industry are quite

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:06,270
insecure and this is what we'll be

61
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:09,570
talking about one major example that was

62
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:13,920
the wanna cry ransom ware outbreak in

63
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:17,579
the UK specifically at the NHS we saw 65

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:22,440
hospitals being taken down by the

65
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:25,890
malware in one day and I don't know if

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,060
you recognize that medical center on the

67
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,750
bottom right

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:36,210
corner it's the Presbyterian Medical

69
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:40,080
Center in Los Angeles and recently they

70
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,450
were also hit by ransomware it basically

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,650
exploited a Java this realization a bug

72
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:51,990
in one device and it was taken down for

73
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,810
for some days the the main problem there

74
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,360
was that surgeries and other

75
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,460
appointments had to be rescheduled so

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,890
the the basic problem there is that

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:09,870
patients have been harmed directly or

78
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:12,740
indirectly through that and you know

79
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:17,250
doctors don't necessarily have to count

80
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,200
bodies like deaths because of cyber

81
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,020
attacks on the healthcare industry it

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,719
can be indirect harm for example if

83
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,090
someone has a stroke and because the CT

84
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,220
scanner isn't working because it has

85
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:34,020
been taken down by a ransomware attack

86
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,600
then the loss of time because of that

87
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,820
incident good results in the patient not

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:44,130
being able to do work so we have to take

89
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,880
into account that patient harm isn't

90
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,729
always direct it can be indirect the

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,900
other targets is of course the protected

92
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:57,030
health information or the personal

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:04,200
identifiable information the main

94
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:06,090
targets of cyber criminals there is it

95
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,520
is important because of the fact that it

96
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,640
has a longer shelf life so if you seen

97
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,450
in the black market for example credit

98
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,659
cards are one tenth of the value of the

99
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:22,620
8sy because of the fact that they can be

100
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,229
used in ten years and they will

101
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,240
basically be the same they they have a

102
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:33,479
longer shelf life they have a much

103
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:36,510
higher value and recently I was I was

104
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,659
reading an article by David all of

105
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,590
immunity and he was saying that why

106
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,790
would a nation

107
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:47,940
State attack a hospital why why would it

108
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,580
be important for them to steal thi and

109
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,610
that the main reason is that if you have

110
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,650
thi you have medical records of patients

111
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,790
especially if they are high-profile

112
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:03,469
patients you basically have a database

113
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:06,090
of ground truth because medical records

114
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,330
you know diseases that the person might

115
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:13,260
have or do not change a lot throughout

116
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,659
ones lifetime they they are unlike

117
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,450
credit cards or other you know

118
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,230
personally identifiable information they

119
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:26,070
they are there to stay the other a

120
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:28,320
target is medical research IP especially

121
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,800
for a big organization like the Mayo

122
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,710
Clinic there is a lot of it is also an

123
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,710
educational institute as you may know so

124
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,750
there is a lot of research done by you

125
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:47,239
know postdocs and doctors and a lot of

126
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:51,270
researchers and this is very commonly a

127
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:56,160
target for theft the other reason is

128
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:58,140
disruption generally when you do a cyber

129
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,370
attack in the healthcare industry you

130
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:07,169
invoke fear it's like the on any kind of

131
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:10,550
critical infrastructure like ICS III

132
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:14,730
remember it's I was impressed by what

133
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:18,300
Robert Lee said in his you know today

134
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:22,680
about the biggest fear is the fear so

135
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:27,090
that when you do such an attack and you

136
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:30,090
you you show the the populace that you

137
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:34,319
can you can do that then you invoke a

138
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,659
lot of fear and then that entails that

139
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,530
you have a lot of influence over various

140
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:43,230
issues and the final targets the final

141
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,110
reason would be directly profits again

142
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:50,670
if you if you so bhi on the black market

143
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:53,570
then you know cyber criminals can get a

144
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,569
lot of money out of that

145
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,620
so as I am the cavalry he said in a

146
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,860
recent presentation with great

147
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,570
connectivity comes great responsibility

148
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:10,480
until recently medical devices weren't

149
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:13,570
connected to the network they weren't

150
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,940
made with the intent to be connected to

151
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:21,880
the network so that means that they

152
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:24,480
weren't designed to be secure and at the

153
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,439
clinical information security we

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,210
basically after all these these attacks

155
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,490
and everything that is happening out

156
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:42,700
there or in the healthcare industry we

157
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:47,260
look like that so some of main medical

158
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:51,190
device security problems one of the one

159
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:56,230
of the main problems is that you need to

160
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,810
have 24/7 functionality of systems you

161
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,230
can't just say conduct a penetration

162
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,930
test on the network because you can't

163
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,620
just take down some of these systems you

164
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:12,130
have to test them separately on a test

165
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,480
lab ideally in the same settings as they

166
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,500
would be in the in the clinical

167
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,210
environment and then find all the

168
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,490
vulnerabilities and then fix them on the

169
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,620
production environment you can just you

170
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,470
know attack any kind of device from the

171
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:31,170
clinical Network because you might bring

172
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:34,330
some of them down and a very very

173
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,860
significant example of that is that the

174
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,210
other day we were conducting an

175
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,590
assessment on specific medical device

176
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:45,460
again and this was done in a test lab

177
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:48,520
and all we had to do was an nmap version

178
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,010
scanning against it and it basically

179
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,000
bricked the device it made it crash and

180
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:58,540
reboot just by sending an enema probe

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,210
against one of their services so you can

182
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,839
you can imagine the chaos that would

183
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,700
ensue if if you started doing randomly

184
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,470
probing systems in a

185
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,040
your network you can't just do that

186
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,200
because what many of those systems are

187
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,849
you know directly connected to patients

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,010
you can't just bring them down and the

189
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,500
other problem is that you have many

190
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,480
limitations on the on installing

191
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:31,330
additional endpoint security and on

192
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:33,580
these devices many of them are very have

193
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:37,750
gone through rigorous testing they have

194
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:42,030
to get their FDA approval and then any

195
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:44,350
any additional you know intrusive

196
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:48,850
installation of anything basically

197
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:51,430
additional on their software could could

198
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,620
mean that they would have to go again

199
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:57,819
through a theory approval they would

200
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,650
have to again do rigorous testing so one

201
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,620
example of that is that I was talking

202
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,770
with with an engineer from a vendor that

203
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,070
they make blood analyzers and he was

204
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:12,540
telling me you know we can't just you

205
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:16,270
know any any additional parts that we

206
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:21,490
perform that we install on the system

207
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:23,829
means that we have to do almost three

208
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,270
months of additional testing because we

209
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,050
want to make sure that you know the

210
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:32,199
value that says if you have high fat IDs

211
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,890
or any other disease isn't affected by

212
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,620
that fat so that means that you can't

213
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,400
just in many of those devices you can't

214
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,900
just install anything you like and

215
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:48,310
directly correlated with that is that

216
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,090
antivirus systems or any kind of

217
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:56,109
anti-malware software are usually very

218
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:58,390
intrusive so you in many of these

219
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,120
devices you can't install any of that so

220
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:04,660
you have you know basic endpoint

221
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:09,970
security let alone other more other

222
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:13,560
additional software and and there are

223
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:16,900
clinical workflow issues so you can't

224
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,390
expect a surgeon any kind of doctor do

225
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,540
you have to type a complicated password

226
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,699
or password

227
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,339
whenever they have to perform surgery

228
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:29,980
you have to find a you know a golden

229
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:32,780
ratio between the clinical workflow and

230
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,950
insecurity so many of the times we have

231
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:41,209
to invent workarounds that can work and

232
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:44,540
don't limit the clinical workflow behind

233
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:48,080
the perimeter of firewall mentality that

234
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,839
that has been something that we have

235
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,540
tackled with in the past few years all

236
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,430
the vendors what they say is that okay

237
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,829
you're going to install that device in

238
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,739
you know behind the perimeter firewall

239
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:03,020
so why should you care about any kind of

240
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:09,470
vulnerabilities with soap of course a

241
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:11,150
very flawed as a as an idea because it

242
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,060
is very easy to breach the healthcare

243
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,819
network and after you are in many of the

244
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,380
times you have a flood Network so you

245
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,580
can people from one device to another

246
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,860
you can't just assume that because a

247
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,080
device is behind a firewall that it is

248
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,360
protected and then you can ignore any

249
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:35,960
kinds of abilities that they may might

250
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:38,810
have lack of software development life

251
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,900
cycle they until recently vendors

252
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:44,959
haven't many of them haven't really

253
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,120
integrated security when they are

254
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,450
designing the medical devices again

255
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,210
because medical devices by the time they

256
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:56,720
reach the markets they might need three

257
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:59,720
or seven years of development and they

258
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,170
have already outdated software already

259
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,480
outdated operating systems and the

260
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,300
devices that you see now in the market

261
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,850
they obviously were designed a long time

262
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:21,050
ago when security wasn't that much of an

263
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:22,880
issue but it is now and let's start with

264
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,709
the common types of winner abilities

265
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,230
that we have identified this is a very

266
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,290
high level overview we're gonna go into

267
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,690
more details one of the most common

268
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,010
vulnerabilities that we see our

269
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,140
hard-coded credentials

270
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,490
usually they are put there by the vendor

271
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,050
for backdoor access or their engineers

272
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,720
to be able to remotely control the

273
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,030
device but again this is one of the

274
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,370
worst ideas possible because they're

275
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,920
hard-coded credentials can be changed

276
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,530
easily by the HDO by the healthcare

277
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,770
delivery annotation or whoever else buys

278
00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:00,140
the device and they are hard-coded with

279
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,449
them in the binaries and don't somebody

280
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,550
else like an attacker finds them then

281
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,340
it's game over because you can't change

282
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,140
them unless you you know you mess with a

283
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,810
binary or you know mess with that

284
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:15,850
functionality of the device default

285
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,589
passwords we've seen so many cases of

286
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,560
you know common cases like the admin

287
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,540
admin but even worse we've seen systems

288
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,069
that have been configured with username

289
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:32,839
a password a I'm not joking like things

290
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:34,970
like that so you have to or passwords

291
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,970
that you can find in the manual and and

292
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,360
there is no process for them to be to be

293
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,000
changed

294
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,200
quick custom or no encryption in secure

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,630
communication channels like lack of TLS

296
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,530
custom encryption schemes that are not

297
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:54,439
encryption they are basically you know

298
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,800
transposition of characters or encoding

299
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,990
basically and we've been very adamant in

300
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,240
educating the vendors that this isn't

301
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:05,349
whenever you try to do your own

302
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,180
cryptography you basically fail because

303
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,389
no one is smarter than a bunch of

304
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,250
mathematicians that do that for you know

305
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,400
for their entire lifetime and have

306
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,720
developed such standards so this you

307
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,020
know vendors should be using the

308
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,650
standards instead of inventing their own

309
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:27,290
encryption schemes unsupported operating

310
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:31,250
systems Windows XP devices are still out

311
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:34,610
there Windows 7 is now going to be

312
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:40,280
outdated then Microsoft is not going to

313
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:42,679
keep producing patches for them so in

314
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,960
these cases again because of the lag

315
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,030
between when the device was developed

316
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,490
and when it reaches reach the market

317
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:53,070
you can see lots of devices that still

318
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:56,400
run outdated so software and operating

319
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,500
systems in patches but this is a big

320
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,570
issue because again you can't just

321
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,080
install anything on the medical device

322
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:07,230
without sometimes impacting FDA approval

323
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,159
or messing with with the functionality

324
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,180
of the device

325
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,640
sometimes the patches have to be

326
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,310
approved by the vendor first you can

327
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,010
just install unless sometimes in several

328
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,990
components you can have more flexibility

329
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,550
but in the devices themselves they

330
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,830
usually have to go through them first

331
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:30,990
they have with it they have to be tested

332
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:34,860
and then they are applied as a patch in

333
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,650
secure configurations again one of the

334
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,229
one of the most common things in server

335
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,410
components like file permissions or

336
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,780
other or you know excessive privileges

337
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,430
of their services running these are all

338
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,710
things that we see when we assess

339
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,130
devices and of course when there is a

340
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:56,010
web application component they usually

341
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:59,720
have all the common types of web being

342
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:05,730
abilities that you can see there like

343
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:10,100
success and all that stuff and at Mayo

344
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:14,390
we have six baseline requirements that

345
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:17,159
signify where we draw the line so all

346
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:20,730
devices have to at least meet this

347
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,760
criteria these requirements for them to

348
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,430
be brought in to the Mayo Clinic network

349
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,760
of course we ask much more than that but

350
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:32,970
if they don't have any of these or if

351
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,879
they they they don't have all these at

352
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,560
the same time then they have to be you

353
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,930
know escalated to a security community

354
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,659
to accept the risk because at the end of

355
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:46,200
the day it's all about also what the

356
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,300
doctors say if if the clinical practice

357
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,130
requires a specific device to be on

358
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,990
their network then you have to devise

359
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:55,800
workarounds because you can't just say

360
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:59,130
I'll vet of this and you're not gonna

361
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:02,499
buy the device ever because it might be

362
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,480
important in what the device does

363
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:06,759
even though it might be insecure so in

364
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,639
those cases you have to come with other

365
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:13,809
types of remediations such as isolating

366
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:15,998
the device or you know or working with a

367
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:20,230
vendor hunting hunter to find a common

368
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,330
solution so these six requirements the

369
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,559
first one complies with the device

370
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,139
should comply with work account

371
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,178
standards which means that it shouldn't

372
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:32,289
have things such as default passwords or

373
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:35,799
administrator accounts that have no use

374
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:38,619
there and they have to also be able to

375
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,379
integrate with that with the networks

376
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:44,470
Active Directory it should run and

377
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:48,610
support us which means that Windows XP

378
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:51,639
devices and Windows 7 devices in some

379
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:54,129
time in the near future will have a

380
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:56,879
violation of that requirement receives

381
00:20:54,129 --> 00:21:00,129
our routine on OS patches

382
00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:03,580
self-explanatory has some sort of AV or

383
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:07,059
you know if not a be directly some type

384
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:10,360
of white listing or a right filter which

385
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:16,299
is at least provide some some basic

386
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,649
security and hard coded passwords as we

387
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:19,929
said one of the most common winner

388
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:22,739
abilities and also for the third-party

389
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:25,629
software because you have a lot of other

390
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,740
dependencies on the software of medical

391
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:34,658
devices should also receive software

392
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:38,740
packages so now what types of systems do

393
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:42,789
we assess park servers infusion pumps CT

394
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,889
scanners implantable pacemakers pagers

395
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:46,690
we even conduct assessments on

396
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:51,758
infrastructure such as surveillance

397
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:54,190
cameras it's our systems robots that

398
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,909
perform surgery all kinds of stuff so

399
00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:01,600
our process is that every time the the

400
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:03,730
Mayo Clinic wants to buy a new device it

401
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,189
has to go through the clinical

402
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:09,369
information security team and if we deem

403
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:13,269
it important if the devices has a

404
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:15,429
significant is of significance then we

405
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:18,480
also perform a full-fledged

406
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,430
the assessment which means a hands-on

407
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,800
holistic gray box test against the

408
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,890
device where we bring it to our lab or

409
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,990
test lab for up about three weeks and we

410
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,060
inspect everything the software that the

411
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,370
hardware how the components interact

412
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,070
with each other and then we write a

413
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,379
report we send it to the vendor and we

414
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:43,179
work hand in hand with them to fix the

415
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:50,220
findings and find some remediation for

416
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:53,290
them and one one very central piece of

417
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,910
software residing in healthcare networks

418
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:59,050
is the park server so this is usually

419
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:02,230
something that you see everywhere in

420
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:06,370
clinical environments it is a software

421
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:09,520
that has a database of all the images

422
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,639
associated with patient studies it

423
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,580
usually has a service that speaks DICOM

424
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,360
and the daikon model you can see in the

425
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,429
right corner and diagram is a very

426
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,490
complicated protocol so that means it

427
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:29,320
has a lot of issues it is both a file

428
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:31,770
enter network protocol and there are

429
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,450
clients the parks clients that may be

430
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:39,040
operated by the doctor or a nurse and

431
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:42,190
they sent DICOM queries to the park

432
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,760
server and then receive an answer which

433
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:51,510
might have patient data inside the

434
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:55,270
request inside the reply so one of the

435
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:59,340
one of the most common the first step in

436
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:02,830
when you do DICOM query is to send an a

437
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,840
associate request and one of the two of

438
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,580
the most important parts of that request

439
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,399
this is from a Wireshark

440
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,860
damn is the application entity title of

441
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,910
the the cold which means the server

442
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:19,979
component and in the calling a title

443
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:27,220
which is your name the clients name so

444
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:29,200
what happens there is that in the DICOM

445
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,889
a associate request is very easy

446
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,289
we brute forcible so the only thing you

447
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,090
have to do the the client title doesn't

448
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:38,980
matter at all you can put whatever you

449
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,559
want there you can put test you can put

450
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,580
test one two three it doesn't matter but

451
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:47,559
they called a title you can just start

452
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,570
brute-forcing it's you're gonna see an

453
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,480
example later in the in the slides I

454
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,309
recently developed a module for n crack

455
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,940
that does exactly that so it tries to

456
00:24:54,309 --> 00:25:01,928
send a associate request and goes

457
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,750
through a dictionary and what it does is

458
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:07,960
it tries to find a valid called

459
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,990
ei e title there so once you get that

460
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,510
you have you have found the first part

461
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:17,620
of the equation and the second part of

462
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:21,908
the equation is the DICOM see find

463
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,789
request and what this basically does is

464
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:27,820
that after you have associated yourself

465
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:30,129
with as a client to the park server with

466
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,668
the associate request you send a see

467
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,769
find request with some query parameters

468
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:39,850
such as the patient names or you can

469
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:42,610
just put the world a world mask there

470
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,480
like the asterisk and basically what

471
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:49,299
this does is that you start querying for

472
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:55,029
patient information so they reply to

473
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:59,168
that seek find request will be pH I so

474
00:25:55,029 --> 00:26:02,200
you can sit there this is obviously test

475
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:04,929
data but this would have actual patient

476
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,500
names physician names we associated

477
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:10,840
studies with that and all of this are

478
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,730
our privates you know medical records

479
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,850
and all I needed for that was first to

480
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,980
do the associate request by knowing the

481
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:27,539
application entity title of the server

482
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:29,980
and the other part I need to know was

483
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:33,580
and you're gonna see that in the next

484
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:38,470
few slides I also needed to find for the

485
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:41,439
CE finds the server a sorry the client a

486
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:46,660
title so let me

487
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:49,120
so an example of that so first of all by

488
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:53,560
doing simple simple thing such as

489
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:57,639
running any crack against a die Compaq

490
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,770
server you first find a title of the of

491
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,510
the server by using the associate

492
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,600
request and that is independent of the

493
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,940
see find request and you find that for

494
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:14,290
example it is called or thunk or think

495
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:17,860
is a common spock server then by say a

496
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:22,270
simple Python script by using the pilots

497
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:24,580
DICOM library you know the associate

498
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,790
requests so you can see there that NBA

499
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,010
title I have or thunk which is the name

500
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,879
that I have already found and then what

501
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:35,740
you need to do from their own is to find

502
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,150
the other part of the equation which is

503
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:44,520
the AE title of the client because if

504
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:47,140
you know both then you basically can

505
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,180
kind of move ahead with a see find

506
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:55,330
request and get the patient made

507
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:59,050
metadata and then the last part of the

508
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:01,210
park server is the C move insist or the

509
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:05,230
C move again if you if you already know

510
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,880
that to a titles which are really easy

511
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,710
to find because they are brute forcible

512
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:15,550
then you send a similar request and you

513
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,640
start you start being able to download

514
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:28,350
images and this is the last part of the

515
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:28,350
of the attack again this is a valid

516
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:35,040
diagram of a valid C movement sister

517
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:38,920
request but you can you can assume that

518
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:42,490
the the one on the on the top left is an

519
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:45,070
attacker so they would they would issue

520
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:48,400
a similar request and then the sister

521
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,889
might be a different component or a

522
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,410
different IP address or it could be the

523
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,780
same IP address of the attacker and

524
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,270
again I didn't

525
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,910
anything else other than the to

526
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,129
application entity titles to perform

527
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:05,640
that attack

528
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:09,450
so overall the park security issues are

529
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:13,620
that some Park Service not all of them

530
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:17,070
only check the remote modality a84 see

531
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:20,429
find and see move so additionally they

532
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:23,159
might also be checking the IP or

533
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:25,310
hostname but for example the or thumb

534
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,780
which is a very popular open-source

535
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:32,310
implementation of a PAC server does not

536
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:35,160
so only two things and the two steps

537
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,860
that you need to do that is find a

538
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,140
target date a and the allowed modality

539
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,169
which means the client application

540
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,000
entity title with a simple script such

541
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,580
as the brute force script that I showed

542
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,230
you not more than 20 lines of Python

543
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:55,980
code and if again if even the server

544
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:58,530
performs some additional checks such as

545
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:03,710
the host name or the IP address you can

546
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:06,330
of course also fool the server by

547
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,660
hard-coding your your IP address or

548
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:12,090
hostname or you can just perform man in

549
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,090
the middle attack which in flood

550
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,340
networks in healthcare networks by using

551
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:21,000
things of the say are pikas poisoning

552
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,530
you can pretty much do many times and

553
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,730
the other problem is that daikon is

554
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:30,720
unencrypted 99% of the times we haven't

555
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:33,390
actually seen any time to be encrypted

556
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,560
because the problem is that even if a

557
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:40,490
vendor supports DICOM encryption the

558
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,379
park servers that are used out there

559
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,820
should support encryption as well for

560
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,450
this to work and they usually don't

561
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:52,560
because again security in these kinds of

562
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:54,960
systems is here behind so until we see

563
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,760
that everyone agrees that the next step

564
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,740
is that we should be using the DICOM

565
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,510
encryption you're gonna see everything

566
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:05,700
unencrypted and patient data ph psy

567
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,870
flowing through the healthcare network

568
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,870
completely in clear-text

569
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:18,629
and then I want to move in some some

570
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:21,629
scenarios of attacks by going through

571
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:25,379
some vulnerabilities that we have seen

572
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:29,039
in practice being exploited and we have

573
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:32,009
also assessed many of them in the

574
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,320
medical systems so an example scenario

575
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:36,360
of an attack scene as we call them is

576
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,059
that you know an attacker would first

577
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,820
gain access to the Internet by basically

578
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:43,590
most of the times it's fishing then they

579
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,230
would install and maintain a backdoor

580
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:48,209
access to the victim system and they

581
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,850
would be put to a medical device server

582
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,919
by exploiting some some web application

583
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,959
before password elevate their privileges

584
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,230
and then gain access to the medical

585
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,850
device by exploiting trust and Trust is

586
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:06,809
another serious component of of medical

587
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:09,269
devices of medical device issues because

588
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,499
when it there is a server component many

589
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,679
of the times there is no mutual

590
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:15,269
authentication so you have own she

591
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,070
exploited one you can exploit the other

592
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:22,710
because of this implicit trust so an

593
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,389
example scenario of why how you how an

594
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,210
attacker would gain access to an MRI

595
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:29,570
scanner first you would need to gain

596
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,460
access to the Internet

597
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:35,789
phishing is one of the most common ways

598
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:39,809
to do that the attacker would send a

599
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:41,820
malicious email attachment Bob there

600
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:47,220
would be duped into opening the

601
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:49,080
attachment and then the attacker would

602
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,230
install some malware on the Bob's

603
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,928
machine and which would call back to the

604
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,340
attacker machine you can like which kind

605
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:59,399
of vulnerabilities would have to be

606
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:02,610
exploited there and some of the hiding

607
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:06,840
tools there you can see that you know

608
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:11,369
I've written MSF venom it doesn't have

609
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,889
to be some you know special nation-state

610
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:16,709
developed too loud there recently I was

611
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:18,658
there was a report by the five eyes

612
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,850
agencies about the common tools that

613
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,450
attackers use and if you see they are

614
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:26,070
usually

615
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:29,639
open-source tools most of the times it

616
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:37,500
doesn't have to be some you know Stuxnet

617
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:39,779
level kind of tool and after the

618
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,820
attacker has established their foothold

619
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:46,200
on the network they would have to gain

620
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:49,620
access to the web server of that manages

621
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,139
the the MRI scanner so they would be

622
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,389
able to the web server again how would

623
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:55,469
they do that because many healthcare

624
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:57,389
networks are flat

625
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,179
they don't have segmentation so they

626
00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:02,279
would take on just once they have access

627
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:08,010
to up any machine on the network they

628
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:11,250
can just access any other then how would

629
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:14,550
they gain access to the web server many

630
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,980
many ways to do that many of the web

631
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:20,490
portals actually most of them that we

632
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:25,020
have seen are brute force abou so you

633
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:28,259
can just start performing a cracking

634
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,149
attack against them or you can or you

635
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,829
can just consult the device manual

636
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:33,989
because if they have default passwords

637
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:38,159
you could find a manual on the internet

638
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:40,828
and you see that you know the username

639
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:46,349
and the password are some some easy

640
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:48,530
things and they would elevate the

641
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,899
privileges on the web server again

642
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:55,530
common vulnerabilities that we always

643
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:59,690
have in our reports excessive privileges

644
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:05,040
of the services this is usually hard to

645
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:07,470
do for the vendors to work around

646
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,290
because many of the times we know that

647
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:12,839
you know doing the fine grained

648
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,839
privilege separation might be hard in

649
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,060
terms of development but this is

650
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,180
something that you know eventually

651
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,670
should we should start seeing some some

652
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,910
better practices everything running a

653
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:30,890
system or a Zoras root is no good

654
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:33,990
practice and then they would elevate

655
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,509
their privileges using any kind of

656
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,109
vulnerable

657
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:40,300
the web server and how they gain access

658
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,910
to the MRI scanner hits the MRI scanner

659
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:47,470
is running a vulnerable

660
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:51,520
SMB version and they would they would

661
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:53,549
basically use the same kind of

662
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,400
vulnerable girls that wanna cry and

663
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:00,910
we've seen examples of that like the NHS

664
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:04,390
as I mentioned previously that had this

665
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,670
issue scenario two

666
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:12,279
how would you gain access to an infusion

667
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:14,530
pump so whenever we perform tests we

668
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,650
always assume the worst case scenario we

669
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:21,280
always assume that the adversary is a

670
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,020
nation state level threat actor they

671
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,030
have unlimited time and unlimited

672
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,620
resources so that's why one of the

673
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,270
things that we do with when we

674
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,970
collaborate with the vendors to perform

675
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,620
our assessment is we interview their

676
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:36,939
engineers and ask them for information

677
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:38,859
and credentials so that we just get done

678
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,980
with the security through obscurity kind

679
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:44,590
of thing we because we have to assume

680
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:48,070
that the attackers would eventually even

681
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:49,990
enough time find these issues and if the

682
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:53,350
vendor doesn't work with us for us to

683
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:59,529
find those issues before you know the

684
00:36:53,350 --> 00:37:04,120
bad guys then we we see no no step

685
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:06,400
forward so any threat doctor could just

686
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:10,120
purchase a medical device from eBay or

687
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,650
any other marketplace and it doesn't

688
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,810
have to be the same device it might be

689
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,790
an older version many of them you know

690
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,549
share the same hard-coded credentials or

691
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:23,170
there is a pattern they are like if the

692
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:26,650
one if they find one Hartwood credential

693
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:29,490
in say the version 2.3 then in the next

694
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:34,690
version it might be a very similar

695
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:37,209
credential then as an optional step they

696
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:40,330
could leak those credentials somewhere

697
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:43,500
out there on you know dark web forums

698
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:48,430
and they might be accessible to anyone

699
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:50,890
and after again

700
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:54,370
establishing foothold in the Internet of

701
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:57,640
a healthcare network by using the same

702
00:37:54,370 --> 00:38:00,130
type of attack as the first scenario

703
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,720
they would directly gain access to the

704
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,870
infusion pump using those same

705
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,120
hard-coded credentials as an alternative

706
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:10,600
way they could analyze the communication

707
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:15,310
between the server and the pump they

708
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:17,620
could use for example Agaricus poisoning

709
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:21,910
to do that I perform among the middle

710
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:23,650
attack and then because also the

711
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:26,740
communication is in clear text they

712
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,810
would see how the you know the protocol

713
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,759
works between the two interacting

714
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,960
components the server and the pump and

715
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:37,030
then they could masquerade as the server

716
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,010
and because there is no mutual

717
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,450
authentication again the implicit trust

718
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:47,980
between the two components they would

719
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:50,319
maliciously modify the captured session

720
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:54,400
packets and they could push a rogue drug

721
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,690
library and these are all things that we

722
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,240
have either seen or done ourselves

723
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:04,510
whenever we have tested device so this

724
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:07,930
is no sigh and scenario 3 how they would

725
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:10,540
gain access to ultrasound scanner one of

726
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,819
the first steps as a scenario they could

727
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,460
plant an exercise in a publicly

728
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:20,400
accessible healthcare portal that would

729
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:23,920
be visited by a practitioner so when

730
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,550
when they do that they would gain access

731
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:32,560
to Charlie's system there and they could

732
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:35,770
use a browser exploit when they redirect

733
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,549
charge the Machine through the XSS and

734
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:42,460
because his machine is out of date or

735
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,620
his browser is out of date they would

736
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:49,060
gain access to that then they could

737
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:52,500
hijack their active Parks web session by

738
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:58,240
using a man in the browser attack and

739
00:39:52,500 --> 00:40:01,690
once they have done that they can first

740
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,049
of all start exfiltrating data from the

741
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,220
pox

742
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:11,700
because this is again has a huge

743
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:15,250
database of images and ph i and by using

744
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:19,210
simple things such as HTTP a tunnel over

745
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:23,230
HTTP that would bypass most of the DLP

746
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:25,320
solutions and then as a final step they

747
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:31,300
would gain access to the ultrasound

748
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:34,630
system by inherently by exploiting the

749
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,790
inherently broken daikon libraries so

750
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:40,750
again because daikon is such a

751
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:44,170
complicated complex protocol it is very

752
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:46,270
easy to you know to fuzz it and then

753
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,070
find all sorts of buffer overflow

754
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:55,870
vulnerabilities that could lead to

755
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:59,500
remote code execution and another bonus

756
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:03,900
scenario is and this is this is a very

757
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:08,590
important one how would they infiltrate

758
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:10,150
the healthcare network by by using a

759
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:13,510
third-party network because many of

760
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:15,310
these systems they have to to provide

761
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,640
some kind of remote support for their

762
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:21,700
systems or devices so by accessing the

763
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,180
third-party vendor and then using that

764
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:31,330
remote support connection they just gain

765
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:33,190
a foothold on your network and so the

766
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:37,450
things that we try to do at the clinical

767
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:39,820
from a security team is we try to as I

768
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:44,290
said do a holistic vulnerability

769
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:46,810
assessment so whenever we set up the the

770
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,610
equipment in our test lab we try to set

771
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,590
it up in collaboration with a vendor in

772
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,810
the same way as they they it would be

773
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:55,870
deployed in the production environment

774
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:58,540
and we conduct web application

775
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:01,210
assessment if there is a web server

776
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:04,330
component we try to reverse-engineer any

777
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:07,570
kind of protocol that is used

778
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:09,340
we are reverse engineer any binaries try

779
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:13,660
to search for example for hard-coded

780
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:15,940
credentials or other flaws any kind of

781
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,850
cryptographic aspects again

782
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,070
for things such as weak encryption such

783
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:25,620
as the encoding which is no encryption

784
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:28,750
that we've seen many times we try to

785
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:31,509
perform as I said a gray box test so

786
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,280
sometimes we get admin credentials from

787
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,410
the vendor for some of their server

788
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,490
components so we can inspect it from the

789
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:41,770
inside out and see for example if they

790
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:45,189
have insecure file permissions or I

791
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,870
think such as any kind of privilege

792
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:51,310
escalation attacks or any kind of

793
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:53,529
outdated software hardware hiding this

794
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:57,279
is one of the most interesting aspects

795
00:42:53,530 --> 00:43:01,240
of what we do have a separate slide for

796
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,420
that later we also in the end do a

797
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,669
remote scan of winner abilities what we

798
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,820
usually do not rely on automated tools

799
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:12,160
so most of the other stuff we do is

800
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:14,620
manual inspection and of course the

801
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,859
interviewing of the vendor staff so the

802
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:23,440
hardware hiding we use all these tools

803
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:26,560
we try to inspect to extract the

804
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,160
firmware inspect the memory of any any

805
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,440
tips that we might have access to if

806
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,870
there is a radio frequency component

807
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,510
which we have seen in implantable

808
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:41,230
devices then we try to reverse-engineer

809
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,020
that and this can take a long time so in

810
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,820
those cases we might dedicate even more

811
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,280
than three weeks for a specific device

812
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,400
because it's not feasible to you know

813
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:54,520
reverse engineer an RF protocol when you

814
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,260
have no knowledge of anything and by you

815
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:03,670
know having to perform through a

816
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:06,580
transform sonda on the signal and this

817
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:09,730
is just a diagram of what we find how

818
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:12,190
the power types the assessment

819
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:17,160
methodology correlates with a common

820
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:17,160
vulnerabilities that we have identified

821
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:26,379
and some of the lessons learned medical

822
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:28,759
device occurred is hard because of all

823
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,460
these reasons basically I've mentioned

824
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,450
it's hard to implement endpoint security

825
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:38,000
it's hard to for some for some of the

826
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,589
devices to say no to the clinical

827
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,440
practice because they they need the

828
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:43,910
device for their main functionality so

829
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,849
you have to find workarounds

830
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:49,460
but the Venerable is that we see in

831
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:53,329
there are very similar to mainstream

832
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:55,690
systems for legacy devices meaning all

833
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:57,770
these devices that run outdated

834
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,540
operating systems there is no easy

835
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,530
solution sometimes you have to isolate

836
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,660
it

837
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:05,619
you know install a separate firewall a

838
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:10,759
hardware far far wall in front of it or

839
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:12,470
find any other way to do secure it so

840
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,819
that's why we conduct the holistic

841
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:19,069
vulnerability assessment on them and

842
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:22,130
some some of the things that we have

843
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:26,660
been pushing lately the industry as a

844
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:30,380
whole medical device vendors is for them

845
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,970
to start doing their own assessments by

846
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,940
either you know

847
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:37,490
hiring a third party or by having a

848
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,260
security team of their own because this

849
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:42,109
past few years we have done you know a

850
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:45,049
lot of work for them for free basically

851
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:46,609
by doing all these assessments and then

852
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:49,970
collaborating with them to you know

853
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:52,578
point out the various vulnerabilities in

854
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:57,078
the devices because we don't want the

855
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:59,089
insecure devices in our network and one

856
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:01,160
of the most important things for them is

857
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,960
to start integrating security in the

858
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,710
development lifecycle we have seen a lot

859
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:12,170
of progress lately so I think we're

860
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:14,210
getting there and also by in company

861
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:17,540
incorporating the security in the

862
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:23,920
procurement pace so right now Mayo

863
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:27,710
Clinic is asking a lot of say paperwork

864
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,109
whenever they buy a device and the

865
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:32,770
analysts of our team they perform an

866
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:36,259
assessment a high level assessment first

867
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:38,869
for the types of problems that might be

868
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:42,080
obvious without necessarily conducting a

869
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:43,670
technical assessment so for example if

870
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,440
there is no network connectivity of the

871
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,870
device then you don't need to perform up

872
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,960
you know penetration test or VA on them

873
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:53,120
but if it does if it has various other

874
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,770
components such as you know it is

875
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,560
connected with through Wi-Fi Bluetooth

876
00:46:54,770 --> 00:47:00,980
or whatever else and if the device is of

877
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:03,440
significance so if it is super

878
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:06,590
complicated or if it's if may apply

879
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,930
plans to buy many of them and if they

880
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:12,940
also might lead to direct patient harm

881
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:17,600
then we will conduct a full technical

882
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:21,590
vulnerability assessment on them and

883
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:24,200
somewhat very sources so the winner

884
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:26,720
ability assessment book we have written

885
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,480
a book that describes all our

886
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,310
methodology for when we perform our

887
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,390
assessment and what we ask the third

888
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:38,509
parties to to do when they when they

889
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:41,660
conduct their own assessments so you can

890
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:43,490
find that it is public it is a docx

891
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,850
basically with all the requirements and

892
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:50,120
inside there is a PDF with winner

893
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:52,819
ability assessment book some other

894
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:57,830
resources there such as the there is the

895
00:47:52,820 --> 00:48:01,190
FDA has had recently posted the post

896
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:03,620
market guidance for securing cyber for

897
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:07,190
securing medical devices and the wasp

898
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:10,060
has released their version 2.0 of the

899
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:19,250
medical device the deployment standard

900
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:21,590
so and this is the this is basically the

901
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:25,030
end of the talk so we have 10 minutes I

902
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:25,030
think for our questions

903
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:34,950
No and that's why I couldn't go into any

904
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:38,730
more technical details we have an MBA

905
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:41,578
with every vendor obviously so we only

906
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:44,280
collaborate with them closely we do have

907
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:47,040
you know read out to them of all our

908
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,579
findings and send Emory the report so

909
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:55,160
that they they fix the findings but we

910
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:55,160
can't publish anything unfortunately

911
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,160
yeah

912
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:37,119
yeah so so both cases sometimes because

913
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:38,589
they have already collaborate in the

914
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,720
past with our team they know that we

915
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:44,320
perform these assessments and sometimes

916
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,180
even if Mayo Clinic hasn't even bought

917
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,339
the device yet they come to us and they

918
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:52,118
say ok do you have time to test this

919
00:49:48,339 --> 00:50:00,160
device and you know it's it's free work

920
00:49:52,119 --> 00:50:04,330
for them but also for us we try to in

921
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:07,690
other other times they do respond well

922
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:09,700
to findings especially especially

923
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:12,339
because Mayo Clinic has a you know great

924
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:16,029
leverage it is a they are a big player

925
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:18,250
in the industry so they know that even

926
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:21,880
if the vendor can say that you know

927
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:24,580
we've gone through their testing or we

928
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,770
we have their approval although they

929
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:32,440
can't say that officially but you know

930
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:36,190
they they usually respond the world to

931
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:39,700
findings especially in the last in the

932
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:43,180
last year previously they you know they

933
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:45,399
were a bit slower in the responses but

934
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:48,129
now they also start to realize that you

935
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,680
know having a good security hygiene is

936
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:53,830
also good publicity program they can

937
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:57,419
market that so they also they have

938
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,420
started to take it more seriously

939
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:22,790
so you mean about physical security

940
00:51:54,970 --> 00:52:12,640
right so what is the question there yeah

941
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:28,430
right yeah there isn't any silver bullet

942
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,880
really so again we have too many of the

943
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:34,730
times we have to find workarounds

944
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,700
physical security since this is somehow

945
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:39,410
correlate it is something that we do

946
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:42,799
inspect as part of our assessment so we

947
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:45,890
do look for you know lack of BIOS

948
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:49,610
passwords or even the locks we've seen

949
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:54,290
for example devices that have a look but

950
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:56,870
they use the same for every device so

951
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:58,430
these are things that we that we try to

952
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,740
look for and then we collaborate with a

953
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,480
clinical practice so if the clinical

954
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:05,629
practice

955
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,730
you know acknowledges and says that you

956
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:10,280
know this printer is gonna stay in a

957
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,710
locked room where only you know

958
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,790
physicians have access and nurses with

959
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:19,280
that you know they have to use their

960
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:21,740
electronic buds then that's fine I mean

961
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,050
that's very mediation by itself if there

962
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,410
is no other way to you know to work

963
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,410
around that

964
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:31,160
another common solution is you know

965
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:34,010
isolating the device so that from the

966
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:37,700
network so you put a photo a hardware

967
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:40,160
firewall in front of it you you know you

968
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:43,100
log it down and then that's the best you

969
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,170
can do so many of the times there isn't

970
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,569
any an easy solution you have to you

971
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:49,280
know the find workarounds and the worst

972
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,660
case scenario is when there is nothing

973
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,580
else you can do and you know the

974
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,649
clinical practice is so persistent in

975
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,290
you know using that device in a very

976
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:00,050
particular way then it ends up to

977
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:02,029
leadership to say you know it escalates

978
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:04,100
the security comedians and they have to

979
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,720
accept the risk like sometimes an

980
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:10,130
enterprise

981
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:14,660
has to say okay I accept Derek that's

982
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:17,270
not so important so we we have to you

983
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:50,109
have to keep clinical workflow and you

984
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:53,060
know that's that's all there is to it so

985
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:58,660
for for IOT device so you mean like

986
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:58,660
cameras or or what what type of devices

987
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:12,740
right so one one of the things that we

988
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:16,880
have established as a process now is

989
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:20,120
that whenever we get a new device we

990
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,070
have to not a specifically but other

991
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:25,880
teams from the oxygen promise figured

992
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:27,590
they have to perform a scan a basics

993
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,110
kind of you know their capabilities like

994
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:32,540
which ports are open all that the basic

995
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:36,200
things that you can find and that's part

996
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:40,850
of the onboarding process so that would

997
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:42,649
lead to some immediate findings such as

998
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:46,130
you know that you have to close this

999
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:48,520
port or the UPnP or whatever so that you

1000
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:52,370
you can have some basic hygiene without

1001
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,960
the other part is that and that's one of

1002
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:55,850
the biggest problems in the industry

1003
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,010
right now is how do you identify these

1004
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:00,290
devices how do you know that you have

1005
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:02,720
because again many of these devices

1006
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,880
might be in the network from you know

1007
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,399
five years ago so asset identification

1008
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,510
is a big problem that's why you see lots

1009
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,850
of startups trying to solve that problem

1010
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:16,850
there were some like cloud post or zinc

1011
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:18,150
box they try to do passive monitoring on

1012
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,819
the network

1013
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:22,710
and try to I you know inspect all the

1014
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:26,280
clear text protocols that these devices

1015
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:29,280
speak and they try to you know

1016
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,750
automatically give you an inventory of

1017
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,510
all these assets that you have

1018
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:35,940
and again they do it by passive

1019
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:38,340
monitoring because you can't do active

1020
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,790
monitoring active probing in the in the

1021
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:45,650
healthcare network because you have the

1022
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:49,970
chance of ruining a medical device so I

1023
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,970
don't know if that answered the question

1024
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:15,710
yeah all right time for drinks
