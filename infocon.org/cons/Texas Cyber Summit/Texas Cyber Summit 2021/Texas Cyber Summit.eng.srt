00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,920
building a purple culture

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,240
i created a write-up specifically for

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
this talk on medium so if you google

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,000
let's get offensive

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,320
building a purple culture or medium and

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,880
cheerio you'll see this particular blog

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,599
post where i'll have all of the

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,680
resources and articles and links in

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,840
there for you so you don't have to take

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,640
notes if you really don't want to

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
so a little known fact is over the past

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
few years i've been studying purple

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,040
teaming as part of my doctoral

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,480
dissertation

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,559
so in february of this year i

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,360
successfully defended my dissertation

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,640
and i'm officially a doctor so in this

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,280
talk i'll be weaving in some of the

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
content from my dissertation

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
but if you want additional context

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,600
please by all means read the 200 plus

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,039
page dissertation or you can always send

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,760
me a quick message via twitter

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
and i'll gladly share all the things

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,040
with you in true millennial fashion

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
complete with texting acronyms and

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,640
definitely some meme references

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
before we get started though i do need

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,240
to share a note from the lawyers that

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
basically i'm here in my individual

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,000
capacity and the opinions expressed in

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
this presentation are mine and mine

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
alone and they do not necessarily

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,360
represent my employers

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,479
all right so now that that's done so

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,840
when you think of purple culture who do

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,560
you generally believe sets the culture

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
at your organization

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
yes cso senior leadership senior

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
management all of that do influence and

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,360
set the culture at your organization but

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,600
i also believe that managers and

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
individual contributors can also

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
influence the culture at the

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,439
organization

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,878
so with that that's pretty much explains

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,200
the angle where i'll be coming from in

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
this particular talk

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
so if you're a manager you can host a

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
workshop with your team members

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,920
where you basically ask them what purple

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,319
culture means to them and what purple

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,040
culture means within your organization

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
you can get an understanding of what

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
they feel

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,160
is working well and what you want to

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,239
continue doing and maybe

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,080
get some ideas for stuff that you want

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
to start doing

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
so to me i believe you know purple

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,160
culture

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
basically empowers the

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
individuals to defend the organization

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
and it's kind of where the offense

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
informs the defense

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
and there's offensive skills across the

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,319
team like i don't need to read the slide

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
but generally this gives you some

72
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,720
talking points so that if you do decide

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,440
to host a workshop to get an idea

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
of where you're currently at regarding

75
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
purple culture you can have some talking

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,080
points

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
so we're gonna address four main areas

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
in this particular talk first we're

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,840
gonna

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
address security operations and

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
offensive application in that area

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
next we're going to talk about the

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,799
organization as a whole

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,519
and see where we can inject some red

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,920
we're going to also talk about

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
defense and see how red can learn some

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,760
defensive skills as well and finally

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,599
thanks to my mba we're going to have a

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
brief discussion

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,399
for managers

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,519
before we get started though i do know

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
that sometimes

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
red teams are luxury at organizations

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,920
they might not be able to afford them

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
and let alone have mature red teams that

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
might be even rarer

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,159
so um

98
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,519
for this talk

99
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,480
just suspend that for a second if you do

100
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,879
happen to be one of those organizations

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,599
and kind of think outside the box so

102
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,159
more and more i'm kind of seeing

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,959
defensive professionals also learning

104
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
offensive skill sets for instance i'm a

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
blue teamer but i also have a couple of

106
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,519
red certs

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
and i really enjoy learning and and

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
engaging uh red professionals

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
so there could be people like that at

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
your organization or you can have people

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
that are willing to learn the red skill

112
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
set whatever combination you have in

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
your organization just keep an open mind

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,720
as you go through this talk

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,479
and uh think outside the box

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,040
so number one we'll address security

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,600
operations and just to give you a little

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,440
bit of context for this

119
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
so that you know kind of where i'm

120
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
coming from i believe that the core

121
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,639
security operations department

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,360
generally includes the sock

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
defer cti hunt detection engineering red

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
if you have it and purple if you have it

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,639
so

126
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
keeping that in mind when you approach

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,880
this you know you can adapt it for your

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,720
organization and however it's organized

129
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,680
and

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,639
if you do decide to do a workshop ask

131
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
ask your teammates where they see

132
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,440
offensive skill sets bringing value to

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,080
the existing operations of the core

134
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,720
security operations department and this

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
is kind of the intention this is

136
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,120
actually the intention behind this

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
particular section

138
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
so i'm going to give you some ideas that

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
you can maybe take back to your

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
organization

141
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
or use to

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
encourage conversation around

143
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,199
so one of the interesting things that

144
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,400
came up in some of the research was

145
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
professionals purple team professionals

146
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,960
sharing how red would sometimes review

147
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
the logs

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,319
including false positives and closed

149
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,240
tickets to be able to spot things that

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,919
may have been missed

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,000
so that is a really great avenue that

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
you can add to your list and see if

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
that's something that you possibly want

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
to

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,880
include or start at your organization

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
the other thing that was also really

157
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
interesting i had a wonderful

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
conversation

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
with a senior leader

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
during my research process and in it he

161
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
really emphasized the importance of red

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
during incidents

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,280
and

164
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,080
how they could add so much value to what

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,479
was going on for the incident response

166
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,600
process

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,479
so i wanted to highlight that and

168
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
to just share how important that is

169
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,479
especially in the event of zero days or

170
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,080
other things happening

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
i really believe that red and the

172
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,840
offensive skill set can bring a lot of

173
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,759
value to the incident response team

174
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,520
so another area that i feel

175
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,919
is really important for red

176
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,479
is training cyber threat intelligence

177
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,720
analysts on procedures and how to

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,280
extract them what to look for

179
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,520
really understanding thread actor

180
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,039
activity and then on top of that

181
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,960
also training the cyber threat

182
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,599
intelligence team to use your

183
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,880
breach attack simulation or bas

184
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,599
solution whatever that may be

185
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,479
and be able to execute the procedures

186
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,560
that they find for the various you know

187
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
threat activity groups or threat actors

188
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,039
that they find in order to validate that

189
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,800
there is either that there are

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,520
detections or visibility or

191
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
uh to potentially submit a detection

192
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,280
based on the procedural level

193
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
information related to the threats that

194
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,720
are potentially impacting your

195
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
organization

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
and another really great area where red

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,879
can offer a lot of value for cyber

198
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
threat intelligence beyond just training

199
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,000
and

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,960
and uh validation detections improving

201
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
the security posture of the organization

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
but also giving ideas to cti to look for

203
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
alternative

204
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,919
uh

205
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,479
alternative procedures when something

206
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
doesn't seem very forthcoming with the

207
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,120
either intelligence that they're

208
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
provided so that they can at least gain

209
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
a little bit of visibility

210
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,960
and have a best effort

211
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,159
kind of approach to building out their

212
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,559
intelligence that they provide to other

213
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
team members

214
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,799
another really great area

215
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,000
where red

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,640
skills can offer a lot of value

217
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,200
is in detection engineering so

218
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
i believe it was uh you know recently

219
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
dave kennedy shared on twitter

220
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,360
how um about the recent microsoft zero

221
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,680
day with

222
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,680
msdt.exe or cve 2022-30190

223
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,440
and he ended up creating a detection for

224
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
it in 2017 for binary defense

225
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,680
and a little a little funniest side is

226
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,240
that subtee or casey smith he made an

227
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
really excellent point

228
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,880
and i i really believe this is part of

229
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
purple culture where offense informs

230
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,959
defense

231
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,160
so you can really leverage your red team

232
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
or red skill set whatever whatever you

233
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,680
have

234
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,480
in order to really build out

235
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
the detections in your organization to

236
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
stay ahead of the potential threat

237
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
landscape or threats that could be

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,480
impacting your organization

239
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
another really great area

240
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
that you can inject some red

241
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,040
into is hunt where they can actually

242
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
have really high fidelity hunts based on

243
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,399
known activity that's provided by the

244
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
red team for whatever technique it is

245
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,120
that the hunt team is interested in so

246
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,800
that they can expand that scope from the

247
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
specific red team activity telemetry

248
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,680
within the logs to other areas on the

249
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
network and potentially find other

250
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,079
badness

251
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
so security operations as a whole so

252
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
once you address the

253
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,760
the immediate core um security

254
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,880
operations various teams think about the

255
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,760
security team as a whole with diver and

256
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,519
cti and

257
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,079
sock and hunt and all of them what would

258
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
they be interested in getting better at

259
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,360
as far as their red skills offensive

260
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
skills being able to spot malicious

261
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,120
activity and so just having that general

262
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
conversation like for instance i would

263
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,360
like to get better at the obfuscating

264
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,519
malicious javascript

265
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,600
or i would like to get better at

266
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,160
analyzing payloads that are not

267
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
necessarily as common so

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
red team can help with this they can

269
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,279
help with whatever it is that you want

270
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,839
or people with red skills to be able to

271
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,720
build the blue tamer skills so that

272
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,320
when

273
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,079
something bad happens here at your

274
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,320
organization their skills will be quote

275
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,680
unquote fresh

276
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,000
and they'll know what to do if that

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
makes sense they'll be practiced another

278
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,680
really great one is a technique review

279
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
so you pick a technique whatever it is

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,839
and red can

281
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,399
go really in depth with it to provide

282
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
that additional context to

283
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
the blue team or sock for whatever it is

284
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,279
that they'll be looking for within the

285
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
logs

286
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,959
so now we'll talk about the organization

287
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,079
in general outside of the core security

288
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
operations team so this could be

289
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
different for various organizations

290
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,760
please apply it to however it works for

291
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,880
you

292
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
so let's say you're taking the workshop

293
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,639
approach

294
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,440
here is where you would ask your

295
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,200
teammates where they see offensive

296
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
skills

297
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
uh bringing value outside the immediate

298
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,959
security organization so i provided some

299
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
ideas

300
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,680
for you

301
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
you can break it down to application

302
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
security exploit dev vulnerability

303
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,399
management maybe risk management

304
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,440
devsecops or even organization wide

305
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
so for appsec you can potentially

306
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,519
onboard a pug bounty program and there's

307
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
a really great reference it's on uh the

308
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
sans white papers and it's called bug

309
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
bounty programs enterprise

310
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,519
implementation and it really goes in

311
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
depth it's by jason pooball

312
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
and it really goes into depth private

313
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,600
versus public explains what you might

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
come up against

315
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
onboarding an enterprise bug bounty

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
program just

317
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
be sure that you have the people

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,040
processes and technology in place before

319
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,880
you approach that

320
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
definitely and read that paper

321
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,200
another one is exploit devs so ryan

322
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
adamson at sands pentest hack fest in

323
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
2021

324
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,160
he gave a really great talk on a

325
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,800
seriously righteous hack about how

326
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,079
you can perform exploit dev and

327
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,920
actually improve the security posture of

328
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,639
the organization by doing that so check

329
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
out that talk if you're interested in

330
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,560
injecting some red into into that area

331
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,279
vulnerability management of course of

332
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,800
course red can be a consult for exploits

333
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
and they're really really helpful in

334
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
letting you know how easy it is to

335
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,000
take advantage of whatever

336
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
vulnerabilities released and they can

337
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
even help prioritize

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
some of the open uh vulnerabilities that

339
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
you have by pointing out oh wow this

340
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,440
privilege escalation this and that can

341
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,240
lead to this so you probably want to

342
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,199
patch that sooner rather than later

343
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,240
another area where red can provide value

344
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
is risk management

345
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,399
so in there you know red of course can

346
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,199
provide consults uh but third-party

347
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,839
vendor review vendor onboarding

348
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,240
maybe mergers and acquisitions where

349
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,839
wherever that fits within your

350
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,360
organization

351
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
and then um also consider security chaos

352
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,920
engineering

353
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
so at the sands purple team summit i

354
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
believe in 2021 carrie

355
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,920
kiss

356
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,880
kistola and dave lavezzo

357
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
they ended up doing a talk called order

358
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,440
through chaos data-driven hypothesis

359
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,680
creation using security chaos

360
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,959
engineering

361
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,279
if you get a chance check it out

362
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,279
also too

363
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,160
during some of the research one of the

364
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,639
participants they actually did

365
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,240
a ctf for the entire organization

366
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,560
and it really brought various teams

367
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,399
together and

368
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
from the information that was shared it

369
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
was it was kind of surprising that there

370
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,760
are people that have skills that maybe

371
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,560
aren't even in the security team that

372
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
did an amazing job on the ctf

373
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,560
so

374
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
expanding that out to the organization

375
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
and using it as a way to build not only

376
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,560
the purple culture but also to build

377
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,959
relationships with people within the

378
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,560
organization is a great solution for

379
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
that

380
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,079
so now we're on to the third area or

381
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,720
defense where red can also get some

382
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,680
defensive skills so once again if you're

383
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
doing the workshop

384
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
if you do have a red team uh you can ask

385
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
how your team thinks that the defensive

386
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,600
skill set or interaction with the the

387
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
defensive teams could potentially

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
benefit the red team

389
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,000
and you can just do some brainstorming

390
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
around that

391
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,639
so

392
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,759
some things to consider or think about

393
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,399
is a red team could do a sock sit-in

394
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
where they get an idea

395
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,560
of what the sock or maybe even deeper

396
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
what deeper goes through or possibly

397
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
even hunt what they go through and

398
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,000
in detecting bread or offensive activity

399
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,720
within the environment attacker activity

400
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
they could also do boss of the sock with

401
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,720
the blue team and really

402
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,320
get an understanding for more of the

403
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,759
tradecraft and also too it can

404
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
you know if if red sits in with the sock

405
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,079
they can kind of see um some of the pain

406
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,560
that uh some of the other uh defensive

407
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
members go through

408
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
you know especially regarding false

409
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
positives and um some of the extra work

410
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,720
that red potentially might create for

411
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,519
them

412
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,279
so that they can get a better

413
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,600
understanding or possibly even have more

414
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,399
compassion or empathy for their blue

415
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,040
teammates and build that relationship

416
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,199
too you know the end goal

417
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
building that relationship building that

418
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
understanding between the various teams

419
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
so that it's not

420
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
so

421
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
adversarial focused of red versus blue

422
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
instead it's red with blue right or blue

423
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,039
with red

424
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,919
so

425
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,280
section four we're gonna have a brief

426
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,919
conversation about managers

427
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,160
and provide some ideas for managers

428
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
so in this um there's a lot of different

429
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,080
things that you can do as a manager one

430
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
of the things that i think is important

431
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,240
to consider is alternative analysis

432
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,520
training

433
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,240
so

434
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,160
you know like i said in the medium

435
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
there's a resource available but in it

436
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,720
it teaches about red teaming

437
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,840
and red teaming mindset

438
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,880
devil's advocacy just

439
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
different alternative alternative

440
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,200
analysis training of like viewing

441
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,679
content and thinking about things

442
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
and i think that that can be potentially

443
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,960
even organization-wide to help with your

444
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,039
critical thinking skills

445
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
another thing is

446
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,280
if red isn't

447
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,200
in the core

448
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,840
security operations function potentially

449
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,039
consider

450
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,919
either

451
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,679
branching off and creating a separate

452
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,760
red team under the core security

453
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,280
operations

454
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,360
or um

455
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,559
or just moving it there entirely

456
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,200
the other thing is

457
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,799
i would recommend

458
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
managers to consider

459
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,799
having a virtual gathering since a lot

460
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,280
of things are still virtual

461
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
for red and blue

462
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
where it's more of a relationship

463
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
building session since they can't

464
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,880
possibly

465
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,039
you know go out to lunch together just

466
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,880
have them get together

467
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,679
talk without manager oversight

468
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,799
and i think that that can do a lot for

469
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,960
building the relationship and helping

470
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,039
break down some walls

471
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,720
um you can also

472
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
encourage them to get together and just

473
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
hack

474
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,000
just hack together

475
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
ask questions

476
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,160
maybe some mentorship or learning

477
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
opportunities across the team

478
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,039
whatever it is this is your team you can

479
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,480
get creative

480
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,440
do ttp fridays or whatever day you want

481
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,400
to do it 30 minutes an hour just

482
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
brainstorm detection ideas if it's

483
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,520
mainly a blue team or learn about how

484
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,679
you think an attack would show up in

485
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,000
your telemetry and maybe

486
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
get a lab going

487
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
with your security stack and actually

488
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
test it out or

489
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
some sort of logging

490
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,799
where you can look at the attack and see

491
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,510
how it's presenting within

492
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,840
[Music]

493
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,200
the logs

494
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
whether or not it's your security stock

495
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
so thank you very much for coming to my

496
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,919
talk

497
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,559
my name is xena olson please feel free

498
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,919
to google

499
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,720
cheerio plus medium and the talk title

500
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
let's get offensive building a purple

501
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
culture for additional references and

502
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
resources

503
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,559
