1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
hi everybody

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,280
welcome to my presentation today we're

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,200
going to be talking about using

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,440
behavioral psychology

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,519
and some analysis techniques to protect

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,440
systems

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,920
so my name is nikki robinson hello

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
i am a security architect with ibm by

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,439
day i am also an adjunct professor by

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,520
night i teach at capital technology

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,880
university

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,039
i currently have a dsc in cyber security

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,119
i was studying vulnerability chaining

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,400
and scoring

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,159
in depth so if you ever want to hear me

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,000
babylon for about three or four hours on

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
vulnerability chaining just let me know

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,879
uh and then i'm wrapping up a phd in

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,200
human factors i have defended

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
my topic which was vulnerability

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
chaining blindness where i was studying

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,239
uh sort of integrating two different uh

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,719
phenomenons together uh to determine if

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,160
this phenomenon of vulnerability

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
chaining blindness exists i'm hoping to

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
publish that before the end of the year

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
so i do hold some certifications

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
industry certifications like cissp and

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,479
ceh i really specialize pretty heavily

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
in vulnerability management but i love

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,119
continuous monitoring risk management

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
research analysis

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
statistics i don't know you name it um

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,080
but specifically in the cyber security

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,759
world i really like to focus on

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,840
vulnerability management

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
but the last year and a half two years

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,680
i've been focused on this human factors

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
research and that's what's really led me

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
to th this presentation i i started

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,799
seeing some of the

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,560
you know the same problems that we see

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,360
over and over again uh phishing attacks

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,680
um you know you name it the same types

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,200
of attacks happening over and over again

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,159
and i started to really ask why why are

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
we still seeing these these same types

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
of attacks conducted and in the same

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,640
ways and how are we not able to to

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,079
protect against these things we know

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,439
that they exist

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
and so i really started to to try to

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
understand how

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,759
we could integrate some psychological

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
uh sort of well-known

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
uh phenomenon well-known and defined

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,439
terminology and and sort of concepts

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
into cyber security to help us sort of

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
start to solve these problems

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,399
you know one of the things that people

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,800
talk about is process and technology and

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,760
people or technology process in people

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,000
but we don't talk a lot about our people

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,760
we talk a lot about the security tools

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,319
that we need we talk a lot about you

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,800
know processes and policy and frameworks

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
but we don't always talk about how our

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
people interact with security whether

69
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,400
that's our users our management

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
uh even our security and i.t

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,480
practitioners so as someone with an it

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,920
operations background who's been in

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,480
security for for about four years now

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,239
you know i'm really trying to to help

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,400
understand where those problems are and

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
uh hopefully by discussing some of these

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,040
things

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,879
we can sort of start to solve those

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
problems

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
so quick disclaimer all thoughts

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
feelings uh views expressed in this

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,160
presentation are my own they do not

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,519
reflect my employers

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,280
so we're going to be talking about a lot

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
of different things today but

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
we're going to start with talking about

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,560
i want to lay some of the groundwork for

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,760
blue red and purple teams um sort of who

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
they are

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,239
why they're important to this

91
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,680
conversation

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
before we dive into cognition

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
perception

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
cognitive limitations which i think are

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,840
really important and then perception and

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
intention so um

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
we're going to sort of lay the

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
groundwork here and then get into some

99
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,239
of the the really fun psychology type

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,599
terminology

101
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
and another quick disclaimer i am not a

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,720
psychologist i'm not a licensed

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,360
therapist or anything like that but i do

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
a lot of research and i think that there

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
is a lot of merit to

106
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
doing some of this academic research and

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
and trying to blend it into what we do

108
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,959
every day as technical practitioners

109
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
so our blue teamers so i can you know i

110
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
can say i'm certainly on the blue team

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
side

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,760
as far as network defense goes i you

113
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
know our blue teamers they really do a

114
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,319
lot of of different tasks when we talk

115
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,760
about blue teams everything from

116
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
continuous monitoring to

117
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
actual network security and defense uh

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
incident response

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
coming up with different types of

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
defensive measures security secure

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
configuration

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,440
application hardening creating baselines

123
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
all of those kinds of things

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
even up to

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
log analysis and correlation so actually

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,280
going through those logs and trying to

127
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
figure out where are the issues where

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
are my problems at what what alerts do i

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
need to configure so so really technical

130
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,440
and hands-on and usually blue teamers

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
work very closely with other teams um

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
they work very closely with with

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,720
management with it maybe with red teams

134
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
as we'll sort of get into in a minute

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,919
but

136
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
people that work on blue teams need to

137
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
have

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
a lot of different abilities not just

139
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,600
technical abilities but they need to be

140
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
able to communicate effectively they

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
need to be able to communicate to very

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
highly technical

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
people that they work with maybe admins

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,720
or engineers but they also really need

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,759
to be able to help management understand

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,320
risk so they have to be able to

147
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
effectively communicate into a technical

148
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
audience as well as a more of a high

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
level management uh to help them

150
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,880
understand where the risk might be and

151
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,479
what needs to be worked on so

152
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,120
prioritization and so that's where we

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,320
start to have the conversation about

154
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,280
where psychology plays in uh people who

155
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,120
work on the sort of continuous

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,199
monitoring side you're probably working

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,960
with system owners like i said admins

158
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,280
and you know you have to sort of be able

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
to tell that story of what

160
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,199
vulnerabilities need to be remediated

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,560
and why

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
to really help people understand you

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
know not just hey i'm here to tell you

164
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,039
you need to implement 300 controls but

165
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,400
here's why

166
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,639
or here's what we can do instead here

167
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
are some mitigating controls that we can

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,440
implement instead so the ability to to

169
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
work really cohesively with other people

170
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
is is an important skill to have on the

171
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
blue team side

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,479
um

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,080
and on the red team side you know uh we

174
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
talk about psychology without really

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
talking in psychological terms which i i

176
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
think is very interesting

177
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,880
because social engineering tactics uh

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
really are behavioral analysis

179
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
understanding how people use social

180
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,000
media what information can you find out

181
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,840
about them online do they like dogs do

182
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
they like cats um do they like long

183
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,680
walks on the beach you know whatever it

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,639
might be but you're really going in and

185
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
trying to determine

186
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,360
uh who who your target is and finding

187
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
out information about them to help you

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
gain access basically to their accounts

189
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,759
uh you know with fishing

190
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,319
if you're calling from the red team side

191
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
you know trying to get a hold of someone

192
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,599
who might give you some information

193
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,880
about other users or about

194
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
email addresses or account information

195
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,800
something like that you're going to be

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
calling and trying to

197
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,759
uh you know use some techniques to

198
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,000
get someone to feel comfortable talking

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,520
with you and that is psychology 100

200
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,440
uh the idea of this hacker methodology

201
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,160
so

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
the idea that

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
you know you're really using this

204
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,639
methodological approach to gaining

205
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,720
access into systems there's a lot of

206
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
persistence that's needed a lot of

207
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,120
determination that's needed a lot of

208
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
sort of this will and this general

209
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
curiosity to be able to actually get

210
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,880
into these systems and i think that it

211
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,639
takes a special type of person to have

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
that sort of determination that will to

213
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
say

214
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
well i couldn't get in this way i'm

215
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
going to try another way and so it's you

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,400
know

217
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
certain personality traits or

218
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,199
experience or interest that sort of lead

219
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,680
into the ability to sort of be you know

220
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
really great at um pen testing

221
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,720
um understanding your targets so from a

222
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,960
psychological perspective you know are

223
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,319
they

224
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,199
um

225
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,800
you know am i trying to target a

226
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
disgruntled employee am i trying to

227
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
target someone who is in financial

228
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,039
distress they might be an easy target

229
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,240
for me

230
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
if i'm trying to gain access into these

231
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
systems

232
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,039
and then what information can i get from

233
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,240
them

234
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
so really trying to understand you know

235
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
who your target is and what valuable

236
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,720
information they might have and how you

237
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
can get it out of them is it an email is

238
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
it a phone call is it a text message is

239
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
it an amazon

240
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,360
uh delivery email that

241
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,879
is spoofed but it you know it looks

242
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,479
legitimate or

243
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
is it something with urgency so really

244
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
trying to understand who your target is

245
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,159
um is certainly uh behavioral analysis

246
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,159
techniques sort of you know very very

247
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,839
much

248
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,440
so and then purple teams i wanted to

249
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,039
highlight this because i do see some

250
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
people talking about purple teams but i

251
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
think it's important to highlight here

252
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,959
there's this really great relationship

253
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
that that can occur if you have

254
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
depending on the size of your

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
organization that you could have between

256
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
red teams and blue teams where you have

257
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
people sort of on this you know

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,399
remediation or network defense side and

259
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
they can really work with red teams to

260
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,519
um have this sort of continuous

261
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,080
iterative process where vulnerabilities

262
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,120
are being found and they're being

263
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
remediated this takes a lot of effective

264
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,000
communication so then we start talking

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
about emotional intelligence the ability

266
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
to have empathy the ability to

267
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,360
understand and comprehend you know sort

268
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,959
of what someone else's objectives and

269
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,360
goals are and how they align with yours

270
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
and how you can work together and

271
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
collaborate to really improve security

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
in your environment

273
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
so i i love the idea of a purple team

274
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,399
sort of ecosystem where you know you

275
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
have your defenders who are finding

276
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,360
vulnerabilities and potentially you know

277
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
helping to categorize and find those

278
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,959
high risks and maybe interacting with

279
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,320
the red team and saying hey i found this

280
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,920
vulnerability are you able to exploit

281
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,360
this is this something that i should be

282
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
really concerned about then your red

283
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,240
teamers can go out there and say yeah

284
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
absolutely let me go see if i can do

285
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
this um you know and vice versa someone

286
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
on a red team someone who's actively

287
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,880
doing a pen test might be able to uh

288
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
exploit something maybe they can conduct

289
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,320
a sql injection or something that nobody

290
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
noticed and they can go back to that

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
blue team and say hey i found this

292
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,760
vulnerability are you able to see this

293
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
in your security scanning software so

294
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
that we can go back and fix this really

295
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,959
quickly

296
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,240
so i felt like it was really important

297
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
to bring up purple teams just because i

298
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
don't hear them being talked about as

299
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
much but i think this can be a really

300
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
big benefit and a great way for for

301
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
people to work together

302
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
all right so let's talk about cognition

303
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,040
so

304
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,839
when i was doing this human factors

305
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,760
research i started to uh really when i

306
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
was reading a lot of psychology books

307
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
you know behavioral psychology

308
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,760
and even some of the you know i had like

309
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
a law enforcement component and so i was

310
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
studying sort of behavioral analysis

311
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,120
techniques um you know when they're

312
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
looking for criminals looking at

313
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,200
profiles things like that and so i i

314
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
started doing a lot of research into

315
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,120
cognition and perception and what i

316
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
really found is there's a lot of

317
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
information there you know psychology

318
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,079
this field has been around for so long

319
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,399
and there are so many uh terms and ways

320
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,279
to help describe phenomenon that i think

321
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,560
could really be beneficial from the

322
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
cyber security side so cognition is

323
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
really uh conscious reasoning

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
but i i love to equate this to chess

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
because i'm a chess player i've been

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
playing for a long time and this really

327
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
analogy really made sense to me when i

328
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,920
was studying this you know how do you

329
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,079
determine what the best move is if you

330
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
are playing a game of chess against an

331
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
opponent you're not just going to think

332
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,519
one move ahead you're not just going to

333
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
think okay well if they move there then

334
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
i'll just try to move here

335
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
wha what really great chess players do

336
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
is you want to be thinking 30 moves

337
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,760
ahead probably at a minimum if i move

338
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,920
here would they move here if i move here

339
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,680
would they also move here what other

340
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,920
possibilities could occur on the board

341
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
when i make this move it's about

342
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,839
implications you know if i move here how

343
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,839
do i think my opponent is going to react

344
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,000
so sort of that the way that we make

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
decisions

346
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,279
and there are a couple of different ways

347
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,120
that we make those decisions

348
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
you know one of them is uh fast thinking

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
so using our intuition

350
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,800
uh if i'm playing a two minute chess

351
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,839
game versus a 30 to 45 minute chess game

352
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,800
i'm gonna be playing those very

353
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,680
differently if i only have one minute to

354
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,000
make decisions on a full chess game i'm

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
going to be using my intuition and my

356
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
my knowledge what i already have with me

357
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
to make those decisions as quickly as i

358
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,639
can versus slow thinking where if i if i

359
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
have an hour of time in a chess match

360
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
then i'm going to probably play that a

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,279
little bit differently i'm really going

362
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,959
to take my time to make those decisions

363
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,639
and say you know is it really worth it

364
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,760
to lose my queen here maybe maybe not

365
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
whereas in a fast game you might need to

366
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,200
lose that queen and just keep moving

367
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,360
and the the final note i wanted to make

368
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
here was on metacognition so

369
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,440
metacognition is

370
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,320
the

371
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
idea that we are

372
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,639
thinking about thinking we're really

373
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,440
trying to identify how did i make those

374
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,720
decisions

375
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
why did i make those decisions why did i

376
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
allow my queen to be taken in that

377
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,839
moment

378
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,399
so you're really analyzing

379
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
how you have made those decisions to

380
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
help make better decisions in the future

381
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,920
figuring out where our limitations are

382
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,399
what we can do to sort of improve those

383
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,560
or maybe find better ways to deal with

384
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,760
those limitations so there's really this

385
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
sort of this understanding of how we

386
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,800
make decisions and in cyber security you

387
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
know that is very very essential

388
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,560
um

389
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,079
so

390
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
tying cognition back to cyber security

391
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,079
for a second

392
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,680
i wanted to bring up security tools

393
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
because you know that's really

394
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,959
especially from you know either side the

395
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,480
red or the blue team side or anywhere

396
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,720
you might be in cyber security our tools

397
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
are sort of our greatest assets we use

398
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,040
them to help us with alerts and logging

399
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,199
and monitoring um

400
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,240
how are we using them how are we how how

401
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
are they created to be used for us

402
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,920
um and and are we using them to the best

403
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,639
of you know the the best that we can are

404
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,480
they configured in a way

405
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
that helps us do our jobs better are we

406
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,240
missing things by having them

407
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,480
misconfigured um

408
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,120
so how are we actually analyzing and

409
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
looking at the tools that we use

410
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
uh on a day-to-day basis because we're

411
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,560
not using those tools effectively we

412
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
might be missing you know a big a big

413
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,720
piece of the picture we might be missing

414
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,199
vulnerabilities if our security scanning

415
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,760
software isn't configured properly

416
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,360
um if our credentials aren't configured

417
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
properly things like that so uh

418
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
considering how we use those security

419
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
tools i think is like a really important

420
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,639
a note here

421
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
um how do we prioritize risk management

422
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
is it an important component

423
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
how do we make those decisions how do we

424
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
decide what risk that we accept

425
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,519
is it based on our business and our

426
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,399
strategy

427
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,720
is it based on our business proprietary

428
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
data is it based on a certain number of

429
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
assets what are we basing our risk off

430
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
of uh so that brings that back to that

431
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,279
decision making component

432
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,880
employee turnover and burnout so uh

433
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,360
am i considering you know my sock

434
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,279
analysts who are working around the

435
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
clock they're constantly looking for

436
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,839
alerts and

437
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
you know working really hard um am i

438
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
considering maybe moving them to another

439
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
group where they don't have to you know

440
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
be on call all the time that they can

441
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,279
sort of

442
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,399
have some breathing room um because you

443
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,160
know if there's too much turnover that

444
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
can actually lead to security issues as

445
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
well if you constantly have this

446
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,320
turnover in your in your sock or or in

447
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
your security teams

448
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,759
which i know is pretty well documented

449
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,680
in in the industry right now when you

450
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
have that turnover it's really difficult

451
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
to establish sort of these you know this

452
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,639
constant sort of steady state of

453
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,399
security um you you have more sort of

454
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,959
fluctuating security and every admin is

455
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,399
going to sort of manage and monitor

456
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,720
tools differently so uh you sort of have

457
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
to consider that as well that there may

458
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
be that learning curve when new people

459
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
come on board

460
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
and then predicting malicious behavior

461
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
again it's where we talk about

462
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
psychology without really talking about

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,959
psychology where uh whether it's a

464
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,839
inside threat or an external threat

465
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
how are we able to predict and determine

466
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,199
uh what a malicious insider looks like

467
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,240
to us

468
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,120
um how what are those indicators

469
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
because depending on the industry or

470
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,279
depending on you know what their job is

471
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,880
that behavior may look differently

472
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,600
and so i wanted to touch on uh

473
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,839
perception next because

474
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,959
uh there is some debate in the uh

475
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,120
psychology world on whether cognition

476
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,040
and perception are sort of the same

477
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,920
thing

478
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,959
um

479
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,759
i personally believe that perception is

480
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,480
its own thing uh cognition you know it's

481
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
really based in decision making and it

482
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
is based on you know our past

483
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
experiences but perception is the idea

484
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,040
that

485
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
we may interpret or handle a situation

486
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
or experience a situation differently

487
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,399
than somebody else based on our

488
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
experiences so

489
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
if me as security engineer

490
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,519
you know i've had a

491
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,400
uh you know a bad experience

492
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,679
um with maybe a tool like i've had a

493
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,039
i've had a really hard time configuring

494
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
it i can't use it properly i may say you

495
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,640
know what my perception is this tool

496
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,319
doesn't work it's terrible

497
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,400
but that's my perception maybe in

498
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
another environment it's configured

499
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,359
properly and it works great but

500
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,319
that limits me on my beliefs on that

501
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,559
tool because based on my own experience

502
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,120
so um that's sort of where that

503
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,960
perception ties in

504
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
and it really comes from this sort of

505
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,360
sensory information that we've received

506
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,960
so it could be how we see something how

507
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
when we touch something how it feels how

508
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,840
we hear something so really based on our

509
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,880
senses

510
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
and there's two different ways that we

511
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,160
process uh information in in this way

512
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
bottom-up processing and top-down uh

513
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,840
processing

514
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
so the bottom-up processing is that

515
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,039
sensory input that i was just talking

516
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,640
about that if you go to the beach and

517
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
you touch the sand that you know what

518
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
the sand feels like and when you

519
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
remember or you think about the beach

520
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
that's what you think about

521
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
versus the top-down processing which is

522
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
how we interpret these sensations but

523
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
they are influenced by our experiences

524
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,320
so if i walk into a door and i stub my

525
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,200
toe

526
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,320
um

527
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
i'm going to probably remember what that

528
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,760
feels like because i remember that

529
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
sensation of me stubbing my toe in the

530
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,039
door and wow that really hurt um so it's

531
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
it's uh really interesting to sort of

532
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,039
see the different ways that we process

533
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,720
this information and how it affects the

534
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,000
way we perceive situations

535
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,799
so tying that back to cyber security

536
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,480
how do our past experiences influence

537
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
our decision making this is one of the

538
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,000
most important notes that i want to make

539
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
from this presentation is something to

540
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
take away and consider in your own

541
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,320
environment in your own world in your

542
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,600
own organization on your own team

543
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,559
how has past experiences influence

544
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,080
security and decision making in your own

545
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,840
uh environment

546
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
so for example if

547
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,440
you had an experience with someone that

548
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
you know you were constantly trying to

549
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
make something happen you're trying to

550
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,039
constantly make a project happen and

551
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,720
you're working with someone and maybe

552
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,919
you know they're not responsive or

553
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,200
they're not getting back to you or

554
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
something might be happening

555
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,600
where you're not getting those responses

556
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,080
that may influence my decision to work

557
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
with that individual again i might say

558
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,039
you know what they weren't really

559
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,400
responsive last time i'm not going to

560
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
ask them to help

561
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
but what might have really been going on

562
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,440
is maybe they were overloaded with other

563
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,880
projects maybe they were having

564
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,640
technical issues maybe they were having

565
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,919
personal issues and they were really

566
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
just out of the office

567
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
and just hadn't really talked about it

568
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
or some any other number of things but

569
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,120
that perception uh will live with me

570
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,559
because i'll say yeah gosh you know i

571
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,679
don't i think i'm going to consider it

572
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,360
before i work with that person again

573
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,520
and this other idea of being able to pay

574
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,039
attention

575
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,919
so

576
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
if i'm looking at alerts all day if i'm

577
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,039
staring at you know a dashboard all day

578
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,520
how much can i really stare at this

579
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,840
before i start losing interest and start

580
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,640
losing information so if i'm staring at

581
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,559
alerts all day long alerts alerts alerts

582
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,919
they keep coming through

583
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,919
at some point i'm gonna get bored and

584
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,679
i'm not gonna be looking at them as

585
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,760
effectively as i probably would be at

586
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
the beginning when i was really looking

587
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
through alerts so

588
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
how long do you have stock analysts

589
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
looking at alerts is it all day long

590
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,039
that they just constantly are reviewing

591
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,240
these things and looking at dashboards

592
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
or are they able to take breaks are they

593
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,559
able to you know do it for 30 minutes

594
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,679
and then take 30 minutes and do

595
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,799
something else and then come back to it

596
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,000
for 30 minutes so think about where the

597
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,919
how long somebody's able to actually

598
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,720
ingest this information um in a

599
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,799
a really good way

600
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,960
because we all can only handle so much

601
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,799
uh how does the organization perceive

602
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,799
security so

603
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,360
and not just from a top-down approach

604
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,320
but how do users perceive security how

605
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,919
do they perceive the security team do

606
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,720
they know who the security team is

607
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,480
is that maybe part of why they don't

608
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,919
care about security or they're just not

609
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,600
as interested in it

610
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
so how do

611
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
how does hr perceive security how does

612
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,919
you know finance perceive security so

613
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
thinking about how other teams might

614
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,679
actually think about the security team

615
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,760
or maybe not know them

616
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,440
and then uh

617
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
you know thinking back again to when

618
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,960
we're talking about cognition

619
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,480
how do we properly configure our

620
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
security tools so

621
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
that perception that i had of that tool

622
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,679
that i couldn't get working right and i

623
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,960
i just couldn't get it and so now i

624
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,120
don't like it but maybe it is a really

625
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,039
great effective tool maybe i need to go

626
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,200
back and say hmm what did i do wrong

627
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,039
with that tool maybe we can try it again

628
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,880
and see if it wasn't the tool that was

629
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,480
the problem maybe it was me

630
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,159
the practitioner that didn't understand

631
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,159
the tool well enough you know to to

632
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,240
really configure it properly which is

633
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,799
fine right we can't know every tool so

634
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,480
uh so i think that that's sort of uh

635
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
what is my perception of the tools that

636
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,840
i use and how do i use them

637
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
so cognitive limitations and this is

638
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
sort of where i was getting at with the

639
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
how many alerts do we manage and monitor

640
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,799
a day uh

641
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,000
we have only so much that we can take in

642
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
and keep and store in our memory and our

643
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
attention there's only so long that we

644
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,880
can look at something and do something

645
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
before we lose that that really great

646
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,080
focus and intention um attention on what

647
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,120
we're doing

648
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,720
so

649
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,760
this is a pretty well researched area of

650
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,919
psychology and even in technology where

651
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,120
you know there's only so long we can

652
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,720
stare at a screen there's only so long

653
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
that we can really sit and do a task

654
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
before we have to get up and move around

655
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,520
and then how do we actually visualize

656
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,640
a different scales of problems so am i

657
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,840
able to understand and comprehend and

658
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,960
perceive

659
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,120
a situation

660
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,880
in the same way that somebody else might

661
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
so

662
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
uh let's take for example solarwinds

663
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,840
because we all know that one right

664
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
um

665
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
we all probably perceived that well a

666
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
lot of us perceive that as a pretty big

667
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,480
threat right that that was a pretty

668
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,440
serious

669
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,240
uh concern and making sure that you know

670
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
what what do we have this in our

671
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
environment where is it in our

672
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,880
environment um

673
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,960
but was i able to

674
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
you know could i perceive

675
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,760
the overall sort of overarching big

676
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,559
picture threat which was that you know

677
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,000
it's not just solar winds it may be

678
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,440
other tools in the environment there may

679
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
be other things going on that i'm not

680
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
aware of yet and i need to be prepared

681
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,520
for that um as a as a security

682
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,240
practitioner so sort of understanding

683
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,039
the scale of those problems

684
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,360
and then uh thinking about

685
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
uh the complexity this is one of those

686
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
things i talk about a lot but

687
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,039
because i think it's important

688
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
our systems our organizations and

689
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,159
security is really really complex

690
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,520
the amount of vulnerabilities that are

691
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,559
released

692
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
daily the amount of you know experience

693
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
we have to have with different tools and

694
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,799
you know networks and configurations and

695
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,760
cloud platforms and sas and all of these

696
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
things that we need to understand as sec

697
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,880
security practitioners you know it's it

698
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
gets very complex and there is only so

699
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
much information that we can ingest

700
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,240
so

701
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,159
uh it's one of those things that i i've

702
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,600
liked to bring up from an awareness

703
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,159
perspective that you know when we ingest

704
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
so much information that we're probably

705
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,840
going to forget some things too

706
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
because we have to constantly be taking

707
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,520
in all this new information on threats

708
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
and vulnerabilities and systems and

709
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
working with people and all of these

710
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
things so uh just understanding that

711
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,799
there's quite a bit of complexity within

712
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,320
those within those systems

713
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,720
and then uh intention versus perception

714
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,000
so

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
this is something that i think is uh

716
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,559
it's something i i really want to study

717
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,880
more i think that there are

718
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,559
there's not enough data out here

719
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,559
specifically in cyber security and i

720
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,000
think we we need this data to understand

721
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,279
how intention and perception can create

722
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,919
an insecure environment basically

723
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,880
so

724
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,760
if i intend

725
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,559
to

726
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
have a conversation with someone and i

727
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
provide them you know

728
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,919
i need you to fix 30 vulnerabilities

729
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,720
okay well how did that interaction go

730
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,400
was i

731
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
did i provide enough information or did

732
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
i say just fix these 30 vulnerabilities

733
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,159
just do it

734
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,000
or did i provide context and say well

735
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,279
there's 30 vulnerabilities that need to

736
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,039
be remediated but these are the top five

737
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,960
that need to be done today the rest we

738
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,120
can discuss and make a plan for and talk

739
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
about and so did i work with the person

740
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
or did i you know just sort of give them

741
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,400
this and say just go do it so uh to

742
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,039
understand from sort of that perspective

743
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,039
well did i

744
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,919
provide them enough information enough

745
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,159
context how did they perceive that

746
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,360
interaction

747
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
did that interaction go poorly for them

748
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
have they had security people in the

749
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,640
past tell them you know hey you have to

750
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
get this done and there was no

751
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,279
context or information

752
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,960
uh that could really change the

753
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,640
perception in the way that that person

754
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,159
works with me in the future um and it

755
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,799
may make them not want to fix security

756
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,520
vulnerabilities either uh

757
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,559
what if

758
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
they've changed settings in the past and

759
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
it's broken their environment maybe

760
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
they've gotten yelled at by management

761
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,080
because they made a change that security

762
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,279
told them to make and then it broke the

763
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,080
environment uh how you know their

764
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
perception of of changes to the

765
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
environment is going to be a lot

766
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,360
different because they understand that

767
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,039
their functionality

768
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,880
and operational environment might go

769
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,320
down and so they they're going to have a

770
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
different perception of sort of fixing

771
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,640
these vulnerabilities and so it's this

772
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,600
sort of

773
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,360
give and take where

774
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
we have to sort of figure out how does

775
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,400
perception actually affect the secure

776
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,120
and security and secure configuration of

777
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
our systems so there's a lot more

778
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
research that i'd really like to do here

779
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,559
and and sort of dig in to understand

780
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,559
um so what can you do about it uh i i

781
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,240
think it's really important when doing

782
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,840
sort of a presentation or talking to

783
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,039
people to

784
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,880
uh give a really good idea of what you

785
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,360
can actually do with this information

786
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,240
um i do think that we don't talk enough

787
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,679
about security within other fields

788
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,360
you know think about um like biology do

789
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,039
they have a cyber security course i

790
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,440
don't i don't think so probably not

791
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,240
but why not a biologist is going to be

792
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
using a computer just as much as i would

793
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,760
use a computer so why do we not teach

794
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,000
you know cyber security in undergraduate

795
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,960
programs um in all fields of study

796
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,760
we're all tethered to technology in some

797
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,200
form or fashion

798
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,799
and uh

799
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,120
even healthcare you know how

800
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,159
are nurses and doctors receiving

801
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,159
any sort of cybersecurity education as

802
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,760
part of their programs they use

803
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,240
computers and tablets all the time with

804
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
patient information and phi so um so we

805
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
should consider having cyber security as

806
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,880
part of everyone's education

807
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
uh awareness

808
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
uh so just doing some research i think

809
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,440
that's the best way to sort of

810
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,600
understand how psychology and

811
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
psychological principles might help

812
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,440
better protect your systems really at

813
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,159
the end of the day um there are so many

814
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,520
you know i only touched on a few but

815
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,440
like cognition and metacognition and how

816
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,080
we actually process information i think

817
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
understanding those principles and how

818
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,159
they might affect our security teams

819
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,240
could help us understand our team

820
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,679
members better it could help us

821
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,799
understand the security of our

822
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,480
environment better

823
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
and and really sort of mature our cyber

824
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
security programs because that's really

825
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,679
what should be happening is we should be

826
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,360
working towards maturing our cyber

827
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,520
programs and i think by integrating

828
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
psychology integrating some human

829
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
factors engineering sort of principles

830
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,679
uh can certainly help us do that

831
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,600
uh consider hiring someone with a

832
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,440
background in psychology

833
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,840
um i actually know someone who

834
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,679
came from cognitive

835
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,480
psychology into cyber security uh dr

836
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,840
margaret cunningham and she is a

837
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
phenomenal researcher

838
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
she is such great insight and so i think

839
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,760
that having having more people with a

840
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,200
background in psychology and cyber

841
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,279
security is only going to help us

842
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,480
understand the problems a lot more um

843
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,039
and then really understanding cognitive

844
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,679
limitations and i think from

845
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,600
a practitioner standpoint understanding

846
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,520
what our cognitive limitations are so

847
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,880
sort of understanding okay how much

848
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,760
information can i really digest versus

849
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,640
how much information uh you know am i am

850
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,120
i taking in and then actionably you know

851
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
putting something towards and then from

852
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,960
a management perspective understanding

853
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
that you know

854
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,399
practitioners we can only ingest so much

855
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,159
information at a time and trying to

856
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,240
figure out the ways to augment or

857
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,399
automate uh some of the ways that we

858
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,080
look at alerts and and that we handle

859
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,240
some of our systems to sort of help cut

860
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,559
down on the the sort of that fatigue

861
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,760
that we get

862
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,840
um and then thinking about human factors

863
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
and design and how that plays into

864
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,960
security tooling

865
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,840
so

866
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,320
it's not always you know i hear this

867
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
sometimes it's like well this tool isn't

868
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,279
doing what it's supposed to be doing and

869
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
we need to replace it and get a new tool

870
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,039
nine times out of ten doing that

871
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,679
uprooting an entire infrastructure just

872
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,520
to integra implement a new tool is gonna

873
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
be really expensive

874
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
and chances are the tool could

875
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
potentially be configured in a better

876
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,200
way not always um that's not always the

877
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
case but it is possible that the tool

878
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,799
could be configured in a better way

879
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,799
re-architected in some way instead of

880
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,919
ripping it out and trying to put

881
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,320
something brand new in there um

882
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,120
so so that's always an option uh to sort

883
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,720
of cut down on budget and things like

884
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,880
that but i always think about it from a

885
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
you know how can we sort of

886
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,919
make our tools better that we use and uh

887
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,760
so i think thinking about what tools you

888
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,679
have in the environment maybe even

889
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,840
consolidating some tools because that's

890
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
the other thing if we have 10 tools in

891
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,760
our in our toolbox and it we have

892
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
cognitive limitations there's only so

893
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,279
much we can look at in a day it's very

894
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,799
possible that we run out of time to

895
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,240
actually be able to configure these

896
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,799
tools properly so so think about the

897
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,919
security tooling you have in your

898
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,720
environment and what's really necessary

899
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,799
and what's being used and is it being

900
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,000
utilized

901
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,279
to the best of its ability

902
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,480
um and so that's it for me uh that is my

903
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
conclusion here um please feel free to

904
