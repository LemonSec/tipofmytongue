and i'm honored to be presenting at the

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,840
texas cyber summit this year welcome to

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,200
my talk today

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,920
invitation to

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,680
exploitation risks from mass iot

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,039
vulnerabilities

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,840
i hope you enjoy

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,720
a little bit about me

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
i am a threat intel specialist with td

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
bank here in canada

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,399
let me give a shout out to my awesome

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,040
team that i'm very lucky to work with

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
i'm also a founding member of the diana

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,800
initiative

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,879
supporting diversity and equality in our

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,320
field

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
i'm very grateful to the terrific staff

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,760
volunteers and supporters who helped

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,840
make another wonderful online event

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,199
happen this year

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,440
and i hope you can join us in person

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000
next year

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
obligatory disclaimer time the views

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,039
expressed here today are mine alone and

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,480
not those of my employer

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,560
so let's get started

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
as the saying goes

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,680
you don't know what you don't know

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,240
and with this talk i want to show you

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,799
how that really applies to the internet

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
of things or as we call it iot

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,720
and the insecurity and risk from math

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,200
embedded vulnerabilities

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
i'd like to use some takeaways to better

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,680
understand iot in enterprise

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
environments in terms of definition

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
threats and attacks

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,240
and also give you some recommendations

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,320
so that you can better secure what you

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,960
have in place and enhance your current

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,919
security policies

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,280
let's start with defining iot

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
consider these to be

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,920
points of ingress that can lead to

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,880
further

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
access

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
now there's a lot of iot interpretation

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,600
out there and it kind of looks like this

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,239
so that they can communicate with other

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
means devices internet connectivity to

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,040
physical devices ordinary objects

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,080
and an iot comes in different flavors

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
there's enterprise iot

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,480
industrial iot

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,440
internet of health iot

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,760
this is tech that communicates machine

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,879
to machine

61
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,040
or mobile to mobile

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,920
so

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
what we're doing here is expanding

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,480
beyond our defined security and

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
monitoring perimeters to connect

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
physical devices that were not

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,040
originally designed to connect

68
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
and we're adding digital intelligence to

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,159
enable communications and then taking us

70
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,360
the humans

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,519
out of the equation

72
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
in that sense we are handing over our

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
control to the machines

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,400
let me leave that with you

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
okay

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,400
when you add iot into your enterprise

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
environment you get tada the enterprise

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
of things

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
and that's what happens when we bring

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
all the things that connect into

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,319
organizational networks

82
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,040
now much of it is related to operational

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
tech or ot

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
tied to achieving the goals and outcomes

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
of a line of business

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
many iot devices

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
are unmanaged systems that can

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
communicate with other devices and

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
systems in your organization

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,360
they process and transmit information

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
they have an operating system no matter

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,519
how simple that is

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,599
but they cannot be managed via

94
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,760
traditional security tools

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
they don't let us configure them to be

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
better we're stuck with what we get

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
and those unmanaged endpoints

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
don't really have any built-in security

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,519
that we can manage

100
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,280
think plug and play

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,959
convenience my friends

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
has become the root of all evil

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,159
so when iot becomes eot

104
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,959
that attack surface increases and so

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
does our liability

106
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,320
it's everywhere

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
in manufacturing there's automation

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
sensors and scanners robots on the

109
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,199
manufacturing floor

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,360
in healthcare they use it to cut costs

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
and improve the quality of care for

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,320
patients

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,400
there's remote patient monitoring

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
telemedicine

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
pumps

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,160
mri machines patient monitors in fact

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
there can be as many as 15 connected

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
devices per bed now there have been some

119
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,479
excellent talks about iot in medical

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
devices and the security risks

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,919
associated

122
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,919
let me give a shout out to the members

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,160
of i am the cavalry

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
and the very important work that they've

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
been doing

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,080
now businesses and corporations use

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
smart tvs and digital conferencing

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
as well as printers and scanners

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
retail uses it everywhere it can

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
there's beacons that push out messages

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,440
at the point of sale automated checkout

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,639
kiosks which are showing up increasingly

133
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
inventory management through smart

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
shelves tracking or monitoring for theft

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
and digital displays

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,600
transportation and logistics use sensors

137
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
for warehouse management

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,919
they use it on vehicles to help track

139
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,639
the locations or for fuel consumption

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
for delivery times and to reroute

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
vehicles

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
and then there are wearables that allow

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
workers to communicate with their

144
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,160
colleagues

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
in buildings and facility management

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
there's security webcams locks lighting

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
and hvac systems

148
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
that's a whole lot of vulnerability just

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,880
waiting to happen

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,039
and then covet 19 happened

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,080
now a new study by zscaler looked at iot

152
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,680
devices that were left on corporate

153
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
networks during the pandemic

154
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,880
575 million device transactions and

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,919
300 000 iot specific malware attacks

156
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
were blocked over a two-week period in

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,479
december of 2020.

158
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
that measured as an increase of 700 from

159
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,520
pre-pandemic levels

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,639
and the attacks targeted 553 different

161
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,680
types of devices all connected to and

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
communicating with corporate i.t

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,039
networks

164
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,160
while the workforce was remote

165
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,039
so

166
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,880
76 of these devices were communication

167
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,919
on unencrypted plain text channels

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,840
let that sink in

169
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
that's the majority of iot transactions

170
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
and it poses a significant risk to the

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,919
organization

172
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,280
the highest traffic came from

173
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,840
manufacturing and retail industries with

174
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,039
59 of transactions measured

175
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,919
enterprise was second with 28

176
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,039
healthcare was third with eight percent

177
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,919
expect the unexpected there were smart

178
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
fridges and

179
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,080
musical lamps sending traffic through

180
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
corporate networks

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,599
do you know what's on your network

182
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
so what could go wrong

183
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
well think refrigeration on trucks

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
the temperature control fails

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
the sensor does not alert

186
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
valuable cargo spoils

187
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
that's money lost

188
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,599
let's talk about something bigger

189
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
think hvac systems anywhere we work live

190
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,240
or stay

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
what if there was an outbreak of an

192
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,680
airborne contagion like legionnaires

193
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
disease

194
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,919
think quality control that regulates the

195
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,360
safety of what we eat or what we use

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,759
and if those are tampered with

197
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,120
would we know

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
if somebody changed the settings just

199
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,879
enough

200
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
how would we know

201
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,639
call me paranoid

202
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,080
we rely on these devices to be reliable

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
to notify us

204
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,879
we

205
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,319
trust them

206
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
let's talk about the architecture

207
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
there are a lot of protocols involved

208
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,639
with all of those connections and even

209
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,879
if these are just simple devices doing

210
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,560
one task

211
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
we're going to talk now about why

212
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,039
understanding the vulnerabilities in

213
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,399
these protocols matters because

214
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,519
embedded devices

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
these are the four communications

216
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,039
architectures used there's device to

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,760
device so that iot devices within the

218
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
same network

219
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
generally connect using wireless pan

220
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,080
protocols like bluetooth and zigbee

221
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
there's device to cloud

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
iot devices connect directly to the

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,920
cloud typically they use a long-range

224
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,839
communications network such as cellular

225
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,160
and then there's device to gateway

226
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,560
these architectures transfer information

227
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
from sensors to the cloud

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
via a gateway device which collects the

229
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,560
data and then communicates it to the

230
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,640
cloud through additional network

231
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,120
connectivity like wi-fi or cellular

232
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
connections

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
and then there's cloud to cloud this is

234
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,640
also known as back-end data sharing and

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,959
it enables third parties to access

236
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
uploaded data from iot devices

237
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,279
for example

238
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
smart buildings receiving data from

239
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
smart thermostats and smart light bulbs

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,640
which can send the data to the cloud via

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,399
wi-fi

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
now there are wireless sensors and

243
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,440
actuators which provide the connection

244
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
between the digital and physical worlds

245
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
they work together to produce and

246
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,279
collect vast amounts of user data

247
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,839
the actuators can produce physical

248
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
changes based on the data that they get

249
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,640
from the sensors and they can shut off a

250
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,360
device or move equipment

251
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
think back to how we were talking about

252
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
handing over control to the machines and

253
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,040
what could go wrong

254
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,279
iot devices can be grouped according to

255
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
the type of connection they require

256
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,079
devices which need a lot of range and

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,360
bandwidth

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
would use cellular or satellite

259
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
connections

260
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,200
for things that transmit small amounts

261
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,480
of data the best option is to have

262
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,640
an lp1 or

263
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
low-range wan connection

264
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,760
these technologies offer less bandwidth

265
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
but they make up for it in terms of

266
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,240
energy efficiency

267
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,320
manufacturers can also choose between

268
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,839
wi-fi bluetooth or ethernet connections

269
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
and these standards provide more

270
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,800
bandwidth

271
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
but at the cost of shorter range

272
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
there's system on module or som which

273
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
integrate a system function into a

274
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,760
single module this brings simplicity and

275
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,640
intelligence to an embedded iot system

276
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
with reduced power

277
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
for iot applications

278
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
integrated wireless connectivity enables

279
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,720
broad deployment

280
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,200
in numerous scenarios

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
the low power consumption is a high

282
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
priority

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
one of the benefits of psalms is that

284
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
they can reduce the time and cost to

285
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,880
develop a pcb based design

286
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
then there's also a single board

287
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
computer or an sbc

288
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
and that provides an entire computer

289
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
built on a single circuit board it'll

290
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
include microprocessors memory

291
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
input output and connectivity

292
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,680
but it's not a desktop personal computer

293
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,240
it doesn't have expansion slots

294
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
now some of these can even offer

295
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
pre-certified wi-fi or bluetooth

296
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
connectivity

297
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,959
they even in some cases can offer

298
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,399
enterprise level security

299
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
for the architecture

300
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,639
let's make it simple and talk about it

301
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
in terms of the three layers

302
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,519
first there's the physical layer

303
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,399
this has the sensors actuators smart

304
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,040
devices the things

305
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,279
they are at the edge of the iot network

306
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,800
or edge nodes

307
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
and they interface and communicate to

308
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,279
the cloud via wire or localized radio

309
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,399
frequency

310
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,079
rf networks

311
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,160
and this is done through gateways

312
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,959
now

313
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
some will come internet ready right out

314
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
of the box and require little or no

315
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,639
configuration

316
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,079
then there's others

317
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,079
older or legacy items and they use

318
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,240
conventional methods like analog or

319
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,079
serial connections

320
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,560
these conventional devices get connected

321
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,760
to microcontrollers systems on modules

322
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
the psalms or single board computers the

323
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
sbcs that we talked about

324
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,519
via arduinos net burners or raspberry

325
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,800
pi's

326
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,240
and you're probably familiar with those

327
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,279
next are iot gateways

328
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
these act as your middlemen

329
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,560
they're the messenger and translator

330
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,320
between the cloud and the smart device

331
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,760
clusters

332
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,279
gateways are not always cloud however

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,920
physical devices or software programs

334
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
will run from the field and in close

335
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,720
proximity to the edge sensors and other

336
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,480
devices

337
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
their job is mostly to normalize connect

338
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,040
and then transfer data between the

339
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,760
physical device layer and the cloud

340
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
and they can also support additional

341
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
computing and peripheral functions such

342
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,800
as telemetry or multiple protocol

343
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,439
translation

344
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,880
filtering massive raw sensor data

345
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,199
provisioning or device management

346
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
and last is the application layer or the

347
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,680
cloud

348
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,000
it communicates with the gateway by the

349
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,399
internet or wired or cellular

350
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,160
connections

351
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,959
a lot of raw data is being collected by

352
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,040
all of those sensors and it's going to

353
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,120
need a lot of processing power and space

354
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,839
this is more complicated than we realize

355
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,480
this diagram can depict for you

356
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,880
the data and control flows that are

357
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,079
based on usage across enterprise systems

358
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,760
spanning the three networks that are

359
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,199
shown here with three tiers there's edge

360
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,760
platform and enterprise

361
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,800
essentially these are things talking to

362
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,519
things and the devices are on the far

363
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,560
left

364
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,199
the protocols are in the middle and are

365
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,760
likely the vendor of the item

366
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,600
we the enterprise

367
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,040
talk to the vendor

368
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
and on the right is us the enterprise

369
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
customer consuming that data video

370
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,639
streams sensor logs etc

371
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,279
so to recap

372
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,839
there are three layers

373
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,240
billions of physical devices some of

374
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,760
which can produce physical changes

375
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
we're monitoring the data flow across

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
three networks

377
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
and there are challenges integrating iot

378
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,720
into established enterprise networks

379
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,199
so how is it that iot tax differ

380
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,519
let's start with this

381
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
let's be clear

382
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,920
hyper connectivity in the rush to market

383
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
we overlook security in the software

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,839
defined life cycle

385
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,000
so devices get shipped that cannot be

386
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
updated

387
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,800
or with limited capacity to be updated

388
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
and as iot moves into a range of

389
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,639
enterprise environments

390
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,959
driven by consumer demand and byod

391
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,160
desire

392
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
shadow i.t becomes shadow e.t and it

393
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
brings new challenges and risks that our

394
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,600
existing compliance and security don't

395
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,279
address or regulate

396
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,680
now most organizations still don't

397
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,399
inventory iot devices because

398
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,639
they don't have centralized control over

399
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
what iot devices and apps are in their

400
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,399
workplace

401
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,480
how are you inventorying the personal

402
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,600
devices used by staff is it byo iot

403
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,079
risk gets pushed along the supply chain

404
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
so that whoever buys it

405
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
owns it

406
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,600
let's apply the cia triangle

407
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,759
confidentiality integrity and

408
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,120
availability

409
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,519
we're used to attacks or breaches being

410
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,399
primarily focused on data exfiltration

411
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
for identity theft

412
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
credit card fraud ransomware etc

413
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,680
that's confidentiality

414
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,759
now in the iot world there's some of

415
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,759
that but connected devices have more

416
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,160
riding on them they run things that we

417
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,120
need and rely on attackers turn devices

418
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
against the company

419
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,359
so it's more about disruption or even

420
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,559
destruction

421
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,359
an impact is measured in damage that

422
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,199
becomes dollars

423
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,079
this

424
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,240
becomes availability

425
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
or potentially integrity

426
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,760
and attackers can carry out

427
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,240
man in the middle spoofing

428
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,439
cloning

429
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,039
or software attacks to steal credentials

430
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,840
as an example of an attack

431
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,880
in april 2019 microsoft's threat

432
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,480
intelligence center discovered a

433
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,559
targeted attack by strotium or apt-28

434
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
against iot devices

435
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,760
the plan was to use compromised iot

436
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
devices as access points into the

437
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,000
broader corporate network

438
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
and there were attempts across multiple

439
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
customer locations

440
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
they tried exploits against a voip phone

441
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,200
a printer and a video decoder

442
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,000
now

443
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
two of the three devices still carried

444
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
factory security settings

445
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
and the software in the third had not

446
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,120
been updated

447
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,360
if we take a look at our wheel of

448
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
misfortune

449
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,440
breaches resulting from unsecured iot

450
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,640
devices

451
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,039
increased by 26 in 2020 up from 15 in

452
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,720
2017

453
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,039
these devices can collect very sensitive

454
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,520
data connected devices are always

455
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
communicating with other devices on the

456
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,480
network

457
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,440
according to paulo alto 98 of enterprise

458
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
iot communications are in plain text

459
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
unsecured

460
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,080
now iot devices are low hanging fruit

461
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,280
and 57 are vulnerable to medium or even

462
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
high severity attacks

463
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,640
83 percent of medical imaging devices

464
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
run on

465
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,840
unsupported operating systems

466
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
and to illustrate the effect of an iot

467
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,080
attack within enterprise systems i give

468
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
you

469
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
polycom

470
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,280
because doesn't every organization have

471
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
teleconferencing

472
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,160
and a lot of them have polycoms

473
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
now there are a lot of endpoints in

474
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,320
these systems and they each have their

475
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
own security and risk factors to

476
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
consider

477
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
more importantly every single endpoint

478
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
presents an opportunity to get into the

479
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
network

480
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,679
so who actually likes these very likely

481
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
but i don't think they're thinking about

482
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,120
security when they're setting it up

483
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,160
now

484
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
this is about an attack on the

485
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,720
republican https

486
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,520
that was discovered by omni in august of

487
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
2018.

488
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
thousands were exposed externally and

489
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,440
many more were deployed internally

490
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,880
systems are linked to each other

491
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,799
devices

492
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,760
operating systems

493
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,720
it just takes one

494
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,919
devices that have default passwords or

495
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
pins

496
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,440
so

497
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,320
let's do a recap

498
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,760
this is not the same old same old

499
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
we need to evaluate what we've got in

500
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
place because attackers can leverage and

501
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,159
pivot each endpoint becomes a point of

502
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,120
ingress for further access

503
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,039
you can't secure what you don't know

504
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,120
default configurations

505
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,200
have you looked for undocumented

506
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,799
backdoor accounts

507
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,880
misconfiguration

508
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,960
what do you have turned on by default

509
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,559
that exposes you

510
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,799
and could be turned off

511
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,000
universal plug-and-play or open ports

512
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and what are the firmware update

513
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
policies for these devices

514
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
can you get automated updates

515
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,799
network segmentation for the win because

516
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,520
we can do this better

517
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,039
okay let's talk about those attacks

518
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
a series of massive vulnerabilities

519
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,440
starting in 2019 that were identified

520
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,400
now taking action to remediate is hard

521
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
device vendors would need to take the

522
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
updated tcp stacks and integrate them as

523
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
firmware updates into their products

524
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,880
the thing is many vulnerable devices

525
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
don't even ship with the ability to

526
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
update the firmware

527
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,559
meaning that some equipment will most

528
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,559
likely remain vulnerable for the rest of

529
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,280
its shelf life

530
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,120
and this

531
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,039
this is what i wanted to share with you

532
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,120
today because this is truly a series of

533
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,799
unfortunate events

534
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,840
waiting to happen

535
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
our story starts here

536
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
with urgent 11

537
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
july of 2019

538
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
a set of 11 vulnerabilities which

539
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,720
affects the tcp ip stack in vxworks

540
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
known as ipnet

541
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
the most widely used operating system

542
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,159
that you've probably never heard of

543
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,000
of these are critical and can enable

544
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,440
remote code execution

545
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,919
and if there's a wide range of affected

546
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,640
versions spanning 13 years

547
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,679
now how many manufacturers use vxworks

548
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,720
well

549
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,960
it's found in over 2 billion devices

550
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,039
attackers can circumvent the network

551
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,640
address translation or nat and firewalls

552
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
to control devices remotely via flaws in

553
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,960
the tcp ip stack

554
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
undetected

555
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,880
with no user interaction required

556
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
and the vulnerabilities have a low level

557
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,520
position in the stack so that attacks

558
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,600
are viewed as legitimate network

559
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
activity and since the vulnerabilities

560
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
don't require any adaptations for the

561
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,080
various devices using the network stack

562
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,600
this spreads very easily

563
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,720
this affects real-time operating systems

564
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,840
that are used in countless critical

565
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,480
infrastructure and manufacturing devices

566
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,159
and settings

567
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
you'll probably recognize almost all of

568
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,120
those labels

569
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,039
in an example of an attack

570
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,120
vxworks devices are at the perimeter of

571
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,840
the network

572
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,360
firewalls now you would expect these

573
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
devices to be designed to fight off

574
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,120
incoming attacks

575
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
and they should be secure

576
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,240
however

577
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
an attacker could take over the

578
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,960
sonicwall file raw on the perimeter

579
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,080
via the urgent 11 flaws and an internet

580
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,000
connection

581
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
using a specially crafted tcp packet and

582
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,679
then take over all the firewalls to

583
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,840
build a botnet

584
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,400
now this might sound pretty extreme

585
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
so i've put the url up on the bottom so

586
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,480
that you can watch armis's video of the

587
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,440
proof of concept

588
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
ripple 20

589
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
june of 2020 now this was named for the

590
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,640
ripple effect of one vulnerable

591
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
component spreading out to impact

592
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,799
countless more

593
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,600
these are 19 vulnerabilities that impact

594
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,320
the

595
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
tcp ip library known as trek which was

596
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,120
developed in 1997

597
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,000
and that is in the base of many iot

598
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,039
products

599
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,200
it enables devices or software to

600
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,360
connect to the internet via tcp ip

601
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,600
connections

602
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,760
there are six critical vulnerabilities

603
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,279
that can enable remote code execution

604
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,080
and this impacts hundreds of millions of

605
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,520
things

606
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,880
we're talking smart home devices routers

607
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,039
communications equipment used for mobile

608
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,400
and satellites

609
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,840
or data center equipment

610
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
and this is found in

611
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
health care systems

612
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,919
transportation systems and power grids

613
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
in an attack

614
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,480
they could

615
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,080
steal information from a printer

616
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,320
mess with an infusion pump

617
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,480
hamper industrial control devices

618
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,679
an attacker could hide malicious code

619
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,440
within embedded devices for years

620
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,039
and one of the vulnerabilities could

621
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,360
enable entry from outside into the

622
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
network boundaries

623
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,520
yes

624
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,360
amnesia 33 from december of 2020

625
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,039
this was discovered

626
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,720
by forescout while they were doing

627
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,679
research on project memoria

628
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,520
they were doing project memorial because

629
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
of what had been revealed about

630
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,400
vulnerabilities

631
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
in the ipnet and tcpip stacks from

632
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,480
urgent 11 and ripple 20. so i want to

633
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,880
call out the importance of this research

634
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,159
and give a big thanks

635
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,640
there were 33 vulnerabilities

636
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
that impact firmware identified

637
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,720
and this affects four open source tcp ip

638
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,159
libraries

639
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
the affected libraries were added to

640
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
device firmware to allow products to

641
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
support tcp

642
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,559
which is the current most widely used

643
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,320
networking communications protocol

644
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,120
now

645
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
there were four critical memory

646
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,240
corruption flaws

647
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,640
and that poses a greater risk to our

648
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,880
work from homeworld because while the

649
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,679
endpoint is easier to compromise

650
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,080
this then increases the risk that

651
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,120
unmanaged home routers could compromise

652
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,679
vpn protected networks

653
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,240
and potentially gain access

654
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,279
to the corporation

655
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,600
if exploited an attacker could

656
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,399
among other things perform

657
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,640
remote code execution to take control of

658
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,960
a target device

659
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,720
denial of service to impair

660
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
functionality and impact business

661
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
operations

662
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,320
there could be an information leak and

663
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,480
acquire potentially sensitive

664
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
information

665
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,880
there could be dns

666
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,600
cache poisoning attacks which point a

667
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,439
device to a malicious website

668
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,960
and that brings us to number jack

669
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,320
from february of this year

670
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,600
number jack adds seven more vulnerable

671
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,440
tcp ip stacks to the four open tcp ip

672
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,679
stacks that were identified in amnesia

673
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,120
33

674
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,520
increasing the vulnerable devices by

675
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,440
millions

676
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,559
in february of 2021 forescout reported

677
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,679
on vulnerabilities in multiple tcp ip

678
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,080
stacks that impact the generation of

679
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,120
initial sequence numbers or isn's

680
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,360
now this is a 32-bit number used in

681
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,679
establishing new sessions within tcp

682
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,039
connections

683
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,159
and to illustrate in a similar concept

684
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,240
let me take a moment and remember the

685
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,720
legendary work done by the late great

686
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,480
dan kaminsky

687
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,799
he identified that initial sequence

688
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,039
numbers were not sufficiently randomized

689
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,320
in dns queries back in 2008 and

690
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,399
effectively prevented

691
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,200
a major situation

692
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
essentially saving the world it's a

693
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,120
great story and you should read about it

694
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,880
so isn't must be randomly generated to

695
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,200
ensure that tcp connections between

696
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,120
devices are unique

697
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,360
that there are no collisions

698
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,440
and to prevent a third party from

699
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,760
interfering with an existing connection

700
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,799
because if an attacker can guess an ism

701
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,120
they can potentially hijack an ongoing

702
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,799
connection or spoof a new one

703
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,720
and these vulnerabilities may not be as

704
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
critical as those identified in amnesia

705
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
33

706
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,799
but they're easier for attackers to

707
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,000
identify and more likely to be exploited

708
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,399
leading to a denial of service attack

709
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,399
authentication bypass

710
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,239
or malicious code injection

711
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,600
the popularity in some use cases of the

712
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,080
vulnerable stacks is extensive

713
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
because these are used by millions of

714
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
devices and include everything from file

715
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,000
servers to embedded components

716
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,640
identification is a challenge because

717
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,360
you don't often know what stack a device

718
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,799
is running

719
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,360
and as you'll hear me say repeatedly in

720
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
this talk embedded devices are very

721
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,480
difficult to manage and update

722
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
the vulnerabilities were discovered and

723
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,960
disclosed to the manufacturers in

724
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,399
october of 2020.

725
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,120
now

726
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,760
in a possible attack the attacker would

727
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,720
impersonate a legitimate client and open

728
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
a connection to a server using a

729
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,679
deterministic isn generator

730
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,600
the server would think that the sim

731
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,320
packet is coming from a client and then

732
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,440
send a synap packet to the client which

733
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
includes the isn

734
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,000
now the attacker can't see the synag

735
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,559
packet sent to the client but

736
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,320
if they're able to guess the value of

737
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,519
isn

738
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,840
then they can still send an app packet

739
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,279
back to the server with the guest is n

740
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,440
used by the server and complete the

741
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,360
three-way handshake

742
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,120
and so the server thinks it has a

743
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,519
legitimate connection with the client

744
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,840
when it's really communicating with the

745
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,840
attacker

746
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,120

systems in the bsd family

758
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,399
there's ipnet vulnerable version vxwork

759
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,600

million devices

777
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,880
now there are a number of bugs that

778
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,000
could be combined for serious impact

779
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,159
attacks could involve stealing sensitive

780
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,519
data or modifying or taking equipment

781
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,559
offline for sabotage purposes

782
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,880
attackers could cause serious damage to

783
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
government or enterprise servers to

784
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,159
healthcare facilities retailers or

785
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,039
companies in the manufacturing business

786
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,200
they could also tamper with critical

787
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,440
building functions in residential or

788
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,919
commercial locations to control the

789
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,600
heating and ventilation

790
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,480
to disable security systems or to tamper

791
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,559
with automated lighting systems

792
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,519
realtek from april of this year

793
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,320

sdk security flaws in their rtl 819 xd

796
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,960
chipsets affect wi-fi devices

797
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
a lot of wi-fi devices

798
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,440
these are used by over 65 iot device

799
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,960
manufacturers

800
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,918
200 iot product lines

801
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:22,879
and

802
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,040
hundreds hundreds of thousands of

803
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,839
devices there's routers cameras and a

804
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,159
whole lot more

805
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,040
this involves four vulnerabilities

806
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,839
there's a stack buffer overflow via

807
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,760
universal plug-and-play

808
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,639
a heat-based buffer overflow

809
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,879
a command injection

810
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,440
and saving the best for last

811
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,760
there are multiple vulnerabilities in

812
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,560
the web management interface

813
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,960
which has the most serious one

814
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,918
via forms this command a remote

815
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,560
unauthenticated attacker could execute

816
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,240
arbitrary command

817
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,839
at the highest level of privilege

818
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,919
so

819
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,359
if we wanted to look at an attack here

820
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,440
an attacker could gain control of a

821
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,960
wireless router for full compromise

822
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,400
and

823
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,480
as per the quotation given that wireless

824
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,560
routers are a central node for many

825
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,160
devices

826
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,079
well the compromise here would spell

827
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,760
disaster for

828
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,000
all of those other devices connected via

829
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,680
the home

830
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,118
or workplace networks

arcadian

832
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,480
from august of this year

833
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,200
you probably haven't heard of it but now

834
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,440
you will arcadian firmware is found in

835
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,320
many

836
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
soho or small office home office routers

837
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,320
notably the buffalo brand

838
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,079
cve 2021 20090

839
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,560
existed in arcadian's firmware for at

840
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,680
least 10 years

841
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,040
it is a path traversal vulnerability

842
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
discovered by tenable researchers which

843
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,040
leads to an authentication bypass and

844
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
when exploited

845
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
the attacker can take over control of

846
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,920
the affected device

847
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,960
in the vulnerability is described by

848
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,960
tenable as trivial to exploit

849
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,680
that means that every vendor who's used

850
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,839
it in their models has automatically

851
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,920
inherited the bug

852
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,359
it affects millions of devices from 20

853
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,000
vendors including internet service

854
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,280
providers

855
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,440
now it was first identified in those

856
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,960
buffalo routers

857
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,359
but it's been seen in routers supplied

858
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,560
by isps such as british telecom

859
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,280
and deutsche telecom to their customers

860
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,440
and includes brands such as asus

861
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,119
now according to tenable the

862
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,000
vulnerability exists due to a list of

863
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,720
folders which falls under a bypass list

864
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,560
for authentication

865
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,960
for most of the devices that are listed

866
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,880
that means that the vulnerability could

867
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,440
be triggered in multiple ways

868
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
and the devices impacted by the

869
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
vulnerable arcadian code could be

870
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,480
leveraged to access other devices

871
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,560
on a home or corporate network

872
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,440
or manipulate dns records to serve users

873
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,000
up with some malicious content

874
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,839
even

875
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:34,160
without an additional vulnerability to

876
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,520
grant root access there were a series of

877
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,560
attacks

878
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,160
earlier this year

879
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,800
spreading from february then again in

880
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,680
june and july and then again in august

881
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,560
which were targeting vulnerable routers

882
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,400
to deploy a mirai botnet variant

883
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,119
and security researchers have warned

884
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,240
that

885
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
given that most people may not even be

886
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,119
aware of the security risk

887
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,960
and they won't be upgrading their device

888
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
anytime soon

889
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,720
this attack tactic can be very

890
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,240
successful

891
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,160
cheap and easy to carry out

892
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,000
here is

893
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,440
then embedded in their systems

894
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,200
distribute it

895
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,320
and get sold to customers globally

896
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,359
technical calls

897
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,760
vulnerability present for a decade

898
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,560
citing quote

899
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,880
track and fix due to the number of

900
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
vendors involved

901
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,200
furthermore with each new vendor found

902
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,760
to be downstream of the vulnerable link

903
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,520
in the supply chain

904
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,280
the attack surface

905
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,560
area increases exponentially

906
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,240
and then there's through tech

907
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,359
there was a lot going on this august

908
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,839
misomi networks announced the discovery

909
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,839
and disclosure of a vulnerability in

910
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,079
security cameras from a software

911
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,440
component supplied by through tech

912
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
this was identified as a critical

913
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,880
vulnerability

914
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,720
an improper access control flaw

915
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
the kla peer-to-peer software

916
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,040
development kit provides remote access

917
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,680
to audio and video streams online

918
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,160
it's built into client software and

919
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,400
networked iot devices there are

920
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,680
potentially

921
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,720
83 million of them

922
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,520
so that makes it hard to actually trace

923
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,640
back because

924
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,200
software supply chain issues

925
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,040
and this was part of the supply chain

926
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,680
for many oems or original equipment

927
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,640
manufacturers for security cameras and

928
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,119
iot devices

929
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,760
and the risks of vulnerable cameras are

930
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
unauthorized access to confidential

931
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,119
audio and video camera feeds which could

932
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,160
reveal

933
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,040
sensitive data

934
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,520
in this case the attack is

935
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
unauthorized access to remotely

936
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,240
compromise the device and then watch

937
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,880
real-time video data or listen to live

938
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,920
audio and potentially access sensitive

939
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,319
data

940
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,720
in another

941
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,040
attack this will show how a remote

942
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,319
attacker could gain unauthorized access

943
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,119
and then get the device credentials to

944
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,000
be used in further attacks

945
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,880
for more control

946
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,839
then in september

947
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,480
we had bracktooth

948
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,920
16 vulnerabilities across 13 bluetooth

949
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
chipsets

950
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,200
and these were discovered by the

951
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,040
automated systems security research

952
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,839
group of singapore

953
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,760
1400 products from 11 vendors

954
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,680
including intel

955
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,800
qualcomm

956
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,359
and texas instruments

957
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,440
the most severe of these was identified

958
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
as cve

959
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,319
2021

960
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,319
28139

961
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:43,119
it affects the esp32 system on chip

962
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,839
widely used in many bluetooth based

963
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,359
appliances

964
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,960
it's cheap

965
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,400
low power

966
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,560
bluetooth and wi-fi

967
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,319
and it's everywhere

968
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,119
no previous pairing or authentication

969
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,520
required

970
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,480
the impact is either a crash or a

971
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,000
deadlock

972
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,520
now

973
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,800
there have been some other

974
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
vulnerabilities impacting the bluetooth

975
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,000
protocol and its implementations

976
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,280
over the past two years and they include

977
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,520
blur tooth

978
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,800
knob

979
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,560
bias

980
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,240
blasa

981
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,959
and swain tooth

982
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
in an attack

983
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,079
due to the lack of out-of-bounds check

984
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,960
in the library an attacker could inject

985
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,800
arbitrary code

986
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,040
on a vulnerable device and erase the

987
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,599
nvram data

988
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,400
any of the attacks could be done using a

989
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,160
fifteen dollar bluetooth usb radio kit

990
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,759
shown in the examples

991
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,480
now the researchers tested products from

992
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,880
11 vendors and gave them over 90 days

993
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,960
warning but not all the vendors got

994
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,599
patches out in that time as of september

995
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,800
the first

996
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,319
espressif systems infineon and blue trim

997
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,599
released patches texas instruments

998
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,960
said no

999
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,359
the researchers won't release a proof of

1000
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,920
concept to reproduce the attacks but

1001
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,160
they have a web form where vendors can

1002
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,319
contact them and then get code to test

1003
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,800
for themselves i've put the url on the

1004
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,680
slide at the bottom

1005
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
so

1006
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,160
what have we learned

1007
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,240
we've learned about a series of

1008
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,640
widespread vulnerabilities related to

1009
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,359
tcp ip stacks

1010
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,680
and that the flaws in these stacks are

1011
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,079
inherited in software used in embedded

1012
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,720
devices

1013
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,680
that there is a real problem of

1014
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,440
identification

1015
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,960
how do you know if it's in your device

1016
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,400
that embedded devices are difficult

1017
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,680
to manage and update

1018
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,680
and yes attackers are actively searching

1019
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,880
for vulnerable unpatched devices to

1020
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,440
exploit

1021
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,240
so what can we do about this

1022
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,200
well

1023
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,119
there's some good news

1024
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,200
there's some progress that's been made

1025
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,319
in january of 2020 the california iot

1026
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,280
cyber security improvement act from 2017

1027
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,800
took effect

1028
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,720
they were the first state to adopt an

1029
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,000
iot law oregon followed soon after with

1030
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,359
their own bill

1031
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,599
now manufacturers of iot devices are

1032
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,720
required to equip any ioto device that

1033
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,119
they make with a reasonable security

1034
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,079
feature appropriate to that device

1035
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,400
the information that it may collect

1036
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,200
hold or send and to protect the device

1037
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,079
and information on it from unauthorized

1038
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,040
access

1039
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,079
destruction use modification or

1040
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,520
disclosure

1041
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,000
in december of 2020 president trump

1042
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,560
signed into law the iot cyber security

1043
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,800
improvement act and this provides the

1044
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,079
first federal standards for this area

1045
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,319
nist was mandated to develop minimum

1046
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,720
cyber security standards for any

1047
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,560
internet connected device sold by

1048
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
vendors to the us government

1049
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,599
and iot vendors to create vulnerability

1050
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,400
disclosure policies to promptly inform

1051
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,880
we need to put some rules in place

1052
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,040
we need to automate the identification

1053
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
of iot devices so that we don't have to

1054
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,319
play hide and seek anymore

1055
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,800
we should use device classification to

1056
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,480
understand how

1057
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,720
where and why they are used and then

1058
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,640
know how they can be manipulated

1059
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,680
you can use frameworks from nist and cis

1060
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,440
to enforce them

1061
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,760
for unmanaged devices in iot

1062
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,839
we need to have iot policies and

1063
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,440
compliance functions

1064
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
and we need to design with security from

1065
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,560
the beginning it ot need to work

1066
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,040
together on this with clear roles to

1067
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,280
manage applications systems

1068
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,160
infrastructure and data

1069
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,319
we need to have a mature software

1070
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,720
defined life cycle

1071
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,040
and have security champions

1072
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,839
involve the code developers

1073
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,079
build standards and baselines and

1074
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,560
eliminate special snowflakes

1075
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,520
and leverage the power of the bomb

1076
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,680
the bill of materials have builds of

1077
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,040
materials for all the things

1078
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,359
and this

1079
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,400
please

1080
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
because you don't know what you've got

1081
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,200
till it's pwned

1082
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,160
so what can you do here are some

1083
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,920
suggestions

1084
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,560
know your attack surface

1085
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,319
use multi-factor authentication

1086
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,440
segment your network

1087
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,160
keep your firewalls and your vpns up to

1088
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,480
date

1089
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,680
automation is your friend

1090
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,680
have centralized access logs

1091
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,720
use behavioral monitoring to check for

1092
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,359
anomalies

1093
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,400
zero trust

1094
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,359
and as a final takeaway

1095
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,839
spend some time and money because a

1096
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,720
culture shift is needed we need to break

1097
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,319
down the silos within and between i.t

1098
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,520
security

1099
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,440
and other departments to ensure

1100
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,760
visibility and understanding

1101
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,920
our shared goal should be this

1102
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
building a cyber security strategy

1103
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,000
across departments and functions

1104
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,079
let me reference the movie irobot

1105
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,480
in a society that embraced handing over

1106
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,160
tasks to tech

1107
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,520
things were good

1108
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,119
until they weren't

1109
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,040
which about sums up what it's like when

1110
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,359
iot infiltrates enterprise

1111
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,359
these devices are not the obedient

1112
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,200
little soldiers that computers and

1113
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,960
laptops are

1114
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,040
these interact differently with the

1115
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,480
existing network they behave differently

1116
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,079
they operate with

1117
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,599
little to no human intervention

1118
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,079
automating convenience with inadequate

1119
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,440
supervision is going to end badly

1120
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,839
just saying

1121
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,440
and with that

1122
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,319
thank you so much for your time and for

1123
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,520
attending my talk i hope it was helpful

1124
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,920
and if you have got any questions please

1125
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,319
feel free to contact me here

1126
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,359
thank you so very very much

1127
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,240
you
