1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,159
hey everyone my name is eric escobar and

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,520
today i'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,440
wireless networks from the offensive

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,879
side and the defensive side

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,880
so you want to hack some wi-fi as you

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,240
can see in the corner here these are the

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,719
boxes that we use to remotely test our

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,800
clients wireless networks uh but before

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
i get into any of that one quick thing i

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,400
want to throw out there is that imposter

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
syndrome is real

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,279
um and so this talk is gonna be

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,720
authentic you're gonna get the um's the

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,439
us nobody is perfect and i think it's

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
always an important thing to say um when

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,359
you're talking to the security community

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,120
um that if you're a noob and you don't

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,079
really know what you're doing or you

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,000
don't think that you do um everybody

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,760
feels that way i definitely feel still

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,200
feel that way so

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,360
um yeah with that i'll get on with the

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,079
rest of this talk

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
so a lot of our clients they do what's

25
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,840
called external penetration testing

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,360
internal penetration testing and

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,079
application tests basically uh external

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,760
tests you can think of are that is

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,239
testing somebody's external network like

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,920
you're coming in from the public

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
internet right uh the internal

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,359
penetration test is maybe like a threat

33
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,920
actor in your network already simulating

34
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
uh maybe a malicious link that was

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,760
clicked or rogue employee

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
and then your application test if your

37
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,320
company has a specific web application

38
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,760
or form

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,439
or you know maybe a mobile application

40
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,119
that they use um these are the three

41
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
main tests that most clients get they

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,439
get these three um you know just

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,119
out-of-the-box tests because that's what

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,040
they think their their whole network

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
covers and encompasses and a lot of the

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
times they leave out wireless testing

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,479
they think you know what maybe we can

48
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
just skip it um you know they think hey

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
you know it's not quite in the budget so

50
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,960
let's just leave it right um and i hope

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,640
to change some minds and change some

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
hearts here so um without that without

53
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
further ado let's let's get into the the

54
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
meat of it

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
so i'm going to be talking about this

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
from an adversarial perspective um and

57
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,000
then also a defensive one but first

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,159
adversarial because um that's what i do

59
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
i'm on adversary group team it's secure

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
work security group we call yourself

61
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
swag

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,240
um and uh and so it's it's interesting i

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
think even from a blue team perspective

64
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,200
or somebody who's defending the

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
network's perspective um whether it's

66
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
for a corporate network or even just for

67
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,440
your home to think to know how a threat

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
actor you know thinks and you know the

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,800
things that they see when they go into a

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,239
building or or you know when they're

71
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,840
trying to target you know you or your

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,879
company

73
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,160
um and really a wireless network is just

74
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
an extension of typically your corporate

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
network it's typically not much

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,879
different

77
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
you know end users have to have laptops

78
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
they have to have devices that connect

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
into all other resources and internal

80
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,879
applications

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
and what's awesome for me is that

82
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
your wireless network typically extends

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
faster building and especially if you

84
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
have you know a yogi antenna or edition

85
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,959
antenna or some directional antenna that

86
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,959
um increases the gain in such a way that

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,040
that i can access your wi-fi from a long

88
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
ways away um so if you look at this

89
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
picture here you can see hey this might

90
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,959
just be me on a park bench um you know

91
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
sitting outside this car dealership uh

92
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,120
trying to get out their wi-fi um now the

93
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
best part about this is that there's no

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,239
cameras that are gonna pick me up

95
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
there's no badges i have to like try and

96
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
clone and get past

97
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
um i don't need you know full access to

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
the inside of you know of your facility

99
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
you know ethernet ports usb ports

100
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,800
computers i don't i don't need any of

101
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
that um and typically with our clients a

102
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,920
lot of the logging that they do is is

103
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,280
focused on their firewalls and their

104
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,879
perimeter and rightly so those are

105
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,879
really important things to look at but

106
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
that leaves a big security gap a big gap

107
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
there that somebody like myself can take

108
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,200
advantage of um and the other thing

109
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
that's interesting too is that whips and

110
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
widths are typically not monitored and

111
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,239
if if you're not familiar with what that

112
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
vernacular is wips stands for wireless

113
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
intrusion prevention and widths is

114
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
wireless intrusion detection so you're

115
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,040
probably more familiar with ips and ids

116
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
if you're coming from a network you know

117
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
understanding standpoint basically what

118
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,200
what those tools do or what the parts of

119
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
those applications do is they sit on top

120
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
of your wireless controller and they

121
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
look at um all the wireless traffic

122
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,879
that's being generated and they and they

123
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,360
detect anomalies in the you know in the

124
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
form of the ids

125
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
or they prevent them if it's an active

126
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,439
you know actively attacking situation

127
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,560
there's some good tools out there on the

128
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
market but what's interesting is that um

129
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
i very seldom see them monitored i very

130
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,799
seldom see them you know even even pick

131
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,799
something up um i declined a few weeks

132
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,478
ago that uh

133
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,079
you know i had a rogue access point i

134
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
got a whole bunch of end users

135
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
credentials and i there was a finding in

136
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,720
the report that said hey you know

137
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
intrusion um prevention or intrusion

138
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
detection um set up and they go what do

139
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
you mean like we have it logged like

140
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
look i can go pull up the logs and show

141
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
you know the mac addresses of those you

142
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
know rogue access points um

143
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
and i said yeah but you never you never

144
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
notified me you had to go back through

145
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
and look at it and so that's that's not

146
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,479
active that's you know i already had the

147
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
keys that the kingdom was out the door

148
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
before you knew that anything was

149
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
actually happening and so it's one of

150
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
those things that that's the perfect

151
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,040
spot for an adversary that's the perfect

152
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,680
spot for a threat actor is to be in a

153
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,520
place where it's not heavily monitored

154
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
to where you can still gain access to a

155
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,479
lot of stuff um and you know it's not

156
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,080
something that that's in full focus

157
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
right it's you're going through the side

158
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,600
door versus you know trying to cross the

159
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
moat so to say

160
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
um and so like there's there's a lot of

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
benefits to being a wireless adversary

162
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,720
to being a wireless attacker like like i

163
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
said before it's really easy to stay

164
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
anonymous um i can stay at a site and

165
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
the other thing is too is that if i like

166
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
open up documents or access credentials

167
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,199
or do something like that i don't have

168
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,720
to worry about exfiltrating that from

169
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
your network i don't have to worry about

170
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
trying to get that data off you know to

171
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
some you know command and control

172
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
infrastructure because it's all on my

173
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,919
device that's most likely in my pocket

174
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
or in my backpack um i also don't need

175
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
any of that internal access to you know

176
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
to take a poke at your your wireless um

177
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
this is something that i used to use a

178
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,479
while ago um right now this is more

179
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,039
upgraded but basically this is just um

180
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,560
you know five volt battery you know

181
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
rechargeable battery a raspberry pi and

182
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
then a wireless adapter um since then

183
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
this this kit has been upgraded pretty

184
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,479
heavily you know now it's pi4's now it's

185
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,199
pandas that can do both 2.4 gigahertz

186
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
and 5.8 gigahertz frequencies um the

187
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,800
battery's even a little bit bigger and

188
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
i'll show you that um in the next couple

189
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
slides but really just something this

190
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,360
simple dollars worth of gear off amazon

191
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
is all that it takes um you know to

192
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,080
fully compromise somebody's network to

193
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,880
you know

194
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,919
um

195
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
it's not expensive at all i took a setup

196
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
almost identical to this um to a large

197
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
company sat in their cafeteria and as

198
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,319
all of their you know researchers and

199
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,840
scientists came and sat down in the

200
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
cafeteria for lunch i was collecting

201
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
credentials left and right um and it was

202
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
just one of those things that it was

203
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
kind of unbelievable that you know a

204
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
company that has hundreds and if not

205
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
billions of dollars to spend on on

206
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
security and i.t um you know could be

207
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,520
brought down or at least maybe not

208
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
brought down but have uh credentials

209
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,199
stolen and information stolen with just

210
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
a hundred dollars and a little bit of

211
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
know-how um so again thinking like an

212
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,199
adversary thinking about like hey you

213
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
know you don't need all the you know all

214
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,199
these really fancy gadgets when um some

215
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
just off the shelf stuff from amazon uh

216
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,840
and again youtube videos to learn how it

217
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,240
all works um you know is all you really

218
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,280
need

219
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
and so the other nice part about this is

220
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,919
that um you can stand up a a

221
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
an access point in your pocket that you

222
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,680
can then use your phone to connect back

223
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
to or you could just have a hot spot in

224
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,319
your pocket

225
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,479
and use that as kind of like your your

226
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,639
go between for this information and so i

227
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
have i use an app on my phone called

228
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,479
terminus and what this app does is it

229
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
basically just emulates you know an ssh

230
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
or ftp connection um

231
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
and or telnet connection and so you can

232
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,479
basically

233
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,360
access your device um over ssh you know

234
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
the raspberry pi over ssh and do a full

235
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,400
control of it um and so again this is

236
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,840
easier to stay anonymous because now i'm

237
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
not a dude with a laptop now i'm just

238
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,919
you know a dude with a phone just like

239
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
everybody else only now i have access to

240
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
a full you know a full operating system

241
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,680
that's just living in my pocket um again

242
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
i can stay at a site there doesn't have

243
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,000
to be any antennas visible um and yeah

244
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
there's there's no there's no actual

245
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,840
access that's required i can just walk

246
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,599
right through a public area where i know

247
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,199
a lot of your employees are

248
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,879
and capture a lot of information off of

249
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,720
it and again this is just a screenshot

250
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
of what my phone looks like during an

251
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
engagement

252
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
so this is

253
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
my friend matt's backpack that we use on

254
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
some of his engagements um and as you

255
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
can see if you look at this you know

256
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,639
yeah there's some 3d printed stuff on

257
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,240
the side of it but really if you were

258
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,759
just walking through a crowd

259
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
and he had that that alpha antenna

260
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,039
turned the other way to where it was

261
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
just all black you really wouldn't

262
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
notice a whole lot there um right like

263
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,639
you wouldn't really wouldn't really

264
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,640
stick out and you probably when you look

265
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,159
at this you're probably only looking at

266
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,000
the the little green bits of 3d printed

267
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
alpha antenna that you can see right

268
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
there and right there and maybe the gold

269
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,958
bits but what you probably also don't

270
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,000
see is this 90 b antenna um threaded

271
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,279
right through there

272
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,800
and then this panda right here that's

273
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
underneath it so even though what might

274
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,120
stick out initially is two antennas

275
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
really what you have or two wireless

276
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,959
adapters you actually have four wireless

277
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,040
adapters just on this backpack just on

278
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
the outside and again if you wanted to

279
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
go super stealth you could just put that

280
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,920
directly in your backpack and no one

281
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
would be the wiser

282
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,839
this is what it looks like when you open

283
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
it up on the inside um it's basically

284
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,839
just two ten thousand milliamp hour

285
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,279
batteries hooked up to some raspberry

286
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,600
pi's um that do all the the controlling

287
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
and have the actual adapters on board

288
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,279
and that's that's all that's right here

289
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,800
right again maybe just a couple hundred

290
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
dollars like honestly the backpack is

291
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
probably the most expensive thing out of

292
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,160
that entire uh kit you know not not even

293
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,399
the electronics involved um but that's

294
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,839
that's how an adversary thinks this is

295
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,279
how an adversary you know would just

296
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,200
walk through your building or

297
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,399
potentially just walk through your

298
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,320
parking lot um collecting all this

299
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
information and to to you just hate some

300
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
individual with a backpack um it doesn't

301
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,839
have to be a backpack could be a

302
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,440
briefcase it could just be anything

303
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,680
honestly i've i've put uh you know

304
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,080
wireless adapters in in just coffee cups

305
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,000
you know right like a little like cheap

306
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,640
uh plastic coffee cup um you know i've

307
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
even thrown i've even thrown a raspberry

308
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
pi away in a trash can uh and then come

309
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
back and retrieve it or if i wanted to i

310
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
guess i could have had you know the

311
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
janitorial service would have thrown it

312
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
out and gotten rid of um you know all of

313
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,279
that for me kind of expense is not

314
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,560
something i would want to do but if

315
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
you're a nation state or if you're an

316
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
adversary with some deep pockets um you

317
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
wouldn't blink twice at you know the

318
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
data that you could compromise um with

319
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,399
just a hundred dollars if that were only

320
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,839
a one-time use sort of

321
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,240
thing um and so all that to say you know

322
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
now so that that's adversary you know

323
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,920
that's my adversary hat on of just like

324
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,279
what does this look like what what could

325
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,560
somebody bad do what do they you know

326
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,079
what do they think like and that's not

327
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
always super helpful when there's not um

328
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
you know there's not something that can

329
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
be really done about it and really all

330
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
that comes back to is is monitoring your

331
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
access points right you know use good

332
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,000
passwords if you have a pre-shared key

333
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
network if you have wpa2 psk um but

334
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
other than that if you monitor for rogue

335
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,000
access points if you have any type of

336
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
enterprise network that'll go so far to

337
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
at least you know knowing that hey

338
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,079
something is going on um so i've

339
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,760
mentioned it a couple of times offhand

340
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,279
rogue access point

341
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,120
all a rogue access point is is just an

342
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,839
access point that you don't control

343
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,760
now technically this means that any

344
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
access point is a rogue access point

345
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
right so

346
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,880
if somebody has a

347
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
somebody has like a little hotspot or if

348
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,839
somebody has

349
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
a router that they plug in you know from

350
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,800
home

351
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,959
those are all technically rogue access

352
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
points uh but the hard part is then

353
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
distinguishing you know what what rogue

354
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,760
access points are actually dangerous

355
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,959
what um

356
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
you know which ones do you discern do

357
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
you do you alert on every access point

358
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
that is rogue now if if you are in like

359
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
say a shared workspace that's going to

360
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,360
be really hard you're going to get a ton

361
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
of alerts and that's why a lot of our

362
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,200
clients ignore alerts that come from

363
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,560
rogue access point detection because

364
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,200
they're detecting off of every single

365
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
other access point that they don't home

366
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,959
that's within their airspace um and

367
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,000
again in a crowded area that could be a

368
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
thousands of alerts you know a minute um

369
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
however you know maybe the ones that you

370
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
only care about are access points that

371
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,839
are designed to trick your end users

372
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
into connecting to them or maybe they're

373
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
designed into coercing credentials out

374
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,680
of them

375
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
and and maybe that is done in such a way

376
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
that you know it looks similar to what

377
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
your wi-fi looks like

378
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
so i'll take you on a quick example of

379
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,120
how i do what i do

380
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
um so this is a tool that i've used in

381
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
the past called wi-fi fisher all it does

382
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,760
is this kicks up a captive portal you

383
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
know not dissimilar to if you've ever

384
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
stayed at a hotel got on an airplane or

385
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
used any public wi-fi where you know

386
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
something will pop up in front of your

387
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,639
face and says hey you know you need to

388
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,240
click agree or you need to type in a

389
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
passcode or you need to do something um

390
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,639
well i you know attackers like myself

391
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
can utilize basically that same same

392
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,639
technology that same feature set um to

393
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,079
coerce end users into providing

394
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,320
credentials and so you can see that uh

395
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
what this tool does is it will kick

396
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
somebody off of the good wireless

397
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,800
network the one that they're supposed to

398
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
be connected to

399
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,040
and then it will then coerce the end

400
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
user into connecting to mine because it

401
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
has a higher signal strength um you know

402
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
and it and it appears like hey this is

403
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,639
going to be potentially a faster

404
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,399
connection right

405
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,279
um

406
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,240
and so

407
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,920
what will pop up on their phone is you

408
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,600
can see the up top the microsoft you

409
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,399
know uh redirect you know some similar

410
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,079
to like the apple captive portal or

411
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,600
anything on your phone

412
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
and what this application does is it

413
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,720
looks at the user agent looks at the

414
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,880
device that that's connecting to it and

415
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
it says hey if this is an iphone i'm

416
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,240
going to present a different prompt but

417
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,839
if i were to connect to it on a windows

418
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,320
10 device um it's going to pop up the

419
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,240
screen that says oh no android internet

420
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
connection you need to enter in your

421
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,920
network security key

422
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
now if you're a seasoned security

423
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
individual you're probably not you're

424
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,079
probably going to see past this right

425
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
you're probably going to see oh you know

426
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
whatever you know you type in the

427
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
security key here you know and and this

428
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
is all just you know based on on the

429
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,399
browser it's not actually popping up

430
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,600
from the menu

431
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,199
but if you don't have a sophisticated

432
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
user if you don't have somebody who

433
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,720
knows to look for for something like

434
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,920
this or um you know or we all have

435
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,120
individuals in our lives that just

436
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,199
blindly click on things and emails that

437
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,279
you really wish they wouldn't have

438
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,800
and if they were to do this and enter in

439
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,399
that network security key or you know

440
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,399
your passphrase that's all that somebody

441
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
like me is an attacker needs to then

442
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
access your network um remotely to

443
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,959
access your network from that park bench

444
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,000
uh getting into you know your your your

445
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
company um and so just just something

446
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
this simple um you know it seems like oh

447
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
that was really easy like um you know i

448
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,600
can't believe somebody would be fooled

449
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
by it but it happens all the time and it

450
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,680
works all the time if it works attackers

451
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,240
are going to keep doing it um

452
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
but in order to carry out this attack i

453
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
needed to stand up my own access point

454
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
that i control as an attacker and so as

455
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
a defender what you can then do is

456
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,480
basically have um detection in place you

457
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
know if you're using aruba if you're

458
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
using cisco if you're using ubiquity all

459
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,079
of these platforms have their own

460
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,519
version of

461
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,040
intrusion detection or intrusion

462
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,839
prevention that look for these rogue

463
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,920
for these rogue access points that that

464
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
could do this sort of attack

465
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,800
um and when i say rogue access points a

466
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
lot of times people just think oh they

467
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,480
cloned you know the same wi-fi name so

468
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,079
say say your home wi-fi is you know uh

469
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,880
eric123 right um if if i were going to

470
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
try and compromise you i might make an

471
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,440
exact same ssid that is eric123 um and

472
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
and i kind of have this chart that i use

473
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,160
in our engagements that shows um

474
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,680
the difficulty of different rogue access

475
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,160
points so you have the ssid so ssid is

476
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
just what you see when you like connect

477
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
to it on your phone that's you know your

478
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
home wi-fi name then the mac address is

479
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,000
actually the hardware address of of like

480
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,399
that access point and that's important

481
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,199
um

482
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
because that's how all these devices you

483
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,959
know know to connect to each other it's

484
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,160
it's basically their physical address

485
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
like your house address and they need to

486
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,959
know where to deliver the mail to the

487
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,160
packets to

488
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,480
um and so uh you know something that's

489
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
super easy is throw up an obvious mac

490
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
address like zero zero one one two two

491
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,160
three three because that's not a real

492
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
mac address of anything out there and

493
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,839
that probably doesn't match um you know

494
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,839
the normal address scheme of whatever

495
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,600
wireless access points your company or

496
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,759
your house run um so that's a pretty

497
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,120
easy one to catch you know honestly a

498
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,199
person just scrolling through the logs

499
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,480
can most likely

500
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,519
could most likely catch that

501
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,199
but then you will have okay an exact

502
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,880
match and maybe a random mac address you

503
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,839
know so that's not something that

504
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,360
somebody could just pick out of the logs

505
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
by by looking at it um what happens if i

506
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,759
have an exact match of of your ssid and

507
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,920
then similar to known access points so

508
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,240
hey maybe this access point belonged to

509
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,360
a different group or a different

510
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
controller and you know maybe it's maybe

511
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,639
it's totally fine it looks like it

512
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,560
belongs harder to pick out with the eyes

513
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
right if you're just somebody that's

514
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,519
scrolling through logs um so we're

515
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,120
getting in the more difficult of this

516
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,680
section um so now what happens if you

517
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,040
have a

518
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,120
company that has multiple branches um

519
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
and you cloned a mac address from one

520
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,079
site to another site so from

521
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
branch a to brain branch b

522
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,519
is your controller going to be able to

523
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,839
distinguish hey which of the you know

524
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,199
which of these sites is mac address

525
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,880
coming from is it actually bad

526
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,040
um then what happens if i do it from the

527
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
same site so say you have a large like

528
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,800
warehouse like a costco and there's an

529
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
access point on one side of the costco

530
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,920
and the access point on the other side

531
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,319
of the costco if i clone one you know if

532
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,000
i if i know what one mac address is

533
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,439
standard baroque access point on the

534
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,359
complete opposite side of that costco

535
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,359
with that other rogue access point will

536
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,640
your wireless controller be able to

537
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
distinguish hey that there is a

538
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
geographical distance between these two

539
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
um again like we're just going down the

540
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
difficulty scale i don't have to go all

541
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
the way down to the craziness of like

542
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,760
you know not an exact ssid um and that

543
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,360
sort of thing but these are the ways

544
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
that attacker like myself thinks

545
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
but really the low-hanging fruit is if

546
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,160
you can just detect you know when when a

547
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
random you know access point comes up

548
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
that matches your exact ssid you're

549
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,120
going to cover 95 percent of all

550
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
attackers that are ever going to look at

551
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
your network um and so just it's one of

552
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
those things that i'm looking at this as

553
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,320
an adversary i'm looking at this as

554
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,679
somebody who's trying to defend their

555
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,840
network and you know you're never going

556
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
to get 100 coverage for absolutely

557
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
everything but 95 is pretty good

558
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
especially for the tools that are out

559
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,320
there and how long they take to

560
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
configure and ensure you have to tune

561
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,520
them a little bit but that's like every

562
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,600
tool um the goal of this talk is really

563
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
just to show that that this is important

564
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,440
um not not basically to to um you know

565
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
say that it's the be all end-all because

566
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
it's not

567
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,360
um gosh this is my old uh

568
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,559
linksys54g but um

569
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,080
these so gosh the bishop derailed me um

570
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,960
so

571
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
when you have like a

572
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,640
a corporation or maybe just a home

573
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,799
network typically you have a guest

574
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,480
network and you have a home network or a

575
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,000
corporate network and maybe like some

576
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
other like network for printers or or

577
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,799
like your thermostat right um

578
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,280
and so things to keep in mind are how

579
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
how does your guest network work does

580
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,000
your guest network allow um you know

581
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,679
users of your network to access other

582
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,000
devices like printers um

583
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
should uh the guest network so should

584
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,400
devices on that guest network be allowed

585
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
to talk with one another or should they

586
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
just be allowed internet access um these

587
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,520
are all things to take into

588
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
consideration because they they give

589
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,000
different security levels um and an

590
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,039
example of this is say i'm a and so this

591
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,400
is an example of the real world of

592
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
something i've actually done is there is

593
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,720
a company that has a guest network and

594
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
they have a corporate network all the

595
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,840
laptops you know that belong to the

596
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
corporate network obviously are on the

597
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,160
very strong you know wpa2 enterprise

598
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
with certificates um you know like

599
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,919
everything was plumbed up perfectly on

600
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,160
their corporate side uh however on their

601
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,559
guest side um you know there was no

602
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,919
there was no client isolation or

603
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,480
segmentation so what that means is that

604
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
if i'm on the guest network and somebody

605
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
else is on the guest network i can talk

606
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
to their machine and interact with their

607
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
machine um just in the same way that

608
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
they could talk back to me and why

609
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,919
that's powerful is that if i create some

610
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
disturbance in in the wi-fi force if i

611
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,840
you know send a bunch of

612
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,679
de-authentication packets or malicious

613
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,840
you know packets that kick everybody

614
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,679
else off the corporate network what's

615
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,640
the first thing that they're probably

616
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,600
going to do they're probably going to

617
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,679
want internet access and the devices

618
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
might even automatically kick over to

619
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,760
the guest network well now you have all

620
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
of your corporate devices that have now

621
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,200
connected this guest network with me an

622
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,280
adversary who's looking to compromise

623
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,600
them um and so then i run a bunch of

624
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,039
tools we don't have to get into a little

625
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,559
network or net pen of it all but hey if

626
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,320
i'm sharing the same network segment as

627
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,559
a bunch of other devices um you know

628
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,159
there's a bunch of ways that i can get

629
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,400
credentials out of that and so that's

630
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
one of those things it's not super

631
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
technical but when you think about it

632
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,880
all that would have taken right there is

633
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
client isolation to be in place so that

634
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
other devices couldn't talk um to other

635
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
devices on the network potentially

636
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
malicious uh you know threat actor like

637
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,280
myself um so again things to think about

638
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,720
uh captive portals you know do you want

639
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,559
to have captive portals so that you can

640
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,000
you know legally check the box that says

641
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
yes you know they have agreed that they

642
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
will not you know do bad things on this

643
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,760
network um or do you leave them be uh

644
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
you know that's it's just one of these

645
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,039
things that take all these things into

646
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,799
consideration and just think think about

647
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,039
it for a split second of how would an

648
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
attacker view this network and and what

649
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
are my goals for standing up this

650
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,960
network um because just even you know

651
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
thinking about it uh for for

652
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,480
even just a short period of time um will

653
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,840
will

654
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
will help you to make you know

655
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,679
more accurate determinations for what

656
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,039
you want to do going forward and help

657
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,840
you just make better decisions in

658
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
general

659
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,799
um another thing and this is again

660
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,240
something that i've done on the client's

661
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
side and really so i say all this not to

662
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,840
be like oh look at me i'm so good i'm a

663
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,679
hacker i say this because these are all

664
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,280
things that i've done to compromise our

665
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,679
clients um and and there are things that

666
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
uh i don't want threat actors to

667
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
compromise you know somebody who who

668
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,480
doesn't

669
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
you know who doesn't have these defenses

670
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,840
in place so that's my goal in all this

671
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
not to say look at me i can like break

672
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,520
into all these companies but just to say

673
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
hey take this into consideration um

674
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
because this is this is how i think this

675
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,640
is how other adversaries think um but

676
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,520
they're so so if you have like say um

677
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,280
g suite you know which is google's cloud

678
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,679
offering or say you have office 365

679
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,919
which is really popular with

680
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,880
a bunch of uh you know large companies

681
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
what what they'll do typically is

682
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
they'll have what's called trusted ip

683
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,600
addresses

684
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
and so from you know azure and outlook

685
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
in office 365 and how all that stuff

686
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,360
works they say hey you know what if

687
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,880
you're coming from inside the building

688
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,600
from a trusted public ip address um i

689
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,880
think they're called i think they're

690
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,720
called trusted ips or trusted trusted

691
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
addresses something along those lines

692
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,240
you can google it um

693
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,360
you know it's like hey you're coming we

694
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,799
see you're coming from the building so

695
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,919
what we're going to do is we're not

696
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,200
going to require you to do that pesky

697
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,960
two-factor authentication thing as long

698
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,159
as you have your username and password

699
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,320
that's all you need you're good to go uh

700
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,840
and why that's really dangerous is

701
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
typically um guest networks have the

702
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,960
same outbound public ip address that the

703
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,320
corporate network does you know maybe

704
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,840
there's network segmentation so that the

705
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
guest wi-fi can't talk to the corporate

706
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
wi-fi but if they have the same trusted

707
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
public ip address well now if i have a

708
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
username and password and i'm connected

709
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,679
to the guest wi-fi

710
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,080
the you know microsoft azure or g suite

711
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,320
now think hey i'm just coming from

712
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,679
inside the corporate network where i

713
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,240
don't need multi-factor authentication

714
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,840
and just like that now you're back to

715
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
single factor authentication and you

716
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
know then i can access your mailbox

717
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,039
without being prompted for all the

718
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,039
additional um requirements whether

719
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
that's like push whether that's a swipe

720
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,159
whether that's a face you know whatever

721
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,159
it is i won't be asked for it i'll just

722
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,720
old school username and password um

723
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,559
again this is something

724
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,080
how prevalent is this

725
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,960
i mean not not super prevalent um but

726
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
could it be if you're a high you know a

727
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,559
high value target or somebody really

728
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
wants to get access to your data um it's

729
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,159
something to at least consider and

730
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,000
that's all i'm asking from this is not

731
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
you need to implement these five things

732
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
to be secure but just take this into

733
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,039
consideration when you're designing your

734
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,640
network whether that's just for your

735
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,400
home whether that's for maybe a small

736
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,159
business that you help out or maybe if

737
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,559
you're you know the the cso or cto of

738
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,880
like a large company just take the stuff

739
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,039
into account when you um you know when

740
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,880
you're looking at it

741
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
um so again so let's let's also talk

742
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,760
about some other fun aspects of of data

743
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,240
that just showed in the clear um and how

744
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
even if your network is safe and secure

745
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,919
and has all the you know different types

746
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,200
of encryption strong passwords and all

747
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,120
that stuff how there can still be data

748
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,720
that's leaked out there

749
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,000
um so what we're going to be looking at

750
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,880
in this picture is uh mac addresses and

751
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,039
so mac addresses are basically that same

752
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,520
hardware address and every company the

753
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,400
the first what is that six octets um you

754
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
know the hex those values that you see

755
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,039
in red right there on your screen

756
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
those um are unique to a company they're

757
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
unique to like uh you know say hey all

758
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,480
of our devices that we manufacture all

759
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,720
going to have this similar octet why

760
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,840
does that matter you're thinking eric

761
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,679
you know big whoop it's like a serial

762
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,080
number um you know as far as wi-fi goes

763
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
and sure that's right probably doesn't

764
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,159
matter a whole lot but it does

765
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,480
allow for information about you know the

766
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,880
type of hardware that you're using

767
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,679
um

768
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
and so this you know this could allow

769
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,559
an identification of devices it can even

770
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,279
be

771
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,440
used for identification of people so if

772
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
i can see that hey i know you know that

773
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,400
the person that i want maybe the ceo of

774
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
this company i'm trying to get their

775
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
their badge or their password um i can

776
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
see that

777
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,840
uh you know his his

778
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,159
mac address is

779
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,480
18b430 right well now i can track that

780
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,720
user because they have a device that is

781
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,039
basically you know emanating a wireless

782
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,640
signal that's saying you know saying hey

783
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,279
track me right um now one thing that's

784
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,840
actually really positive is that uh in

785
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,640
in future or not future in like current

786
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
releases of the ios operating system and

787
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
probably android as well you can

788
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
randomize these mac addresses every time

789
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
you connect to a network and so why

790
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,200
that's great is that you can't be used

791
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
and found and fingerprinted on a network

792
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
if somebody's trying to follow you

793
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,520
throughout a building throughout a

794
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,760
parking lot throughout a large space on

795
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,279
these random addresses are really

796
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,440
helpful in you know basically making

797
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,799
that

798
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,840
very hard to do if not impossible to do

799
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,080
but what's also really interesting is

800
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,600
that when i see all these devices

801
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
connected to networks it gives me a good

802
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,159
feel for um

803
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,520
you know uh

804
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
for what that office layout looks like

805
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
um and you might be thinking like eric

806
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,279
how how how given these numbers could

807
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,600
you even you know think to you know hope

808
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,720
to think that you can know the office

809
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,880
layout is um so this top part of the

810
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,600
screen where it says vss id that is you

811
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,440
know the actual access point so from

812
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,039
those i can know hey

813
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,600
are you running cisco aruba ubiquity

814
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
netgear you know any of the big you know

815
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,279
wi-fi router you know

816
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,640
access point brands that you see out

817
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
there

818
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
you know because because their octets

819
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
are all unique to those companies i can

820
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,320
then say hey this is unique to this i

821
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,840
know that they're using cisco gear i

822
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,360
know that they're using you know this

823
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,840
type of

824
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,799
hardware and then if you look on the

825
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,720
bottom these are the connections that

826
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,440
are that are being made and so the bssid

827
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
is is the same as what you see up above

828
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
but the station is actually the device

829
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
that is connecting back to that access

830
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
point and so i can take a look at it and

831
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,880
say out of these stations i say hey

832
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,000
there's a bunch of you know apple

833
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,440
devices you know maybe these are all

834
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
macbooks um you know so if you know that

835
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
this company has a bunch of laptops and

836
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,720
and you're trying to discern hey do i

837
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,799
need to craft um a payload of some

838
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,039
malware for the apple operating system

839
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,640
or like a windows operating system this

840
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,240
can give you that insight right away and

841
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,320
again this is all in clear text you can

842
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,600
you know um

843
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,520
use air dump you know just to see all

844
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
this traffic in your home and and that's

845
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,600
it it's all it's all clear there's not a

846
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
way to obfuscate this or

847
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,679
you know other than randomly you know

848
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,279
assigning addresses to devices which

849
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,720
would be a huge pain and not really

850
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,399
worthwhile there's really not a good way

851
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
to defend against this but again this is

852
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
what an attacker is getting they can

853
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
know hey do you use primarily apple

854
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,159
products do you have um you know maybe

855
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,240
some obscure piece of you know internet

856
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,640
of things hardware um you know like a

857
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
smart toaster smart fridge that that

858
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,240
could potentially be compromised

859
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,320
um and so if you were to take a look at

860
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,360
these ones specifically that i've

861
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
highlighted if you were to go and google

862
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
what the station is of that 18b4 that

863
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,120
you see down below

864
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,360
um

865
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,480
[Music]

866
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
you know you can there's just a

867
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
duplicate of that slide

868
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,399
um you can basically say hey 18v430

869
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,240
that's neslabs oh they're running this

870
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,159
thermostat and then that gives an

871
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,159
attacker information saying hey is there

872
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,480
maybe um an attack associated with a

873
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,919
nest thermostat could you know is there

874
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,520
bluetooth on board is there zigbee is

875
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,360
there laura's or z-wave are these all

876
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
these other technologies maybe there's a

877
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,000
zero day in nest that's out there um

878
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,799
just all these things that that again

879
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,799
you can see just from the wireless you

880
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,720
know traffic that's that's out even it's

881
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,640
fully encrypted even if it you know has

882
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,480
great security on it it still gives an

883
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,799
attacker information about what you have

884
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,039
out there um and how do you fix this

885
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,480
well i don't know that you necessarily

886
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
do but again as long as you're aware of

887
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,399
it and as long as you're cognizant of it

888
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,600
when you're designing your network

889
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
either for your house small business for

890
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,320
your large corporation just knowing that

891
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,880
this is what is available out there will

892
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,360
go a long way into protecting um you

893
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,120
know you your clients and and your

894
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,360
employees

895
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,240
um

896
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,159
and so again this is this is like one of

897
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,679
these little boxes that we build that we

898
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,080
that we can deploy um to a client site

899
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,159
instead of having to show up on site but

900
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,000
we also have covert ones that for

901
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
obvious reasons i'm not going to show in

902
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
this in this presentation um but the

903
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
covert ones you know look like everyday

904
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,440
devices that would just sit in your sit

905
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,840
in your normal standard office building

906
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,480
um and we use those basically to

907
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,760
you know perform all these wireless

908
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,159
attacks that i just showed you um

909
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,159
but we do them you know

910
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
if the client knows if it's say like a

911
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
red team engagement um we're gonna do

912
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,880
the the you know the devices that that

913
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
blend in um if the client knows hey

914
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,080
we're just doing a wireless assessment

915
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,799
we'll send out a box like this um and

916
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,679
really

917
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,240
the like thinking like an adversary is

918
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,320
just is just you know uh putting

919
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
yourself in their shoes for a little bit

920
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,799
so that you can design a network that's

921
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,720
strong and robust that can repel you

922
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,799
know most attacks um you know obviously

923
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,799
nothing's full proof in in the world of

924
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,159
computers you know there's no hundred

925
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,399
percent but um but doing a little bit

926
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,520
goes a long way i promise you that um so

927
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,760
so i mean simple as not is not easy

928
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,440
right um

929
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,039
so if you were to just check for

930
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,279
excessive password spring right if you

931
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,200
can say that you know see that hey this

932
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,720
you know from our wireless controller

933
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,840
there's a bunch of users that are

934
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,279
getting their password sprayed or even

935
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,159
through office 365 um you know are you

936
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,919
getting alerts when a rogue access point

937
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,480
pops up um now do you have a if your

938
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,320
controller you know sends you a

939
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,440
notification in the middle of the night

940
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,120
says hey there's a rogue access point

941
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,279
out there do you have a way to go find

942
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,520
it to go track it down um you know does

943
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
your controller provide that capability

944
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,799
is it something you need to add is that

945
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,320
something you need to have like some

946
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
some hardware that maybe you have like

947
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,440
somebody in your team that goes out and

948
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,120
finds that um you know do you have a

949
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,399
plan in place have you thought about it

950
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,159
just say same thing like a fire drill

951
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,399
right like do you have an exit plan to

952
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,760
where you're gonna go

953
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,440
um you know understanding what data is

954
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
in clear text that you can't hide you

955
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,039
know potentially the devices like you

956
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,960
know smart home devices um you know uh

957
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,399
those can just be seen

958
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,799
by pretty much anybody so understanding

959
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,440
that you know now now allows you as

960
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,039
somebody who's on the defense to

961
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,120
basically make informed uh you know

962
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,679
informed choices um and log the data

963
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,519
like if you if your controller has the

964
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,120
ability to log data log it um and look

965
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,960
at your logs go back through and just

966
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,640
every so often just do a sanity check

967
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,000
just to make sure that you don't have

968
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
something sleeping in around your

969
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,880
network um just doing that will will go

970
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,440
a really long way

971
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,519
uh so anyways um i shortened that up a

972
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,679
bit because i'm sure a lot of you have a

973
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,120
lot of questions i'll be available in

974
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,279
the discord uh if you want to chat there

975
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,360
um you can find me on twitter at eric

976
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,200
escobar um or you can find me on

977
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,480
linkedin too i'm pretty much eric

978
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,919
escobar everywhere that you can find me

979
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,480
socially um but yeah i look forward to

980
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,640
hearing maybe stuff that that you all

981
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,720
have done out there um you know i look

982
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,399
forward to hearing you know maybe ways

983
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,399
that you've attacked clients or your own

984
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,799
you know your own network um and gained

985
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,480
access and in conventional ways that

986
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,320
