1
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,000
hello i'm joseph mann i'm a journalist

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
and this is fatal system error 2

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
more fatal than ever

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,000
in this talk i want to revisit my

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,960
2010 book fatal system error

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,400
which at the time

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,359
was the first mainstream book um to talk

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,200
about how dire the cyber security

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,719
landscape was

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,760
um

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,320
and since then of course it's it's it's

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,760
gotten much worse

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,399
um you know when i when i picked the

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,480
titles fatal system error

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,960
the idea was that um it was the the

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,440
system as a whole the combination of uh

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
porous technology

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
geopolitics uh and lacks law enforcement

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
uh capability that created this uh very

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
very serious problem in particular

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
alliance between organized criminal

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
groups

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
uh and certain governments uh especially

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
especially in russia and ukraine at the

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,119
time

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,880
and you know fatal system error was

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,400
meant to be kind of kind of a grabber

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
because one of the problems is that

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
these issues are frequently so abstract

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,759
or were frequently so abstract that it

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
was hard to get people up in arms and

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,640
really committed to doing something

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,479
about the problem

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,439
as intractable as as it was

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,799
um

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,240
that's no longer the case

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,640
now people are actually dying um there

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,119
there are ransomware attacks crippling

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,720
hospitals uh that are are costing uh

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
beds uh and

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
um resulting in an inability to do basic

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,399
tests

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,840
um for

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
you know people that need surgery and

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
the like and so people are actually

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,399
dying

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,560
from poor cyber security

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,360
um

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
and so it is you know long past time

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
to take these challenges uh on more

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
seriously and i'm actually

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
happy to report that um some things are

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
actually happening now some of the

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,920
things that

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
um should have been happening when i

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
when i when i was trying to get to

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
happen uh when i wrote the book uh 12

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
years ago um are actually finally

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,840
happening now um better late than never

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
and i'll go into that a little bit more

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
but uh first i'd like to say a little

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
bit about um myself um and why why texas

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,760
is important to me um

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
so i'm a mainstream journalist i've

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,640
written for major publications uh for my

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,599
whole career more than 25 years now uh

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,239
that includes the los angeles times the

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,920
financial times and most recently

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
reuters where i've been doing

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
investigative work on cyber security and

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,319
privacy for the last 10 years i've also

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,280
written

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
three solo books and i guess my journey

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,120
into the

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
the heart of cyber security began uh

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,159
with with the first one which was um

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,519
called all the rave and was like the

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,280
definitive inside history of napster

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
and napster was a super interesting

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
story because it was uh kind of what you

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
get when you combine

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
cutting-edge technology that's rapidly

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
developing and silicon valley greed

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,879
and

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
impatient amoral youth

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,200
and they together take on

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
one of the most dinosaur-like

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
establishments uh the record business in

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,799
that case

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,599
um

91
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,879
but despite the fact that um napster was

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
one of the best known brands

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,519
uh in in in the united states and a lot

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
of the world um 20 years ago

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,440
and sean fanning the the founder was on

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,560
the cover of time magazine

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
relatively few people knew what was

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
really going on some very fundamental

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
things about napster one was that um

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
sean fanning from the moment of

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,239
incorporation did not have control of

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
napster it was actually

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,879
his uncle john who had a history of

104
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
failed businesses and bad debts and

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
unhappy employees

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,360
uh another was that uh their base their

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,799
business strategy was basically

108
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,840
extortion they were gonna um even though

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,879
it was um you know legally they were on

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,279
extremely shaky ground their plan was to

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,839
get so big so fast and know more about

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,759
the record industry customers than the

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
record industry itself so that they

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,280
would be willing to pay

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,040
uh what they hoped would be billions of

116
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
dollars to make napster go away or to

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,119
convert it into into something legal

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,720
and the third thing that people didn't

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
know about napster is that sean fanning

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
was a straight up hacker

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,919
he

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,680
you know worked on port scanning and uh

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,479
he

124
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,080
used as beta testers um members of uh

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
irc

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,880
channels uh including uh pound hack uh

127
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
that um were devoted to the issues

128
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
issues of hacking in fact he was sort of

129
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
like the the first kind of you know good

130
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,600
guy personable hacker that people were

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
rooting for that got quite popular um

132
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
less less geeky than

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
been bill gates and and even and even

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
steve jobs um so the teens the teens

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
could relate um

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,759
but through working on that book i got

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
to know

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
many very serious hackers and very

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,440
talented security people

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
and um

141
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
they uh they kind of drove home to me um

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
how desperate the state of cyber

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
security was at that time in the early

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,280
oos

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
um and i continued to work on the on the

146
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,759
beat uh for the la times

147
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,840
and

148
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,680
um uh i noticed there was there's this

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,639
big

150
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,280
inflection point um that people missed

151
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
around 2003 2004 now before that time if

152
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,280
something went wrong with your computer

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,199
it was kind of random or you screwed up

154
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,680
or um somebody was pulling a prank or

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
you know something somebody somebody was

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,759
wanting to impress a stripper and wrote

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,600
a virus called uh

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,319
melissa and uh infected your

159
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,520
your computer

160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
after 2004 if something went wrong with

161
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
your computer it was the result most

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
likely of organized crime uh and this is

163
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
for very pedestrian reasons there were

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,360
spammers um who were making decent money

165
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,560
and spam was so ubiquitous that finally

166
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
sysadmins got around to blacklisting

167
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
various ip addresses known bad ip

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
addresses and and um and from addresses

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
so the spammers needed a bunch of clean

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,919
ip addresses

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,479
to send their their stuff and so they

172
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,440
hired virus writers uh who

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,199
could round up a whole bunch of

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,759
computers and harness them to the cause

175
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,960
or um they hired uh bot herders who had

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,840
uh had already done that um collected

177
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
these captive machines for use in

178
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,199
sending spam

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,479
so they did that

180
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,160
and then

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
they've got all these captive machines

182
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,039
and

183
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,080
they're looking for other ways to

184
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
monetize it

185
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,160
and so they start launching denial

186
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
service attacks and extorting websites

187
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
saying you know we're going to knock

188
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
over your your website uh and if you

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
don't pay us twenty thousand dollars by

190
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,880
western union um then your website's

191
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,319
gonna stay down

192
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,520
um so it's it's actually

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
what's happening today with ransomware

194
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,400
only in a less sophisticated level but

195
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
uh i got quite interested

196
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,160
in this because it wasn't particularly

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,759
sophisticated technologically but as a

198
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,639
business model and as an illustration

199
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,039
of the um the kind of smash and grab

200
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
mentality um that was

201
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
was growing and wasn't particularly

202
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
stoppable i thought it was a it was a

203
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
fairly good way to tell the story

204
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,440
um now one of the strange things about

205
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,479
it is

206
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,840
when these uh

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,440
denial of service extortionists were

208
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
just getting going one of their earliest

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
targets were

210
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,599
uh offshore gambling sites serving u.s

211
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,160
bettors um and that seems kind of kind

212
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,879
of like an odd choice but consider that

213
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
they had uh pretty poor infrastructure

214
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
being in um smaller central american

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,360
countries um they couldn't go to the fbi

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
because the fbi considered what they

217
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,199
were doing illegal um

218
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,520
and they had plenty of cash and they

219
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
could not under any circumstances be

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
down on super bowl sunday or the like uh

221
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
so they were attacking these these uh

222
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
these companies and i found out about

223
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,039
that and i called them and i said so

224
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,160
what happened i were you able to get

225
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,639
back online or you know um who helped

226
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,520
you

227
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
and a couple of them pointed me to a

228
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
young security professional in

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
california named barrett lyon

230
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
now uh

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
barrett um uh you know had had protected

232
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
them he did a denial service um

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,640
mitigation strategy uh but you know i

234
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
thought he was worth talking to so um he

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,320
happened to be in san francisco so he

236
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
came into my office

237
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,440
uh and uh you know he's in his early mid

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
and he's wearing flip-flops and shorts

239
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
and i said so you you know protected all

240
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
these gambling sites from these uh these

241
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,839
novel service attackers he was like yep

242
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,519
uh-huh figured out a way to do it was

243
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,640
fairly efficient you know it gave me

244
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
some geeky stuff i'm like okay that's

245
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,519
you know that's interesting that's

246
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,120
important but um

247
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,519
it's not it's not much of a grabber um

248
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,040
did you ever uh

249
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
figure out who who was behind the

250
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
attacks and he said uh oh yeah i chatted

251
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
to them i'm like what

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
uh and uh and he said yeah you know so

253
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
what i did is like um

254
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,279
they were directing the uh directing the

255
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
bots through uh internet relay chat so i

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,800
got onto the channel um that they were

257
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
doing it in and i pretended that i was a

258
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,920
bot herder too

259
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,480
and they hijacked my bots and so you

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
know it took a couple months but i like

261
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
you know eventually you know a couple of

262
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,839
them uh trusted me and i you know i

263
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,360
suggested that we work together i'm like

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
that's incredible like you don't uh you

265
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
don't have any like uh you know

266
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
transcripts of this do you and he's like

267
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
oh yeah here they are and i said well

268
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
that that's this is this is great you

269
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
never figured out like who they were did

270
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
you i mean like you know real name or

271
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
anything it's like yeah i got one guy's

272
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
uh real ip address he forgot to use a

273
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,000
vpn one time and uh

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,839
i was able to uh you know he let

275
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,040
something else left i was able to come

276
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
up with his uh

277
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
with his with his name

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
this is incredible so i wrote i wrote a

279
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
story about uh barrett's

280
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,839
um

281
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,440
war against these these russian

282
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
extortionists

283
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
uh and then

284
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,600
um

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,560
eventually that that that became a fatal

286
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,680
system error

287
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,480
um or a large part of fatal system error

288
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
there's there's american cyber mob in

289
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,079
there too um

290
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:30,839
but

291
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,519
um he was the he was the first time i

292
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,959
really got lucky and found a way to kind

293
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,959
of explain what was going on over there

294
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,880
and then i got lucky again because it

295
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
turns out that um

296
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
while the fbi wasn't interested in

297
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
protecting uh these groups um

298
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,240
after the the russians had built up a

299
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
pretty good uh revenue stream they went

300
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,760
after other uh companies including

301
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
publicly traded uh british gambling

302
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
firms um which are legal

303
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,680
um and the

304
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
the uk had just set up something called

305
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
the national high tech crime unit which

306
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,600
was pretty far ahead of its time and uh

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
included intelligence

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,640
operations and very good police and

309
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,279
other elements the government including

310
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,500
the diplomatic corps

311
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,600
[Music]

312
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,120
could be involved

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
so they took barrett's people very

314
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
barrett's research very seriously and

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
after the same gang was going after

316
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
british companies they sent a welsh

317
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,399
detective named andy crocker

318
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
to russia uh to work on the case um

319
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
and uh he got

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
he lived in russia for the better part

321
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,200
of

322
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
of of three years

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
to to bring to bring these guys to

324
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
justice

325
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
and actually succeeded

326
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,519
so

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,680
a very very unusual story this was

328
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,959
during a

329
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
relative high point in um

330
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,800
uh

331
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
russian uk cooperation it was before uh

332
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
some assassinations in particular the

333
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,920
davinco in in london

334
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,880
um

335
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,399
and

336
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
you know jack straw who's the british

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
foreign secretary asked his opposite

338
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
number in moscow for help on this case

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
uh and so there was a great deal of

340
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
pressure brought to bear

341
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,240
um and andy andy was you know

342
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,000
extraordinarily dedicated learned

343
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
learned the ways of of russia um and uh

344
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
and worked on worked on this case um

345
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,519
and uh he discovered that um cyber crime

346
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
is pretty rampant particularly cyber

347
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,760
crime against western companies um and

348
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
this is for like a number of reasons

349
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,959
that i want to

350
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,160
explain a little bit because if you

351
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
haven't spent time in russia it's sort

352
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,880
of hard to understand

353
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
um

354
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
the reason that there is so much cyber

355
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,760
crime uh in russia and

356
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,839
neighboring

357
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,200
countries uh has to do

358
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
with a number of factors one is

359
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,560
uh the technical skills are very high

360
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
in

361
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,360
in russia uh math and engineering um are

362
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,839
you know admired

363
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:05,839
skills um

364
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,560
people there isn't any sort of geek

365
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,839
prejudice against geeks or nerds um

366
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,040
so that's one thing there are a lot of

367
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,560
you know they're they're very serious

368
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,920
academic programs people get very good

369
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
but there is no silicon valley there is

370
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,760
no obvious way to get um a lot of money

371
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,200
from these skills

372
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,079
um in legitimate businesses um

373
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,639
uh russia is trying to create um a

374
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
silicon valley um

375
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,040
uh but it's not you know it's it's not

376
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
like it is here

377
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,959
um third factor is that

378
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,000
um crime is just not seen as that bad

379
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
it's

380
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,199
it's just kind of a fact of life uh and

381
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,800
particularly if you're doing committing

382
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,079
crimes against people who live in other

383
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,040
countries

384
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,680
it's um it's not looked down upon uh in

385
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,480
fact their uh hacker magazine like

386
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
celebrates the the exploits of

387
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
of uh the more successful hackers and

388
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,399
it's got them

389
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,160
you know you know when on the on the on

390
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
the car covering their magazine with

391
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,959
like um you know uh sports cars and

392
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,480
models and you know gold jewelry and

393
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
you know it's it's like um

394
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,800
it's it's it's a cool thing um and then

395
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,959
the last factor

396
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,519
for why this is so big uh why cybercrime

397
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,639
is so big

398
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,560
is that the the corruption is really

399
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,040
mind-blowing um russia is an incredibly

400
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
corrupt place

401
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
the

402
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,440
the police and the other other public

403
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
servants make very little money from

404
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
their official salaries

405
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,240
so um they supplement that by shaking

406
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
various uh people down

407
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,360
um

408
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
and um that's kind of just the way

409
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,760
things are there um

410
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
if i could um

411
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
explain it in one way like one way to

412
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,079
look at it is that um

413
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,880
you know

414
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
why is it that you know of all the like

415
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,560
the the um uh of all the um

416
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,440
uh

417
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
jobs in law enforcement you're gonna

418
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,399
have in moscow

419
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,639
the one that pays the least is tr is

420
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,240
basically a traffic cop

421
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
and yet that is the most sought after

422
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
job because that gives you the most

423
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,839
opportunity to interface with your

424
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
public and shake down your public

425
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
um

426
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,079
everybody there knows how

427
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,920
corrupt it is there's a there's a joke

428
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
that andy was told by his friends in the

429
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,279
mvd the equivalent of the fbi over there

430
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,440
because uh that goes like this there is

431
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,560
a an american tourist in um in moscow

432
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,680
and he has his uh passport stolen and he

433
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,279
does what he's supposed to do in a

434
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,120
situation like that which is he gets in

435
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,759
touch with the u.s embassy and so uh he

436
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
says hey uh uh you know somebody

437
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,240
somebody stole my passport

438
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,839
uh and the embassy guy says what he's

439
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
supposed to which is like well did you

440
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,079
notify the mvd and the guy says yeah

441
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,439
they they say they didn't do it

442
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
so

443
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,920
everybody knows how corrupt

444
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,959
elements of the mvd and the fsb are

445
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
um it's just the way things are in fact

446
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,079
when um when andy was starting to work

447
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,399
on the case and fatal system error

448
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
it turned out that there was some

449
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,040
tension between the mvd and the fsb one

450
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,719
of the main successors to the old um

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,759
the old main spy service there

452
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,320
and um

453
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,519
[Music]

454
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,680
it turns out that there's tension over

455
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,079
uh who works uh cyber crime cases and

456
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,320
that's because it's a revenue stream

457
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
it's not like the fbi and secret service

458
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
are in a turf war because they want the

459
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,040
like the glamour or the credit for

460
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,959
taking down some real bad guys

461
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,720
it's because it's a revenue stream if

462
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
the mvd gets to a cyber crime kingpin

463
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,079
first they can

464
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,320
see how much money they can get from him

465
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
either to avoid arrest or if he has been

466
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,720
arrested to get out of jail

467
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,039
and the fsb once these guys are starting

468
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,359
to make serious money the fsb thinks

469
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,919
that's that's attractive as well

470
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:10,720
um

471
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,280
so um you've got that kind of thing

472
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,400
going on

473
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,280
um

474
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,439
so uh

475
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,199
i want to tell you um

476
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
um

477
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,880
um i i'm going to come back to that in a

478
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,400
second i just want to digress a little

479
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,720
bit and talk about why i like i like

480
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,000
texas so much

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,559
so um

482
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
fatal system error came out as i said in

483
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
2010 um and it was it was um

484
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,280
it was depressing um

485
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
uh

486
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
like i said uh it was supposed to be

487
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,600
depressing it was supposed to be a

488
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
wake-up call on how bad things are the

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
attack service is getting bigger

490
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,160
uh you know russia doesn't bother to

491
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
arrest these people it it's a you know

492
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,919
it's it's against russian law to

493
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,440
extradite anybody

494
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,160
um uh and um

495
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
they were beginning to view these

496
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,799
hackers as a strategic asset against

497
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,160
rival countries including the united

498
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,240
states so i wrote that book and it was

499
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
it was big in congress and in cyber

500
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
security

501
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,520
and

502
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,600
it was depressing um

503
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,559
and

504
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,840
as the years go by i didn't want to

505
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
write another another book that said hey

506
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,679
things are still terrible or they're

507
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,760
even worse now um so instead i was

508
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
looking to to write something that was

509
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,400
um

510
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,799
uh hopeful uh and and instructive uh

511
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,400
here are some things that work in cyber

512
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
security essentially

513
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
and what i i hit upon was a group called

514
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
the cult of the dead cow

515
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,919
and the cult of the dead cow was created

516
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,320
in lubbock texas by some teenage

517
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,280
bulletin board service operators

518
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
um who aspire to be serious hackers but

519
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
weren't really they're like you know

520
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,240
phone freaks and and like um

521
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,960
but they morphed over time and the clubs

522
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,160
the dead cow

523
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,400
uh added some serious technical um folks

524
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
and they famously released

525
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,679
a

526
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
program called back orifice and then

527
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,960
back orifice 2000 which were

528
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
scripts that allowed anyone to hijack a

529
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,000
windows

530
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,120
box

531
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,360
and they you know is quite controversial

532
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,400
but they

533
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
they played a huge role in forcing

534
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
microsoft to take security more

535
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
seriously because they turn it into like

536
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,440
a media circus

537
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
uh the cdc also coined the term

538
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,400
hacktivism which they defined as hacking

539
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
and security work in service of human

540
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,200
rights

541
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
uh

542
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,320
activism

543
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,600
um

544
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,559
in well in in in part because of my book

545
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,000
uh there's been this resurgence of

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
activism new attention on it and this

547
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
has actually been the biggest year um

548
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
ever in hacktivism and some of the major

549
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,440
targets have been in texas including

550
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,559
uh the uh one of the um

551
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,400
the sites where you could

552
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,240
rat out somebody for getting an abortion

553
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,919
or for assisting a woman to get an

554
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,400
abortion after the texas law was upheld

555
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
um by the courts um

556
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,840
uh

557
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,960
that got that got packed um the more

558
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
recently the texas uh republican party's

559
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,240
site got hacked um and uh and so on and

560
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,840
so forth there have been um

561
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
it's been it's been quite a quite a live

562
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
center for uh for hacktivism

563
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
um

564
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
one of the things that's interesting to

565
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,200
me about the call to the dead cow is

566
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,159
that

567
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,159
they're the longest running and most

568
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,240
influential u.s hacking group

569
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,960
um another thing is that they

570
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
they went outside of their areas of

571
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,679
comfort outside of their comfort zones

572
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
they got into

573
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,280
you know they founded a billion dollar

574
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
business

575
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
one of them went to run cyber grant

576
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,320
making at darpa

577
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
they testified before congress

578
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
they came up with coordinated

579
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
vulnerability disclosure they did all

580
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
these monumental things

581
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,799
besides activism

582
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,640
and they also got into

583
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,080
into politics

584
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,039
so some of you may know that

585
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,960
one of them one of the earliest members

586
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,720
of the collective dead cow is a

587
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,799
gentleman named bear o'rourke

588
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,320
and a couple years ago he ran for the

589
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,919
white house and you may soon be running

590
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,640
for governor of texas so i have a

591
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
special interest in texas um so thanks

592
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
for having me here now back to fatal

593
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,360
system here um

594
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,559
um

595
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,080
so

596
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,919
like i said it would it's it's very hard

597
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,480
to get somebody arrested uh even with

598
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,120
the kind of support that andy got uh

599
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,360
from from the mvd

600
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
um and um they did get these guys and

601
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
they got sent off for eight years in

602
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
prison um

603
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,600
uh

604
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
but that's not really the point of the

605
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,440
the book uh the point of the book is is

606
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,280
what happened when they tried to go

607
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
upstream and get

608
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
um the people that were above these

609
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,400
these three extortionists that that andy

610
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,120
uh andy caught um and if you don't mind

611
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
if you'll indulge me here i'm gonna i'm

612
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
gonna read a little bit from from uh

613
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,440
from from the book

614
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,679
um

615
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
andy thought he would aim as high as

616
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
possible at at a man named king arthur

617
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,280
through dogged but until now secret work

618
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
on the carter planet case

619
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
the u.s postal service greg crabb had

620
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,840
succeeded in identifying king arthur as

621
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,919
archer gallagher a man in his early

622
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,600
twenties living in the russian republic

623
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
of dagestan

624
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
gallagher was taking in millions of

625
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,039
dollars from citibank fishing and other

626
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
scams with the aid of numerous u.s

627
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
accomplices according to postal service

628
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,240
documents

629
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
in a meeting with two mvd men to discuss

630
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
other business andy pressed his luck

631
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,039
this case is going well let's keep it

632
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,720
going follow this thing upstream he told

633
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,880
the others let's go after king arthur

634
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
he's as bad as they get and he's gotten

635
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,640
millions of dollars if we get him that

636
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,919
will show everyone how serious the

637
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,600
russian government is it could change

638
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,559
everything

639
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,720
there was an awkward pause

640
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,600
he's in dagestan one of the mbd men said

641
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,280
the tone reminded andy of the famous

642
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,799
line from roman plansky's great

643
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
corruption movie

644
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,640
forget it jake it's chinatown

645
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
so he's in dagestan great you know where

646
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,440
he is andy persistent feigning ignorance

647
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,520
it's different there very rough the

648
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,120
other man put in as if talking to a

649
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,159
child

650
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
that's not a problem andy said i'm not

651
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
afraid i'll go anywhere

652
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,400
the mvd man exchanged looks the first

653
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,919
cleared his throat

654
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
the fsb is dealing with him they know

655
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,919
who he is he said trying to sound

656
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,600
reassuring as he brought up the spy

657
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,360
agency that was the greatest power in

658
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,400
the country

659
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,480
well then the fsb can go to dagestan and

660
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
he said but he sensed this wasn't going

661
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
to work out

662
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,679
they aren't interested in him right now

663
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,240
the mvd agent shrugged signaling it into

664
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,679
the subject

665
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,120
what they didn't tell andy was that

666
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
department k operatives had already

667
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,320
tried to get king arthur they had

668
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,240
prepared a report and sent it to the mvd

669
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
investigative committee asking the elite

670
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
squad to conduct interviews and make an

671
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,960
arrest

672
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,279
the committee never pursued the case

673
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,559
and he also brought up the issue with

674
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,840
igor yakovlev his closest mvd friend why

675
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,000
won't anyone arrest king arthur he asked

676
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the politically savvy eager shrugged

677
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
said he didn't know and gave the

678
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
all-purpose explanation andy had heard

679
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,200
most of the days he had been in the

680
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
country

681
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,360
it is russia

682
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,880
it made an unfortunate amount of sense

683
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,720
to andy they've got him with the threat

684
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
of 10 years in prison he thought they

685
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,559
said either come work for us or go to

686
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,440
prison

687
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,960
why would he not especially if they let

688
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,720
him continue making money

689
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,400
knowing how things worked in russia it

690
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
was possible that king arthur was just

691
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,080
driving his way to continued freedom but

692
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
that was unlikely in the ordinary course

693
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
of events a suspect would be arrested

694
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,919
first giving officials the most leverage

695
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,679
to negotiate payment

696
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,679
not only had king arthur

697
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,360
not been arrested no one had even come

698
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,799
close to arresting him

699
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,720
besides too many countries had been

700
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,159
demanding king arthur's head for too

701
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,400
long for a simple bribe to work

702
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
it would be too sensitive to just take

703
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,679
money and not arrest him and he told a

704
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,600
friend so the only reason it goes

705
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,480
nowhere is he's protected by someone

706
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,880
in 2009 king arthur was still dispensing

707
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
advice on carter forms serving as a

708
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,600
mentor to the next generation

709
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,520
the bottom line is the king either king

710
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
arthur and others are off limits because

711
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
they're extremely useful when it comes

712
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,840
to attacking enemies of the criminal

713
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
kremlin be them be they internal

714
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,919
political opponents or sovereign

715
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:10,880
governments

716
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
such as those in estonia and georgia

717
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
which have had official media sites shut

718
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,799
down by denial service attacks that use

719
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,400
the infrastructure of well-known russian

720
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,880
criminals

721
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,559
so um

722
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,799
that's what it was like then

723
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,799
and now i'd like to turn to

724
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,520
what's changed for better and and for

725
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
worse

726
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,799
so um for worse uh

727
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,400
you know these guys didn't have great

728
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
technical skills at the time

729
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
and the their technical abilities have

730
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
gotten much better the ability to

731
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,559
penetrate

732
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,919
even pretty

733
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
serious seriously defended companies

734
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,679
and distribute ransomware which you know

735
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,279
itself is more sophisticated certainly

736
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,159
than non-service attack

737
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,520
but really a lot of this is about

738
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
business innovation

739
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,360
one of the things i learned in writing

740
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,039
the book is that the bad guys do

741
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,520
capitalism better than we do

742
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,480
defenders are unclear about

743
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,320
where to spend their money and it's very

744
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,600
hard to measure

745
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,039
the reward for the money that is

746
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,880
invested you don't know what works

747
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
really to keep people out

748
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,400
you only know what fails after the fact

749
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,960
whereas the bad guys can easily measure

750
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
where the money comes in and do more of

751
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,080
that

752
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,400
um they invest in r d

753
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
they work really long hours they work

754
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,039
quite hard

755
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,679
um and they specialize so you know one

756
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,080
guys got you know a botnet that he rents

757
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,159
out by the day or by the hour somebody

758
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,720
else is a virus writer uh somebody else

759
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
uh specializes in gaining initial access

760
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,520
and then their brokers for that access

761
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
to get into a given company

762
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,559
um

763
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,960
ransom you know the same way that they

764
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
used to say that uh you know innovation

765
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,480
was driven by the porn industry

766
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,080
innovation is now really driven by the

767
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
crime industry

768
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,960
um so you have places like ebay where

769
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
buyers and sellers and various vendors

770
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,480
of services

771
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,600
our rate are vetted and rated

772
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,520
and if you're a scammer or ripper and

773
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
you rip off other criminals then you get

774
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,360
banned from the form

775
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,960
so it's extraordinarily effective

776
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,080
those are some of the things that have

777
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,840
gotten worse

778
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,240
um but probably you know the biggest

779
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,960
thing that has gotten worse has been the

780
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,039
tightening of the alliance between some

781
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,360
elements of the criminal ecosystem

782
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,919
and major figures in the russian

783
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,039
government

784
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,880
uh so

785
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,080
you know before

786
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,240
you know beforehand you know

787
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
like any criminal might pay somebody off

788
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,679
and the cyber criminals uh did as well

789
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,919
but then they started being very useful

790
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:48,640
for

791
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,760
cyber warfare against gastonia

792
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
excuse me estonia and georgia uh and

793
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,919
others um

794
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,279
uh

795
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,279
and then you know it became much more

796
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,120
serious as this is sort of like the wars

797
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,600
of the future you've got attacks in

798
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,799
ukraine

799
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,039
um you've got sort of uh stuff that's

800
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,039
disguised as hacktivism

801
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,960
um that's you know hacking and leaking

802
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,919
stuff

803
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,279
um

804
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,840
and let me and and some and you know i i

805
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,880
want to i want to make clear i don't

806
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
want to overstate this most ransomware

807
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,919
actors are common criminals in it for

808
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,960
money

809
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,039
um but there are times

810
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,720
you know and you know but even then

811
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,559
there's an important um

812
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,279
government overlay uh certainly if putin

813
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,960
wanted to crack down he could he could

814
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,480
crack down these people could be

815
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
arrested they could be sent to jail it

816
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,559
is not a priority

817
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,720
at all for the russian for the russian

818
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,000
government

819
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,799
um

820
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
so another thing that's gotten worse of

821
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,440
course actually is is cryptocurrency so

822
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,520
in the old days when when barrett and

823
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,840
andy were fighting these guys you know

824
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,600
the money would go to western union or

825
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,039
something like that and would have to go

826
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,840
to

827
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,480
uh human beings in estonia or latvia or

828
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,520
someplace uh money mules who would go to

829
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,120
western union physically collect the

830
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
money and then um see if they were

831
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,640
getting tailed and then handed off to

832
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,360
somebody else so there are risks of

833
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,840
arrest and

834
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,880
infiltration um

835
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,320
and it was super inefficient

836
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
cryptocurrency solves basically all of

837
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,480
those problems so it's a much more

838
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
liquid uh

839
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,918
liquid uh market unfortunately

840
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,320
um so on that in terms of government

841
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,799
overlap we have now had documented cases

842
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,399
where um

843
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,320
fsb officers

844
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
um are

845
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,440
are literally criminals uh so in the in

846
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,919
the in there was a big breach at yahoo

847
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,240
where

848
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,799
millions and millions of email accounts

849
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,799
were compromised at once

850
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,640
in the ensuing indictment out of san

851
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,799
francisco

852
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,240
there were two fsb officers named in

853
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,320
addition to um you know sort of

854
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,720
full-time criminals there are people who

855
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,200
as in the the theory about king arthur

856
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,840
um who go from criminal to working

857
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,159
inside in-house one of the um

858
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,559
uh one one of the major uh intelligence

859
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,279
or police agencies there um

860
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,720
um

861

and there are there's a lot of

862
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,640
moonlighting uh moonlighting as well

863
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,600
um

864
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,799
in in the in the case of um

865
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,960
in the case of um

866
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,480
of ransomware

867
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,399
uh specifically

868
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,440
uh let me tell you about uh a man named

869
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,760
um evgeny bogechev

870
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760

software and distributing early

874
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,440
ransomware called cryptolocker

875
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
though it was not part of the uh

876
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,720
indictment against bogota came over

877
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,640
zeus's pattern of data collection

878
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039

884
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,960
earlier this year

885
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,600

887
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,039
oversaw the case during the obama

888
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,559

894
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
pay more according to adam meyers of

of dollars in reward money and

908
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
information leading to the arrests of

909
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,159
bogojava and yakobets and published

910
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,000
photographs of them but mysteriously

911
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,279
they have not been apprehended by

912
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,600
russian authorities

913
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
uh analysts told reuters that jakobetz

914
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,120
is married to the daughter of a former

915
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,919
senior fsb operative which might help

916
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,360
even more

917
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
okay so that's the bad news what has

918
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,960
gotten better since fatal system error

919
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,159
well

920
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,600
research and attribution are a lot

921
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,799
better

922
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,320
it used to be it was just

923
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,559
extraordinarily hard to

924
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,679
figure out whose fingers were on the

925
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,720
keyboard

926
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
uh it's now it's now for a variety of

927
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,360
reasons uh gotten much more doable

928
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,760
private industry has gotten way better

929
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,120
uh and the fbi secret service are much

930
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,159
uh

931
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,080
much more talented in in these skills

932
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,760
they have actual native

933
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,679
digital experts now which didn't used to

934
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,440
be a thing at either

935
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,840
agency there's also serious cooperation

936
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
between

937
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,840
public and private entities that really

938
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,919
was just lip service before

939
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,480
even the nsa is not only

940
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
identifying exploits that are in the

941
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,159
wild but warning the private sector

942
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,960
about which ones are being exploited

943
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
in in mass so people know what to

944
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,399
prioritize uh in defense

945
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,640
um reporting requirements are expanding

946
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,559
and i think we're going to expand

947
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,320
more soon so the companies that are

948
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,399
victims of ransomware will at least have

949
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,399
to tell the feds about it

950
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,679
even with some sort of privacy

951
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,679
protection and that means that the feds

952
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,120
can prioritize you know which are the

953
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,720
most active ransomware groups and what

954
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200
techniques are they're using right now

955
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
the feds are only seeing maybe 20 of

956
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,640
what's happening out there there's also

957
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,440
been

958
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
an increase in

959
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,159
uh naming and shaming of of

960
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,760
foreign criminals

961
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
including members of um

962
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,240
of intelligence agencies in china and

963
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,679
russia and iran that is um that's

964
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,360
embarrassing for those countries and it

965
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,320
means that

966
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,240
those people can't go to nice places on

967
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,760
vacation because they could get caught

968
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,279
and extradited

969
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,480
um and it helps turn world opinion and

970
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,799
solidify allies

971
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,440
um which is is really important in in

972
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,120
trying uh trying to combat this stuff

973
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,480
uh and then

974
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,039
uh finally um

975
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
you know this this whole of government

976
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,000
approach um being undertaken by the buy

977
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
administration

978
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,719
is starting to show some really

979
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,520
interesting fruit

980
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,399
the trump white house eliminated cyber

981
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,839
coordinator

982
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,199
position

983
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,520
was extremely reluctant to pursue

984
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,359
sanctions against russia

985
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,760
um for reasons i think we all know here

986
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
um

987
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,719
and um that has all changed um uh under

988
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,879
under white house they've

989
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,679
put in into some very serious officials

990
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,560
in in in roles including the national

991
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,159
cyber coordinator

992
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,599
um uh and a deputy national security

993
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,239
advisor for cyber uh and neuberger that

994
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,879
was a position that didn't exist before

995
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,000
it's um

996
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,560
it's and and they've they've worked with

997
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,359
allies to try and

998
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
um press russia

999
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,960
uh to crack down and to go after

1000
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,839
uh the worst of the cryptocurrency

1001
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,320
exchanges that are favored by criminals

1002
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,200
for for money laundering it's a huge job

1003
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
they're also trying to get legislation

1004
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,760
through congress it's a huge task um but

1005
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,560
like the battle is finally joined

1006
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,079
many of these things that i called for

1007
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,320
in the last chapter of fatal system

1008
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,800
error are actually happening now um in

1009
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,520
term in terms of combating this stuff

1010
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,760
and uh when i say the battle has been

1011
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,119
joined

1012
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,560
as of this month i can say that

1013
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,240
literally

1014
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,359
which is which is really exciting um so

1015
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,160
one of the worst ransomware groups uh

1016
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,839
was named rebel

1017
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,359
r-e-v-i-l

1018
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,839
uh and their ransomware as a service

1019
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,960
so somebody else would break into

1020
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,680
a company a target company or uh or

1021
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,640
purchase

1022
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,160
a a foothold there and then they could

1023
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,760
deploy rival

1024
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
ransomware and we would rival would

1025
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
handle the negotiations

1026
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,680
and the publicity if

1027
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,599
they wanted to embarrass and publish

1028
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,520
information as part of a double

1029
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
extortion scheme which has become

1030
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,119
uh

1031
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,760
pretty standard now and is also a great

1032
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,400
way to launder intelligence goals

1033
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,760
um

1034
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,359
so uh repo hit the jb jbs uh the world's

1035
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,359
largest meatpacker or one of them

1036
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,760
earlier this year they also hit cassaya

1037
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,839
which is super important because cassaya

1038
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,920
made tools for

1039
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,839
software management that was deployed

1040
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,880
inside more than more than a thousand

1041
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,839
businesses and and other organizations

1042
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,320
and because uh rival got in through them

1043
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,079
they were able to in fact or their

1044
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,240
affiliates were able to infect more than

1045
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
a hundred companies at once

1046
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,839
um so this became a a top priority and

1047
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,240
if you've listened to the rhetoric

1048
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,320
from from biden and others in the white

1049
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,960
house they've been talking about

1050
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,480
how ransomware has become a national

1051
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,440
security issue that's because of the of

1052
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,079
the hospital attacks um which again i

1053
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,839
you know i i think are mostly about

1054
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,040
money um but are killing people uh in a

1055
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,599
time of a global pandemic

1056
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,880
and attacks on places like colonial

1057
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,880
the colonial pipeline the largest

1058
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,599
gas pipeline in the united states that

1059
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,240
led to it being shut down for days early

1060
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,000
this year and causing spot gas shortages

1061
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,040
in pockets of the country

1062
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,359
because they have deemed this a national

1063
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,320
security threat on par with terrorism

1064
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,560
new legal authorities uh have been

1065
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
opened up as i was able to

1066
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,720
report um a couple weeks ago um that

1067
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
means that um

1068
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,240
hacking back

1069
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,400
is uh is a thing now uh not only by the

1070
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,040
fbi or companies working for the fbi the

1071
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,920
secret service but by the nsa which is

1072
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,760
part of the us military

1073
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
so when i say the battle has been joined

1074
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,560
the battle has been joined and the

1075
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,400
awesome power of

1076
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,440
the nsa and allied uh military

1077
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,680
intelligence services were actually able

1078
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,320
to penetrate reevil's uh servers

1079
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,359
um gather intelligence and then when it

1080
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,680
uh the the jig was eventually up when

1081
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,520
one of the leaders of rival

1082
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,160
uh pulled the plug on it uh and uh and

1083
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,079
and said that they'd been compromised

1084
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,680
and wished everybody luck and

1085
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,079
disappeared um

1086
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,359
you know so

1087
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,960
caveats here plenty of them um uh

1088
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,599
we'll re the people in reville form new

1089
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,560
groups sure yes uh is the other

1090
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,880
ransomware software readily available

1091
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,160
yeah you bet um

1092
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,560
will this deter uh others maybe a little

1093
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,440
um

1094
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,000
it may also provoke some retribution uh

1095
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,839
there was another there were some calls

1096
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,839
for attacking

1097
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:56,800
u.s

1098
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,359
u.s assets

1099
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,680
uh deliberately because of the reveal

1100
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,800
shutdown

1101
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,720
um

1102
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,640
but um the risk reward uh ratio is

1103
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,119
changing uh for these for these criminal

1104
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,480
groups now um and you have to

1105
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
if you want to knock over

1106
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,000
a business that's going to give you a

1107
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,280
lot of money particularly if it's a part

1108
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,720
of critical infrastructure which is one

1109
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,839
of the things

1110
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,000
biden complained about in

1111
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,200
to putin earlier this year

1112
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,359
you're going to you risk bringing the

1113
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,640
u.s military down on you and also the

1114
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,200
intelligence capabilities of european

1115
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,760
uh european partners

1116
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,680
and that's a pretty big risk

1117
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,960
when you could

1118
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,720
you know make as much money knocking

1119
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,560
over smaller places in other countries

1120
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,760
so

1121
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
maybe it escalates

1122
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,440
maybe the criminals go elsewhere

1123
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,400
but the us is finally using its

1124
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,200
capability against

1125
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,640
these bad guys

1126
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,119
um who are literally killing us and have

1127
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,800
the potential to do

1128
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,880
uh crippling damage to

1129
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,440
many sectors of the economy so

1130
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,520
um i'm sorry that it took this long i'm

1131
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,440
sorry that people had to start dying for

1132
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,040
this to happen

1133
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
you know but it but it it has finally

1134
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
happened and um

1135
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,160
the world is

1136
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,319
is finally engaging

1137
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,240
uh very very serious um set of enemies

1138
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,960
um so uh that's all i have and uh i

1139
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,839
guess i can uh take your uh your your

1140
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,079
your questions on on discord or or the

1141
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,520
other services now

1142
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,119
um i really appreciate the chance of

1143
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,040
being able to talk to you um you know if

1144
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,160
you're here if you're watching this

1145
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,440
you're probably

1146
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,880
interested in doing good um and

1147
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,280
there are many ways of doing good

1148
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,800
one is by hunting down these bad guys

1149
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,560
another now is by working inside the

1150
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,400
government working inside some of these

1151
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
terrific private sector companies that

1152
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
are doing so much great work

1153
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,440
and great research

1154
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
and then there's like really cool stuff

1155
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,480
you can do

1156
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,000
in your off time

1157
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,920
as a volunteer or as a contributor to

1158
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,599
open source projects

1159
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,240
as the folks in the occult of the dead

1160
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,280
dead cow

1161
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,240
made clear so i hope you get a chance to

1162
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,079
to read those books

1163
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,040
and continue to fight the good fight

1164
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,759
thanks very much for your time
