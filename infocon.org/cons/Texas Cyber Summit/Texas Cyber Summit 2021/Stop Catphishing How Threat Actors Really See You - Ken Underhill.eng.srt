00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,440
fishing how threat actors really see you

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,720
presentation

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,240
my name is ken underhill i'll be your

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,320
presenter for this session

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,599
many people in the industry probably

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,920
know me if you don't i've basically

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,599
helped a lot of people and i've won some

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
awards

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,600
i started my career in healthcare i t so

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,039
i actually worked as a clinician i

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,560
worked as a pediatric nurse for a number

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,760
of years

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
moved back into the i.t realm i was in

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,400
it many many years before i was a nurse

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
and came back into it worked in network

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,120
engineering network security around that

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,800
moved more into the cyber security or

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
quote unquote cyber security type of

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,399
roles it wasn't called that back then

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,239
but uh from there i've worked a variety

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,079
of roles worked as a pen tester and

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,000
other things i'm currently a an

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,760
executive for a startup

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
as well as running multiple companies

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
myself i also have a tv show and that's

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,440
what you see depicted in the top right

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,360
there and like i said i've won multiple

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
awards i'm up for some others et cetera

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,079
et cetera

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,559
that's enough about me long story short

32
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,239
helped a lot of people and that's what

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,719
really matters

34
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,559
so what is the problem we're going to be

35
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
talking about today well

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
we've got this issue out there and if

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
you haven't experienced this yet you are

38
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
very very lucky as an organization but

39
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,840
what a lot of places are finding is that

40
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
their cyber security premiums are going

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
up and they're literally going up in

42
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,840
many cases overnight

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,640
and we're seeing man it's crazy we're

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
seeing like a 5x 10x increase especially

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
for like your small medium-sized

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,560
businesses and so for a lot of them that

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
type of increase that that puts them out

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
of business they can't afford that

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
insurance

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
and why is it happening well

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
one of the main reasons is all these

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
supply chain attacks so

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
insurance companies just like with your

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
car insurance or anything else

55
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
they focus on risk

56
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
and traditionally

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
cyber's been kind of ignored as far as a

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,920
risk standpoint and saying well okay

59
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
there might be a breach or something

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,360
like that no big deal so rates have you

61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
know pretty been pretty straight

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
stagnant over the years

63
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
for the most part

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,799
but

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,960
with all these more public

66
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
attacks insurance companies are saying

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,038
whoa wait a minute here what's going on

68
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,560
is this company affected well that's a

69
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,879
big risk so even though you as an

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,239
organization

71
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,400
haven't been targeted well you

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
realistically have and you and you

73
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
realistically have been hacked as well

74
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,040
but

75
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
even though you're not in the news

76
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
of saying hey company x has got a data

77
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,400
breach

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,440
you're still a risk because

79
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
other companies in your industry have

80
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,239
been hit

81
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
or just the fact that there's all these

82
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
supply and chain attacks out there going

83
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,319
on and it's a risk now for these

84
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,760
insurers so again just like your car

85
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,519
insurance if you get in a bunch of

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,200
accidents if you drink and drive

87
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,239
anything like that or even if you're a

88
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,800
male versus a female when you're younger

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
there's a bigger risk that you may be

90
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
involved in an accident

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,400
where the insurance company has to pay

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
money and so because of that risk your

93
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
premiums are a little higher so we're

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
seeing that same effect here in cyber

95
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,519
lately especially for the small to

96
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,959
mid-sized organizations and

97
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,560
unfortunately a lot of them

98
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
can't afford that now the other side of

99
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,800
this

100
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
is

101
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,120
because

102
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
the insurance rates go up

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
the companies a lot of times are just

104
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,080
canceling saying well we can't afford

105
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,800
that

106
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
not able to do that

107
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
and then what they're realizing is oh

108
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,400
wait our contracts

109
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
require us

110
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
to have that

111
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,760
and so now they're in violation of their

112
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,080
contracts with their clients

113
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,519
and there's

114
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
a good push from a lot of financial

115
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,519
institutions right now

116
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
that are basically saying in their

117
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,480
contracts look if you don't have the

118
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,159
insurance if you don't meet the

119
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
if you don't also meet the minimum

120
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,120
security standards that we require as a

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
financial institution to be able to work

122
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,200
with us and be a third-party contractor

123
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,959
of us then guess what you're not getting

124
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,799
paid until that happens

125
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,159
and we're seeing more of that as well

126
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,760
right there can the

127
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
different organizations are controlling

128
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
in the contracts where you have to have

129
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
the insurance you have to do some

130
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
minimum security standards

131
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
which are really just best practices

132
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,239
right so that's kind of the main problem

133
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,560
there is that rates are going up

134
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,040
companies can't afford the new rates

135
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
what do you do that's what we're going

136
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
to talk about today

137
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
but before we do that let's talk about

138
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
the root cause of all this so why are

139
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,120
the rates going up we talked a little

140
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
bit about the risk factor there right so

141
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
really

142
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
what are the insurance companies looking

143
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,800
at

144
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
because they're not there every day with

145
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,080
you they're not sitting next to you your

146
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
team at on the computer they're not

147
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,880
sitting with the accounting team and

148
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,919
seeing what's happening there they're

149
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
not sitting with your security team and

150
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
seeing what's happening there so what

151
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
are they actually looking at well

152
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
they're looking at things like the

153
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
security posturing right and they're

154
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
looking at the external view that's what

155
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
they're getting a look at with things

156
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
like security scoring

157
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
i want to share a story with you

158
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
and

159
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
way way back in the day in my younger

160
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
years i had a different life right and i

161
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
was a medic in the military and i

162
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,600
volunteered at a boy scout camp with you

163
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
know variety of age ranges i think the

164
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
youngest was like six or seven whatever

165
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,000
the youngest in boy scouts is up until

166
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,479
teenage years and

167
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,080
one of the things i found is working

168
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,639
volunteering as a medic at that camp

169
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,600
was

170
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
the first couple of days the kids were

171
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,880
out there and they would be out there

172
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
for about a week and so the first couple

173
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
of days would be out there

174
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
all sorts of issues right especially

175
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
like on day one and day two like oh my

176
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
oh i got the stomach virus oh the pain

177
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
oh my arm hurts i've got this headache

178
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,440
that just don't won't go away et cetera

179
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,479
et cetera

180
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,120
and what i learned

181
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
is

182
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,080
that was just related to the fact they

183
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,840
were

184
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,000
homesick and once i realized that right

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,919
once i realized root cause i was able to

186
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,479
find a solution which in this case

187
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,160
was lemon drops and that's why you see

188
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
the lemon drops pictured there so what i

189
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
would do is every time a kid came oh my

190
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
stomach or my arm or something like that

191
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,759
and i would assess them of course and

192
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
say okay the vital signs are good and i

193
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
don't see anything wrong with their arm

194
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
and so i would be able to determine that

195
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,360
okay the actual cause here is just the

196
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
fact they're homesick they miss mom or

197
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
dad or both or or their friends or

198
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
whatever and so i would pull out my

199
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
magic pills is what i would call them i

200
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
said oh these are the these are the

201
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
magic pills and the magic pills

202
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,319
would help take away any pain you have

203
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,560
uh but you had to take one a day

204
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
don't double them up you might get sick

205
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
if you if you double them up you might

206
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
get sick even sicker just take one a day

207
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
and come back in a couple of days let me

208
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,840
know how you're doing and you know we'll

209
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
go from there if we need to send you the

210
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,919
hospital or something we'll do so then

211
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,199
now

212
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,479
when i started this at that camp

213
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
a few of the kids actually

214
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,759
they didn't realize these were lemon

215
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,280
drops so they were like oh this medicine

216
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
tastes great this is the greatest

217
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
medicine ever you know uh the problem

218
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
though is that the the kids would be

219
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,319
there a week and they were recycled

220
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,880
through and new kids would come but a

221
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,000
lot of the kids knew each other because

222
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,840
it was boy scouts right so

223
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,919
the next week kids started knowing that

224
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
the lemon that these were actually you

225
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,360
know just lemon drops and so

226
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,880
it still worked though the kids

227
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
understood that what i was trying to do

228
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
a lot of them did at the end there of

229
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
hey it's not a big deal right yes you're

230
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
away from home

231
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
but

232
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,039
this candy makes you feel better and

233
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,560
for those of us that eat candy we know

234
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
candy makes you feel better for the most

235
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
part on everything so

236
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,599
long story short there figured out the

237
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,440
root cause find a solution in this case

238
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,120
a delicious solution

239
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
but you can't always find the delicious

240
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,680
solution in the cyber world

241
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
so how are we doing things now well

242
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,479
guess what this is the magical

243
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
compliance checkbox and this is really

244
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
how the vast majority of organizations

245
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
are doing things because

246
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
board members are saying hey what are we

247
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
doing for compliance insurers are saying

248
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
what are you doing for compliance

249
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
your third parties and the your clients

250
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
are saying what are you doing for

251
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
compliance check the box check the box

252
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,800
check the box and that's what we're

253
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
doing

254
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
great at least we're doing something

255
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,039
right but

256
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,960
here's the downside of that let's go to

257
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
the threat actors

258
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
hey i'm a threat actor i know that your

259
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
company is just checking the compliance

260
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,160
box well guess what i know exactly how

261
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,759
to attack you now because i know exactly

262
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,879
what you're doing

263
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
and yes you might be doing a few things

264
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,319
outside of that but realistically i'm

265
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,240
going to get it in

266
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
so that's how we're doing it now let's

267
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,639
change that and this isn't focused on

268
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,400
you as you're in your organization you

269
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,560
might be doing awesome things but this

270
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
is a broad statement here that let's be

271
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,960
realistic a lot of companies are just

272
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,120
checking a box

273
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
so we're going to briefly talk about a

274
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
couple of case studies near the end of

275
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
this presentation and really just

276
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,759
talking about some of the things we

277
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
should be looking for so bank of ken

278
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,360
which by the way gives awesome loan

279
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,039
rates you can find the loan rates on the

280
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,559
dark web so just go search around there

281
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
you'll find that and click every link in

282
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,719
there and then meow hospital because

283
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
many people that know me

284
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
know i love cats and they love cats too

285
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
so i had to throw a cat picture in here

286
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
so meow hospital you can also go there

287
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
as well i have heard that

288
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
their

289
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
the the entrance to the hospital is

290
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,480
covered in litter so just fyi on that

291
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,920
so when we talk about the insurance

292
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
companies and we're going to focus this

293
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
a blended approach on this presentation

294
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
of insurance companies and the threat

295
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
actors so when we talk about insurance

296
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,200
companies what are they looking at right

297
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
they're looking at your security scoring

298
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,399
and there's a number of places that do

299
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
this security scorecard is one and

300
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
that's one that i i actually use and you

301
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,279
can sign up for a free account over

302
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
there and just get like a simple report

303
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
and monitor on

304
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,839
your organization you don't get like the

305
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,519
deep dive i don't think with a free

306
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,880
account but you can at least get some

307
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,200
insight into what your company's scoring

308
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
is right now or a company that you're

309
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,839
interested in

310
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
i will say that you basically it's one

311
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
email address to one account so if you

312
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
want to have multiple accounts this is a

313
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,160
workaround you could technically i'm not

314
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,279
telling you to do anything you could

315
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,040
technically create a few email addresses

316
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
and technically sign all of them up and

317
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
technically monitor different companies

318
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,279
so just fyi on that

319
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,560
again not telling you to do that but

320
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
that is a possible workaround that you

321
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,839
may try

322
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,600
so they look at security scoring and as

323
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,959
part of that again that's an external

324
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,399
view right so they're looking at things

325
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,160
like your third parties are there any

326
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
attacks going on with them so for

327
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,200
example if you were contracted with

328
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,760
solar winds and they're getting hit are

329
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
you at risk then does your risk go up

330
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,839
because of the third party contractual

331
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
agreements they're looking for external

332
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
vulnerabilities it might be things

333
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,079
you've already patched right and we'll

334
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,920
talk about what you need to do in that

335
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
case a little later also any any uh

336
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
hacker chatter and i put criminal hacker

337
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,079
here because hackers as we all know

338
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,360
there's a big

339
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
misperception in the media and stuff so

340
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,760
i don't like to jump on board that train

341
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
so criminal hacker here but that really

342
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
covers any nation state all that stuff

343
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
as well with that the word criminal that

344
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,920
i'm using there

345
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,959
so these are some of the things you're

346
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,320
looking at again the big thing to take

347
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
away here is the external view is really

348
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
what they're looking at

349
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,760
so what can you do

350
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,360
well know your security score i mean you

351
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
got to start someplace right you have to

352
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
know what they're seeing on their end

353
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,959
and then you can determine what you can

354
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,399
actually do about it

355
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
you also need to identify the pathways

356
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,880
to critical assets critical data your

357
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
critical services

358
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
because that's what the attackers are

359
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
going after they're not going to get

360
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
jimmy's excel spreadsheet on his desktop

361
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,079
unless that's something critical right

362
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,839
otherwise they could really care less

363
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,200
about that it's not a good use of their

364
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
time most attacks are usually

365
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,279
financially motivated or intelligence

366
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,519
gathering from nation state or state

367
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
sponsored groups

368
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
you also need to identify security

369
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
controls right so once you identify the

370
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
pathways to those critical

371
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,959
assets you also need to identify what

372
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,519
controls do we have in place right now

373
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,680
and what are we missing

374
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,120
right

375
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
and once we identify that then it's a we

376
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,839
have to go through a process of okay

377
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
we're missing these controls now what

378
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
can we put in place

379
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,399
and we have to basically do a trade-off

380
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
right we have to say okay yes this would

381
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
be the absolute best possible control we

382
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,120
could put in place but

383
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,519
man that thing's really expensive

384
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,279
or it takes a lot of

385
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,200
human resources to implement or it takes

386
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
a lot of time to roll out and we need

387
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
something quicker so there's always a

388
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,519
trade-off when you're assessing

389
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,959
different controls it could be a

390
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
financial cost could be just a resource

391
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,240
cost

392
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,639
could be the the ongoing cost right

393
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,480
maybe it's pretty easy to set it up and

394
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,279
get it going but maybe it's a long term

395
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,959
cost right maybe it's very expensive to

396
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,320
keep maintaining

397
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,000
that particular control in place maybe

398
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
it's very resource intensive to keep

399
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
maintaining that control as well so

400
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,279
there's always a trade off there that

401
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,240
you have to go through when you're

402
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
thinking through different security

403
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
controls the other thing there is

404
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,800
how can you maximize control right how

405
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,480
can you maximize security controls what

406
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
do i mean well once you have identified

407
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
the pathways where

408
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
where's a good spot in that pathway

409
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,639
right where where maybe it branches off

410
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,399
so thinking about for example like your

411
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,639
active directory infrastructure

412
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,600
where

413
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,839
does do things branch off you know from

414
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,760
your forest where you know where the

415
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
force is connected where do things

416
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,440
branch off and can you put a control in

417
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,560
place there

418
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
so it has maximum impact right so if i

419
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,600
put a so think of it like a a city with

420
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
roads right and so i've got all these

421
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,480
roads but there's only one way in and

422
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
out of the city it's across this bridge

423
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
so i could if i was trying to catch a

424
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,200
bank robber i could try to put a police

425
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
officer on every single street and try

426
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
to catch a bank robber that way

427
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
and you know assuming again that i know

428
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
the bank robbers

429
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,040
leaving trying to flee town or i could

430
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
just block off the bridge

431
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,639
right and that's maximum use of my

432
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,079
controls and i maybe i only need a

433
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,320
couple of officers to do that so that

434
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,079
way not all the officers are taking up

435
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
stopping the bank robber so that's what

436
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,440
i'm talking about there is once you've

437
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,760
identified the pathway and where the

438
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,600
threat actor may go

439
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
then figure out the maximum bang for

440
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
your buck so to speak on security

441
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,079
controls and implement those right and

442
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,279
again that's that's going to depend on

443
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,120
your organization and what you have set

444
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
up so that's something you actually need

445
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,040
to take away from this presentation as

446
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,399
an after action item to make sure that

447
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,399
you sit down with your team and you

448
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,000
start kind of plotting this out right

449
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,079
identify pathways to the critical assets

450
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,079
data services etc

451
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,320
then also from there identify what

452
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,680
controls you have in place to protect

453
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,959
those right now

454
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,040
and what you're missing and then from

455
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
there you can go through the activity of

456
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
prioritizing and doing the trade-off

457
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,760
analysis of those security controls

458
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,199
once you've identified all that stuff

459
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,639
and gotten all this stuff in place now

460
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
it's time to sell yourself and i don't

461
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,959
mean like go sell yourself

462
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,320
you're going to sell yourself your

463
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
company your security posture basically

464
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,880
to the insurance companies and say hey

465
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,199
wait a minute here yes this is a score

466
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
you're given trying to give us this rate

467
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,240
but

468
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,160
this is what we've done right this is

469
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,399
what we've we're this is what we've

470
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,000
recognized right

471
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,519
these are the things we're doing well

472
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,480
these are the things we're going to do

473
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,959
in the next 30 days 60 days 90 days six

474
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,040
months you know year 18 months whatever

475
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,000
you basically want to give them a

476
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,839
roadmap right show them like okay we're

477
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,279
doing this stuff now

478
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,040
we're patching these servers now for

479
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,360
example and we're going to patch that

480
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,880
web server that was showing some

481
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
vulnerabilities and then on top of that

482
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,959
30 days from now we're going to do this

483
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,720
or six months from now we're going to be

484
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,639
doing this and we're also doing this you

485
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,240
know 12 months down the line 18 months

486
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,600
down the line whatever you want to show

487
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
that roadmap because that allows them to

488
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,680
reduce the risk right just like if i had

489
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,959
a car

490
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,440
and i had a really bad insurance rate

491
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
quoted to me and i said but wait a

492
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,279
minute i have 12 letters of

493
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,720
recommendation

494
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,680
from

495
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,199
people i know that say i'm the best

496
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,519
driver ever i have video evidence

497
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,760
showing i'm the best driver ever and

498
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,320
what i'm going to do immediately is do

499
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
these things and and you know make sure

500
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,680
my hands are 10 and 2 and all these

501
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
things

502
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,639
and then from there in six months i'm

503
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,839
going to make sure that i've gone

504
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,000
through some additional training on

505
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
driving safely et cetera and then maybe

506
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
in the year in the year time frame i'm

507
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,519
gonna

508
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,880
get my

509
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
license to be able to drive semi trucks

510
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
so i've got additional training on

511
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,160
driving and safety and things like that

512
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,279
you're right so i'm just giving a road

513
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
map to the insurance company now i don't

514
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,920
know if that's going to work with the

515
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
car insurance you can try it let me know

516
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,759
but for these purposes

517
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,279
that's what we're trying to do for the

518
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
cyber security insurers

519
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,160
and as part of this process there's a

520
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,360
secondary benefit right of

521
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
being able to stop a lot of the threat

522
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,199
actors because now you're improving

523
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,959
security posture so you've identified

524
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,199
the pathways to your critical assets

525
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,199
you've identified how the threat actors

526
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,399
are likely going to go down those

527
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,720
pathways to get stuff and you've

528
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,399
identified controls you can put in place

529
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,839
well guess what you just stopped a lot

530
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,040
of the attacks that were going to be

531
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
happening on your company as long as you

532
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,639
actually implement things that you've

533
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,839
identified

534
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,079
so it's there's a secondary benefit here

535
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,160
in addition to what you know the board

536
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
and executive team would care about of

537
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,759
in reducing those insurance rates in the

538
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,160
financials the secondary benefit here to

539
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
the organization itself

540
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,600
is

541
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,759
now we have an improved security posture

542
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,680
we have a roadmap of things we need to

543
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,079
be doing and we can actually go execute

544
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,720
on that roadmap moving forward and that

545
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,519
will reduce our risk overall of threat

546
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,639
actors

547
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,000
getting in right we're just you know

548
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
again we're not going to keep anyone out

549
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
completely if someone wants to get in

550
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
they're going to get in but if we make

551
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,599
it more difficult with company a then

552
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,720
they're going to go over to company b

553
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
and bother them right and that's a whole

554
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,280
goal here

555
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,919
it's very similar to

556
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,079
you live next year well you obviously

557
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
live next door to your neighbor but

558
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
you let's say you have a fence you have

559
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
you know a couple of really big dogs you

560
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,199
have a security system alarm system you

561
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
you have a bunch of guns you have

562
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
cameras whatever right you have all

563
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
these things you have barbed wire all

564
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
these things and your neighbor has none

565
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,440
of that stuff right

566
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
if i'm a

567
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
person that likes to break into houses

568
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,640
whose house am i going to break into

569
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
well i'm going to go to your neighbor

570
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,360
right because that's easier that's path

571
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,960
of least resistance and that's most

572
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
threat actors want the passive path of

573
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
least resistance out there because a lot

574
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
of the these attacks are financially

575
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
motivated

576
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
so let's just talk quickly about the

577
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
bank of can and then meow hospital and

578
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,400
some of the things you should be looking

579
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
for so if you are a a bank or financial

580
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
institution

581
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,880
some of the things you should be just

582
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,840
kind of thinking about that might be

583
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,000
possible uh parts of your pathway right

584
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,840
so bank of can and this is just kind of

585
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
a real real life example that's based

586
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,320
off uh real real events just like a

587
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,720
movie but i i'm gonna change like ever

588
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
just about everything aside from the

589
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,799
fact international locations just so i

590
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,480
don't give any indicators away of

591
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
actually who this was but i worked with

592
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
a financial institution and it wasn't

593
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,240
actually a bank but financial

594
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,679
institution

595
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,200
that offered a software solution to

596
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
banks and other financial clients of

597
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,240
theirs

598
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
uh basically a cloud-based solution and

599
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,240
so that was one risk area significant

600
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,320
risk area that was getting flagged uh

601
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,919
international locations so they were in

602
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,600
an international and had actual physical

603
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,320
offices around the world and dealt in

604
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
different areas around the world

605
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,160
they stored a lot of sense of data in

606
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
public cloud environments which actually

607
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,000
is scary if you kind of think about that

608
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
and it was not secured properly so just

609
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,760
some of the things they had to keep in

610
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
mind when they went through the pathway

611
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,000
and security control activities

612
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,039
but

613
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
here's what happened with them initially

614
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
their insurance rates went through the

615
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
roof and after going through the the

616
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
process that i shared with you

617
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,400
previously

618
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
they were able to reduce the quotes and

619
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
everything and and uh you know working

620
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,039
through

621
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,559
identifying or at least last i knew

622
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,760
working through identifying the best

623
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,360
policy for them right but their rates

624
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
went down because they were able to show

625
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
that their security posture had improved

626
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
to the insurers and that was a critical

627
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,919
part on top of that they were able to as

628
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
part of the activity actually identify

629
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
some vulnerabilities they didn't know

630
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
about they had some say they had some

631
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,120
web servers out there they didn't

632
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,960
actually know about and so they were

633
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,039
able to secure their improvement improve

634
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,440
their security posture overall

635
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
and then meow hospital and this is also

636
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,440
based on on real life events so mia

637
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,799
hospital

638
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
uh was actually a healthcare

639
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,440
organization that was hit with

640
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,799
ransomware

641
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
so when

642
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
we see a lot about okay patient records

643
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
system systems are locked out they can't

644
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
treat patients they can't get the data

645
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,400
whatever that's one facet of these

646
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
healthcare attacks but there are many

647
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,799
other aspects that probably don't make

648
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,480
the news so much right so obviously we

649
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
know the emr ehr systems and that's

650
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,039
electronic medical record systems or

651
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,640
electronic healthcare

652
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
electronic health record systems so emrs

653
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,080
you usually see in like doctors offices

654
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,919
and smaller organizations usually

655
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,799
hospitals use ehr and really a lot of i

656
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,159
mean these days things are just kind of

657
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,000
blended right you're just it's patient

658
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,360
record system essentially there's some

659
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
different features on both which we

660
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
won't dive into

661
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
patient data is one aspect that a lot of

662
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
people think about like okay all the

663
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
patient data the doctor can't see what

664
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
happened with your blood pressure last

665
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
week but

666
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,159
what about the employee data in these

667
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
events right it doesn't mean that the

668
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,000
data for employees is not going to be

669
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,840
compromised and in fact with the

670
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
ransomware attack i mentioned the

671
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
employee data was compromised as well

672
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
right they literally got like everything

673
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
and this was an organization still

674
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,039
running like some windows 2000 windows

675
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,679
95 stuff yeah i know that's scary right

676
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,240
and so naturally of course they were

677
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
an easy target

678
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,679
and the other thing here medical devices

679
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,600
so not just like pacemakers

680
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
defibrillators i've actually

681
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,520
uh with testing many years ago when i

682
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,039
worked as a pen tester in healthcare i

683
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,880
actually turned off a defibrillator

684
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,400
remotely and this is back when they were

685
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,080
just starting to do the remote

686
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
monitoring of pacemakers and

687
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,840
defibrillators nowadays it's commonplace

688
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,640
but

689
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
i showed how you how i could turn off

690
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
the defibrillator feature

691
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
where it would just be a pacemaker and

692
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,679
show the vendor that and so the vendor

693
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,240
went back and uh fortunately for them

694
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,799
and kudos to them for fixing the issue

695
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,880
in the code but medical devices and not

696
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
just pacemakers defibrillators but

697
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,679
infusion pumps

698
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,840
your x-ray equipment all sorts of

699
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
equipment in the hospital

700
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
if you've ever gone to the even the

701
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
dentist office there's just so many

702
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
things to play with there's just so many

703
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
things that you can attack it's just

704
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,960
crazy

705
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,039
the number of devices you can attack and

706
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,440
most of them are extremely vulnerable so

707
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
when we when you're healthcare

708
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
organization you really need to consider

709
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,000
what are all the entry points here not

710
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,240
just what's the typical entry point of

711
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,159
you know susan in accounting clicks a

712
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,640
link in an email but how else some might

713
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,960
somebody attack and what's the actual

714
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
impact financially as well as the human

715
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,840
life

716
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
because if you turn off a defibrillator

717
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
on someone and they need that shock to

718
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,960
take them out of ventricular

719
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,320
fibrillation which is basically just

720
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,679
where your heart's like

721
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,400
you know all day long type of thing

722
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
and it's very dangerous and that's in

723
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,000
the lower chambers of your heart

724
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,679
but if it's if it's fibrillating like

725
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,120
that and you don't have a defibrillator

726
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,520
to shock you back into a normal rhythm

727
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,600
for your heart the person can literally

728
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,400
die

729
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,039
they literally in some cases may dr

730
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
essentially drown

731
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,200
their heart may drown in in blood

732
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
and so

733
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,919
these are real things these are real

734
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,520
things that can happen and these have

735
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,039
been vulnerabilities around for years so

736
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
that's another consideration and the

737
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,120
last one here that people seem to forget

738
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
about is communication

739
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,799
so what happens when someone attacks

740
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,880
communication of the hospital so code

741
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,039
blue is a code called when

742
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,799
it's a life and death situation in the

743
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,559
hospital and so somebody may be going

744
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,400
into cardiac arrest or

745
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
or it may be suspected that they are or

746
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,200
something

747
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
and so that basically calls a special

748
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
team in most hospitals where they come

749
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,440
running doctors nurses etc as well as

750
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,559
the local

751
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,400
team and by local i mean i just mean on

752
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
the unit itself so there's a number of

753
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
people that come running to save the day

754
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
but what happens if they can't ever get

755
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
that call and you're laying in the

756
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,919
hospital bed or your grandma is or your

757
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,640
your other loved one and

758
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
you can't they're calling cold blue on

759
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
the floor but that communication is not

760
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
going anywhere no one's able to hear

761
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
that guess what grandma dies that's

762
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
unfortunate but that's reality so the

763
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,360
communication is one other thing on

764
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,600
hospitals that a lot of people forget

765
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,919
about but that's a key one as well what

766
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,159
happens when people shut that down so

767
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,600
all considerations you need to think

768
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
about and these are just a couple of

769
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
different use cases there

770
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,080
now that particular healthcare

771
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,240
organization that this use case is based

772
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,120
on

773
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,880
uh they they wasn't around cyber

774
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
insurance or anything but it was around

775
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,320
the throat actor angle and so they were

776
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,520
able to actually improve their security

777
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,039
posture over time

778
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,000
and

779
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
mitigate a lot of future attacks because

780
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,000
they had they really got they really got

781
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,320
pwned they really really got prone with

782
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,880
that organization

783
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,400
so i just want to open it up now to any

784
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
questions throw those in the chat so

785
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
kind of a brief presentation here but

786
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
the main takeaways here are

787
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,520
go look at your security scoring if you

788
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
if you don't have that already just

789
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,200
again security score card is just one

790
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
but that's the one i like to use

791
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,520
personally

792
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,120
go there sign up for a free account you

793
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,520
can usually get a free account just pull

794
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,880
up your company

795
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,559
it usually free account won't let you

796
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,320
deep dive it'll just show you the the

797
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,640
very ten thousand foot level but take a

798
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,720
look at that identify kind of the major

799
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
areas and say okay let's go let's either

800
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,799
number one pay for a security score card

801
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,720
or another service and and see the

802
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
deeper dive or let's just take this

803
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
information on these top level things

804
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,799
go back to the drawing board and start

805
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,080
working through the process of

806
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,320
identifying what are our critical assets

807
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,799
critical data services etc

808
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,240
in these areas

809
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,679
and then on top of that what are the

810
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,600
pathways to those

811
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,679
how might a threat actor go go through

812
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,880
those who are the threat actors

813
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,520
targeting us usually based on our our

814
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,039
type of industry and where we are

815
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,120
geographically in the world and then

816
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,640
what controls do we have in place right

817
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,039
now to protect against attack

818
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,799
and then finally

819
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,240
with that part

820
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
what controls will be missing and then

821
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,840
you need to do that trade-off analysis

822
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,919
this is not a hour-long process by the

823
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,279
way this is something you need to take

824
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,559
back it's going to take you probably a

825
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,960
couple weeks at least as an organization

826
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,039
to to go through as a team and get work

827
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,320
through these things

828
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,679
but these are the things that you need

829
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,520
to be doing and then once you've

830
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,159
determined that stuff then you can work

831
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:38,960
on

832
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
with insurers if you're trying to reduce

833
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
your rate or whatever you can work on

834
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,039
positioning yourself better and saying

835
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,559
okay this is kind of our roadmap of what

836
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
we're going to do and even if you're not

837
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,159
trying to improve your insurance rates

838
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,360
let's say your rate stayed the same

839
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,840
you've been fortunate that's cool this

840
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,159
process though will help you improve

841
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,240
your security posture overall and so

842
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,679
you'll be able to finally have a road

843
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,240
map essentially to go take these to the

844
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
executive team and that also helps you

845
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,679
with budget right we all scream about i

846
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,120
need more budget i need cyber security

847
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,480
budget we don't get enough budget blah

848
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,640
blah blah well that's great how are you

849
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
positioning that to executives right

850
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
they only care about the the numbers

851
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
right honestly i'm an executive i'm

852
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,880
telling you i only care about the

853
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,760
numbers

854
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
and so you need to communicate that and

855
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,559
this is an easy way for you to do that

856
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,400
if you're a more technical person

857
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
more practical more practitioner type of

858
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,480
person and less political business type

859
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
of person then this is a great way to

860
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,840
show

861
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,080
exactly what you need to be doing and

862
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,919
the cost of everything and the cost

863
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,400
financially resource-wise etc

864
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,799
and you just present that information

865
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,279
to the the stakeholders the leadership

866
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,200
and say hey this is this is kind of the

867
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,159
plan

868
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,240
and we need your input and if you want

869
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,760
to do some of these things you need to

870
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,360
give us more money right you need to

871
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
give us some more money i need more

872
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
money pay me right

873
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
so it allows you to go get more budget

874
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,960
and everything as well so there's a lot

875
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,279
of benefits to doing this process

876
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,840
and you need to do it right because

877
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,679
again as we talked about

878
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,039
in the beginning

879
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,080
most organizations are checking the box

880
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,520
don't be like them

881
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
if you're just checking a box right now

882
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,760
then go through this process

883
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,960
again

884
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,039
this can benefit you multiple ways it

885
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,559
can help secure your organization a

886
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,799
little bit better it can help improve

887
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,960
insurance rates and reduce rates on that

888
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
it can also help you land contracts

889
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
because if other businesses are seeing

890
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,240
that you're

891
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,760
doing the things you need to be doing

892
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
and your competitor isn't

893
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,320
i've actually won contracts before

894
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,840
because of that and even though my rate

895
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,399
was higher i won the contract because

896
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,919
they noticed that the competitor wasn't

897
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,120
doing what they need they should be

898
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
doing so all this stuff can benefit your

899
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
organization this is part of pivoting

900
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,279
the mindset out there that security is

901
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,440
just a cost-centered focus

902
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
we're trying to pivot the mindset here

903
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,039
to where it's a financial benefit for

904
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,960
the organization to improve that

905
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,559
security posture

906
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,720
so again if there's any questions at all

907
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
throw them in the chat real quick here

908
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,200
and we'll get them answered for you

909
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
