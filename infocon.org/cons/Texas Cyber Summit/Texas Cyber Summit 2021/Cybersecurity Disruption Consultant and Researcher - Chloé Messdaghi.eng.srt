4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,400
industry that keeps it insecure and

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,799
risky and i'm very excited to talk about

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,880
this because it's something close to my

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,680
heart about burnout but also i get to

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,240
touch about how our industry could

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,720
really use some help right now on making

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,800
things better for everyone

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
on how to reduce burnout and i just want

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,279

burnout is not

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
caused by you it's not about self-care

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,399
anymore it is about how we are

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
in this certain system that we are

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
placed in and how it keeps causing us to

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
get burned out which i'm going to touch

20

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,079
now let's get into the real reason why

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,039
you're here today

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,520
i just want to say that you may be here

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
right now

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,759
let's be honest with one another

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
the pandemic

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
there was no guide on how to survive it

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,520
and we're still in a pandemic

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,799
and we are on a fine line of just being

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,840
okay

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,399
and not being okay

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,239
and we've been dealing with burnout even

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,360
before the

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
pandemic within our industry so that's

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
why it's important for us to talk about

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,920
this because even if when the pandemic

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,000
is over we still have to address this

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
with burnout we do place ourselves an

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,920
organization at a security risk we're

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,720
more likely to click on a link um

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,680
because we're not 100 who we are because

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,640
our

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
we are not a full completely battery in

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
a sense so we're going to make a lot

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,120
more mistakes

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,920
we may not even patch correctly we may

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
be overwhelmed of what is needed to be

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
patched

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,599
but also let's be real

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,560
sometimes us being insecurity

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
people see us as kind of like robots and

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,360
not humans um and this is one of the

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
things is that within security itself

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,120
we're expected to work 24 7 and always

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,239
be at the edge of our seat 24 7 because

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,120
that is what's expected of us is to work

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,840
all hours and be expected to be on calls

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,360
at all hours because security is 24 7.

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,319
so

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,159
at the end of the day is how do you even

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,720
balance a personal life and work life

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
because the reality is is that if we're

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
not balancing our work and personal life

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,720
that's when we start having burnout

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,599
because that balance is gone

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,239
so you may even see signs of it such as

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,120
like

88
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,400
uh

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
you've noticed changes with your

90
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
colleagues even with yourself uh they

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
may be withdrawn or fast to become angry

92
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,920
and sad

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,480
you might see delay and responses or

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,239
projects and this could be seen remote

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
too you don't have to actually be in

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
person to know if someone's burned out

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,560
or not

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,239
but this is the thing is to understand

99
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,519
is that since we've been remote

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,120
and also since we've been working from

101
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
home in the pandemic the thing is is

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,879
that it's incredibly hard to put a line

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,840
in the sand saying this is my work time

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
this is my personal time and putting

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,200
boundaries down because it's almost

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,358
impossible in the past to have

107
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,079
boundaries when you work in security

108
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
but the thing is is that i think at this

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,199
point

110
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,880
we are starting to realize if we don't

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,680
put down boundaries or not practicing

112
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,560
more balancing at work and personal life

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
we end up getting burned out and the

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
effects can be really bad

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
and for those that aren't aware of how

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,919
bad burnout can start forming and

117
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,199
looking like

118
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,600
it used to be that it took a few minutes

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
to respond to an email now it takes

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,840
hours or days you may feel exhausted and

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,880
trapped

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
you might even feel empty you may push

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
yourself to like this breaking point and

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
it's almost impossible to come up with

125
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,479
new ideas or new strategies and then you

126
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,120
start getting some aches here and there

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
as well

128
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,639
you get overly anxious over events and

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,039
deadlines you can get angry or you can

130
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,280
get sad very fast

131
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,560
and the other thing is that you may even

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,039
not respond to your friends and family

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,360
at you know at a certain time not

134
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
because you're busy it's because

135
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
you're worried that that's gonna be

136
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
another task on top of everything and

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
that's when you start having this guilt

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
that comes in

139
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,479
and when that guilt starts coming in

140
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,240
it's reminding you that your personal

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
life is now slipping your work has

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
become your life

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
and then when your life is your work you

144
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,880
start feeling under appreciated for

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
everything that you have given up to be

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,919
in that role or where you work

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,800
and then you get resentful at your work

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
now when you get resentful this ends up

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,160
being this change of hating and dreading

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
going to your job this is the moment

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
that you do lose team members so burnout

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,160
is something very very serious

153
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
and it's not just that but also when we

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
don't address burnout this can happen to

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,039
your body you're going to feel exhausted

156
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,880
you're going to struggle to sleep you

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
can you'll start mimicking the same

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,680
symptoms as anxiety and depression

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
you'll start noticing that you get sick

160
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,840
more often your muscles get tight and

161
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,440
sore you might get more headaches

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,840
suddenly or

163
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,680
gastrointestinal issues as well

164
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
and

165
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,440
cardiovascular problems increase so this

166
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,039
gives you a higher

167
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,280
chance of

168
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
the stress that's been prolonged for too

169
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,160
long so you have

170
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
high blood pressure and heart attacks

171
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,919
and strokes

172
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,600
um because there's too much adrenaline

173
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,840
corsal in your body over an extended

174
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
time

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
so burnout is not a joke it is something

176
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,840
serious and no matter how much you push

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
it and you don't want to address it the

178
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,479
thing is

179
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,960
it will hit you and when it does it will

180
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
hit you hard

181
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,759
so the thing is is why are we burnt out

182
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,720
within our industry like i said before

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,960
we operate 24 7 around the clock and

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,479
even in the middle of night that means

185
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,960
if i get a phone call at two or three in

186
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
the morning that means i need to take

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,280
that phone call because it's important

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
because i don't want to put anyone at

189
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,759
risk and neither do you so that's the

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,680
thing it's like we're always around the

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
clock it's very hard to ever have a

192
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
moment of just relaxing or

193
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,680
whether or not

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
what is the call going to happen that

195
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,360
there's a breach

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
um because the thing is attackers they

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,319
go at all hours and we're always knowing

198
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,639
that a breach is going to occur it will

199
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,599
occur eventually we just don't know when

200
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,840
and this is the

201
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,599
thing we're also really scared when

202
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
there is a breach because we know that

203
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
is most likely going to be an ad hoc

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,160
style to fix it

205
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,919
because the reality is according to the

206
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,599
opponent institute while security

207
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,840
response planning is slowly improving

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
year after year that the vast majority

209
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
of organizations

210
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
74 of them

211
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,080
reported not having

212
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
any incident response plan or having an

213
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
ad hoc plan

214
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
when it comes to having a breach

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,199
this also means that those that did have

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
plans in the first place

217
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
um they didn't have any time of when

218
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
they're going to review or when they

219
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,240
were going to

220
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
test them out or revisit them at a date

221
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,319
and this is really scary for us because

222
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,159
well we don't have up-to-date plans

223
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,240
how how are we

224
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
it's the the just amount of stress and

225
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,039
weight on our shoulders of

226
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,919
how are we going to deal with this when

227
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
this crisis happens so this is why it's

228
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
important if we put more attention

229
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
towards preparing and prevention we have

230
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,880
a better chance of feeling like more

231
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
we're a little bit less stressed

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,320
but this also allows us to know that if

233
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,959
we are burned out and we have a call

234
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
saying that there is a breach

235
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
we have a procedure that's intact that

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
we can actually utilize

237
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
now the other thing is is that 94

238
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
percent of the forbes 2000 list still

239
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
don't have vulnerability disclosure

240
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
policies so this is another hard thing

241
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
for

242
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,839
having security plans is that if you

243
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,279
don't have security strategy that

244
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,160
doesn't incorporate having a bug bounty

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
program and or a vulnerability

246
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
disclosure policies

247
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,160
it is a horrible situation because the

248
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
thing is there's too much reliance on a

249
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
security team and we need diverse eyes

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,440
to find bugs so then

251
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,399
we're able to fix it but it also is one

252
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,200
of those things that we have to come

253
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,080
to this point in our industry is that we

254
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,920
need to build a bridge between the

255
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,959
hacker community and the companies

256
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,720
because the reality is if we don't build

257
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
that bridge we're going to keep having

258
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
these situations and we could have

259
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,800
avoided many breaches

260
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,360
if we had those programs set up

261
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
and of course what we tend to do in our

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
industry is that

263
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
we forget about that there's a human

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
element at play so what we do is we

265
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
throw tools hoping that that's gonna fix

266
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,839
the situation

267
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
um and and what i mean by that is that

268
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,040
right now organizations use more than 45

269
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
different security tools

270
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,440
and you don't even know how much you can

271
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
trust that

272
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
but also usually our incident response

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
plan coordination

274
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,480
has approximately 19 tools as well now

275
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
are those tools updated

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,480
how secure are those tools

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
were there more tools added to them

278
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
because remember

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
most of the plans that we have already

280
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,320
don't exist or they're out of date the

281
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
other thing is that more tools part of

282
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
the process means that there's gonna be

283
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,959
a slower remediation time and it's gonna

284
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,120
cost more money

285
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
and let me paint a picture of how

286
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,320
stressful this situation is for security

287
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,399
team now

288
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
i want you to imagine that you're on

289
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
a crew and you're on this cruise ship

290
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,839
and you just found out that your ship is

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
sinking but you found a little bit late

292
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,279
because you weren't alerted by your

293
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,680
system on time

294
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
your customers are bored

295
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,079
and they're trusting you for their

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,120
safety

297
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
now the one thing to remember is that

298
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
your team is a bit scared this is a

299
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
brand new situation even though they've

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
practiced multiple times on what to do

301
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
in this situation the thing is is that

302
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,120
they're scared because they're suddenly

303
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
in the heat of the moment

304
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,279
but the thing to also keep in mind is

305
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,839
that there is this fear

306
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,959
of failing that can paralyze people too

307
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,800
when they're in uh

308
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
you know when they're dealing with a

309
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,160
crisis

310
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,720
so the thing to keep in mind here is

311
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,600
that your team your crew is trying their

312
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
best to keep everything afloat and to

313
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
make sure that everyone is going to be

314
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,240
okay with the ship going down

315
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
now there is a catch here

316
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,880
your team hasn't really slept well um

317
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
they also feel a little seasick so you

318
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
could kind of say that they're

319
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
kind of processing and operating as if

320
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,920
they have burnout in other words they're

321
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
not exactly 100 state of mind

322
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,720
and this is something to keep in mind

323
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
so now you have the backstory

324
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
now i want you to imagine your captain

325
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,519
pulls out the safety binder

326
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,839
to know what is the protocol for this

327
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,200
ship

328
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
but unfortunately that binder

329
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,440
that was updated is not on that ship at

330
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
all so you're using an old procedure but

331
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,639
have new features to the ship and your

332
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,880
team is burned out in a sense because

333
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
they're seasick and they're paralyzed by

334
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,519
the fear of failing are you stressed out

335
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,880
now because this is what it's like

336
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,160
when we deal with bad plans and when the

337
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,399
human element is taken out it leaves you

338
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,519
with a wreckage literally

339
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,440
the truth is is that bad actors are

340
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
everywhere and they take all hours and

341
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
zero days drop often and we constantly

342
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
need to be up to date of what bad actors

343
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,480
use this takes time and energy and this

344
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,079
is why we're struggling because we're

345
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,760
part of a crew

346
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,959
but

347
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,959
we don't function well or communicate

348
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
well it could become a really scary

349
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,600
situation and the reason is that we are

350
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
insecurity

351
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,399
because we know it's incredibly

352
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
important to protect one another

353
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,040
and the other thing is to keep in mind

354
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
is that we've also come to terms that we

355
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,199
work around the clock and we don't even

356
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,440
have time to practice self-care because

357
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,240
of the demand and the stress of where

358
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,399
what we're doing

359
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,360
so

360
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
you have to understand where we come to

361
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,800
a place in our career we might be like

362
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,959
what is the point of this

363
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,079
if our employer isn't helping us or our

364
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,959
industry isn't changing how are we going

365
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,719
to change things in a sense

366
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,839
and this is why burnout matters is that

367
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,120
if we keep turning to tools and we don't

368
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
find the time to digest the human

369
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,959
element of this that is in play

370
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
we're never going to be able to get

371
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
where we want to go with our security

372
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,920
team and that is the reason why

373
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
we also need to rely on the hacker

374
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,959
community because the reality is the

375
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,120
hacker community is going to find the

376
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
bugs your security team cannot find

377
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
and this is important to note because

378
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,079
it's better to have the hacker committee

379
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,760
find those vulnerabilities than an

380
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
attacker to get a hold of that

381
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,760
vulnerability and not report it to you

382
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
and take advantage of you you don't want

383
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,839
to breach right none of us want to

384
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,519
breach that's why we're in this in the

385
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,880
first place

386
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
and that's why we have to understand

387
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,199
something which is

388
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,839
we cannot overly rely on our security

389
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,120
teams to find all the bugs

390
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760
because the reality is that your team is

391
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,720
most likely burned out at some point or

392
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
at least one person is going to be

393
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,360
burned out on your team at all times

394
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
and so this is the thing is is that we

395
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,279
need to understand that having

396
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,760
vulnerability disclosure policies and

397
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,399
bug bounty programs are incredibly

398
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
important to our strategy when it comes

399
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
to security

400
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
but also

401
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
it allows us to

402
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,320
partner with individuals that are trying

403
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,079
to help us

404
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,320
in other words

405
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,600
now the thing i want to just say is that

406
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
when you do have a bug bounty of honor

407
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
really disclosure policies in place it's

408
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,959
so incredibly important that you have

409
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,440
someone who can manage inquiries and

410
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,920
delegate bugs and also can be on top of

411
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,480
communicating and this is why having a

412
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
bug bounty program such as hacker one

413
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,839
it's incredibly important to have that

414
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,399
it makes it easier for communicating for

415
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
finding and fixing those bugs faster

416
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
than ever which does keep you protected

417
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,519
from attackers

418
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,320
now

419
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
for the bug bounty hunters that are

420
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
listening to this

421
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,680
first of all thank you for doing what

422
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,199
you do because we need you at the end of

423
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,399
the day we need you even if

424
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,079
organizations don't have vulnerability

425
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,920
disclosure policies or a bug batting

426
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,839
program they will one day

427
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,399
because they will realize they need you

428
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,199
too

429
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,440
we can't always rely on our own team we

430
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,839
have to get outside help

431
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,839
now the thing i can tell

432
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,160
from your perspective is that the

433
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
reality is that

434
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,399
we can put in so many hours to find bugs

435
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
and there comes no point where we don't

436
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,240
find things for weeks and months and

437
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
this can be alarming and this can be

438
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,440
scary and the reality is that sometimes

439
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
we just need to take a break

440
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,880
taking a break from everything from

441
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
infosec and then coming back a week

442
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,279
later you'll feel a lot more refreshed

443
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,119
but the thing is is that bug bounty

444
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,919
hunters it's it's a lot of hours and

445
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,520
dedication if you're doing this full

446
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
time and especially if you're doing this

447
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,119
part-time and having a full-time

448
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,839
security job it's a lot of work so

449
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
trying to find time to balance that

450
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
personal life is also really hard

451
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,520
but the other thing is stressful is like

452
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,079
waiting for the communication

453
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,559
like there it could be terrible i'll be

454
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,960
honest there's delays and expectations a

455
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
conflict all the time when trying to get

456
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,120
paid out or getting an update on the bug

457
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,840
that you submitted and this can be also

458
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
very stressful and when we have so much

459
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
stress that isn't being dealt with this

460
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,720
ends up turning into burnout

461
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
so it's really important that

462
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,720
when we report to an organization is for

463
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,039
us to both understand

464
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,720
that

465
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,840
we're all

466
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
part of a situation and we all have

467
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,360
wants and desires and it's also a really

468
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,559
stressful to be in this industry

469
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,160
and i want to talk about that a little

470
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,799
bit further into this conversation

471
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,039
but first i just want to say is that

472
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,960
overall i hope

473
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
from the beginning of this conversation

474
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
is that everyone's pretty much burned

475
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,799
out at some point or at this very moment

476
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,200
and that is the reality of everything is

477
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,440
that with coven 19 we're taking care of

478
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
family members we're on camera daily

479
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
we're unable to leave our home sometimes

480
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
we can't see our friends and family and

481
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,679
some of us live alone some of us put off

482
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,160
some really important life events

483
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,799
and some of us have lost people because

484
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,640
of the pandemic

485
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
and our colleagues are struggling we're

486
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,400
struggling some of us are worried at

487
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,799
keeping a job some of us are doing bug

488
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,880
bounty for a living

489
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,320
because

490
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,120
we are trying every way possible to get

491
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
funds in our pocket

492
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,760
it's a very weird time

493
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,799
and the thing is it's okay to be honest

494
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,919
and say

495
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,919
now let's be honest with one another is

496
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,280
that

497
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
we can't keep doing everything all the

498
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
time and that's okay

499
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
but the thing is is that

500
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
we have to figure this out as an

501
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,000
industry of how to do something better

502
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
because the human element creates

503
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
security and runs on security and we're

504
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
all struggling right now to a certain

505
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,160
extent so

506
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,640
let's change this problem and dive into

507
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
five investments that we can do

508
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,640
so first things first listen and take

509
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,840
action together be strong be kind

510
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,799
ask your team what do they need don't

511
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,280
just listen and and then

512
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
you know not take actions the thing is

513
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
we have to take actions so listen to one

514
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,400
another and try to get a good idea of

515
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,960
what you can do to help out the

516
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
situation

517
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
and because that is the reality of

518
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,120
what's going on is that even on secure

519
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,559
teams we're not being able to

520
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,120
communicate what is needed

521
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,039
it might be like hey we don't need this

522
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,559
tool anymore there's this other tool

523
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
that does three things in one

524
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,840
it could also be about trying to get

525
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,799
uh helping your cso out to go to the

526
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,480
board to push for vulnerability

527
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,240
disclosure policies or to get funds um

528
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
to even invest in the security team and

529
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,360
you know and that's the reality is is

530
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,919
asking people around you how can you

531
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,880
help

532
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
because the reality is that we kind of

533
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
have to work together to kind of get out

534
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,200
of this mess

535
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,280
like i said listening to one another and

536
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
taking action is definitely important

537
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
but also planning together so if you're

538
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
on a security team it's really important

539
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,240
is to

540
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
create strategies and revisit your

541
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,799
security response plan making sure that

542
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,720
it's up to date and also just keep on

543
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
remembering

544
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
that you know if a tool is added or

545
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,559
removed that should be updated in your

546
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
incident response plan if there's a team

547
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
member change that should be updating

548
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
your incident response plan if there's

549
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,919
environment change such as everyone's

550
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
working from home now that needs to be

551
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,600
updating your incident response plan

552
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
it's so important that we have solid

553
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,520
plans because this does reduce the

554
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,000
stress of when a breach occurs that we

555
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
have a game plan in a sense

556
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
you owe it to yourselves you owe it to

557
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,559
your team your colleagues your

558
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,520
organization even your customers

559
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,200
now the one thing i want to also say is

560
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
that you also do have to practice

561
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
certain self-care which is if you're

562
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,039
starting to feel burned out it's time to

563
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,320
take time off that means

564
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,480
take time off that means

565
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
not being on social media that means

566
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,080
getting off of your computer your

567
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,240
devices that means taking a whole week

568
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
off because studies have shown if you

569
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
want to deal with burnout and get rid of

570
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,520
burnout take a whole week off

571
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,320
and

572
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,799
don't do anything work related it's

573
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,559
really important that's the only way

574
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,120
that you can recover believe it or not

575
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
is to do that and to make changes in

576
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,480
your workplace or your home life so just

577
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,559
keep that in mind

578
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,320
and i know that it's

579
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,960
very scary to take time off because

580
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
sometimes we're afraid if we take time

581
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
off that our teammates are going to have

582
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
to pick up our work or we're going to be

583
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,640
afraid that we're going to be coming

584
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
back to a dumpster fire so it's really

585
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,360
important to understand is

586
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,280
we need to take time off regardless

587
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,919
because even if you are not taking time

588
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
off and you're burned out chances are

589
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,799
you're going to impact someone else

590
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
or some other team or some other

591
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,600
organization because you're not able to

592
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
properly do what you can do if you

593
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
weren't burned out

594
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,840
now the other thing to keep in mind is

595
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
that this also means reducing your

596
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
meetings if you have meetings have one

597
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,360
day off a week for meetings

598
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,640
so then we can play catch up in a sense

599
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,799
now the other thing i would say is

600
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,480
investment number four is have a

601
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
vulnerability disclosure

602
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,799
policies and have or

603
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,720
an or okay and or a bug bounty program

604
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
i mean it if you are if you care about

605
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,919
your security at your organization

606
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,200
have one but also not just have one but

607
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,400
also make sure that it is managed well

608
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,880
and what i mean by that is

609
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,760
having effective communications between

610
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
the hackers that are submitting the bugs

611
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,640
and your organization's response it is

612
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,720
so important that we have better

613
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,280
communication across the parties because

614
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,360
that's one of the reasons why

615
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,559
it can be very stressful to participate

616
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,960
so it's really important is to just make

617
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
sure that it's managed well have it

618
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
really structured well

619
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,159
and

620
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,039
really

621
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
really try your best and get feedback

622
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,360
from the hacker so say like how can we

623
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,039
do better next time

624
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,360
ask them they love to respond and tell

625
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
you about that and also

626
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
hackers

627
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
feel free to reach out to them and ask

628
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,840
them how can i do better next time how

629
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,799
can i improve my communication or how

630
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,240
can i do better and i think that's the

631
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
one thing that we can always do is just

632
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,080
ask how can i do better

633
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
now i want to just take this moment here

634
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,159
to just talk really quick on this one

635
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,559
investment number five is be kind and

636
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,678
respect boundaries

637
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,679
we have to just understand delays and

638
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,080
expectations are in conflict all the

639
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,559
time in bug bounty world and also when

640
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,960
we're reporting vulnerabilities but it's

641
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
really really important is to understand

642
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
to be kind to one another because we

643
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
don't know what the other person's going

644
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,159
through

645
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,679
and it's really important that we need

646
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,600
to start practicing empathy a little bit

647
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,400
more is to try to understand what their

648
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
situation is like so we can understand

649
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
one another

650
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
because by having empathy this also

651
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,159
helps reduce our stress but also this

652
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,039
allows us to

653
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,640
you know in the end kind of reduce that

654
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,279
burn out here and there or reduce the

655
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,360
possibility of getting burned out

656
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
and what i mean by is like

657
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,279
when it comes to submitting bugs

658
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,320
and you're waiting to hear back

659
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,960
please don't harass them

660
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
what i mean by that is don't contact

661
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
them on their social media that means

662
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,080
don't dm them on their twitter or

663
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,600
linkedin or their facebook or instagram

664
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,159
what i mean by that is understand that

665
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,760
it is their job and they don't work 24

666
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,840
around the clock they have

667
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,240
boundaries they work between nine to

668
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,360
five

669
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
in a certain time zone and that the

670
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,240
weekends they don't want to work

671
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,880
um and it's really understanding to

672
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
understand this whole

673
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,640
situation is

674
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,840
please respect

675
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,679
boundaries it is their job but they also

676
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,480
have a personal life outside of work

677
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
and respect that

678
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,200
so

679
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,919
when you do have communication with them

680
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,159
what you can do is ask

681
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
when should i follow up

682
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,440
and i like this question quite a bit

683
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
because when they ask me that question

684
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
when should i follow up

685
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,600
i can give them an idea of like

686
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,279
reach out in two weeks or reach out

687
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,600
within seven days

688
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,760
and this really helps the conversation

689
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,440
because then you just mark it in your

690
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
calendar and then you

691
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,559
write back to them on that day if you

692
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,279
haven't heard back or an update

693
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,400
other thing is that if you are

694
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
basically following up with a hacker

695
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
that has submitted a vulnerability it's

696
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,720
important to understand that

697
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,880
for some bug bounty and hunting is their

698
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,400
income

699
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,200
so

700
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
please understand if they're like hey i

701
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
haven't been paid out yet

702
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,320
understand that to them getting paid is

703
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
really important

704
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,720
because for some is their main income

705
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
and also it doesn't matter the thing is

706
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
if they've paid and you've accepted this

707
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,159
bug

708
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,559
they they need to get paid out

709
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,880
the other thing to keep in mind is that

710
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
language and culture does play a role

711
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,679
we're all around the world we're all

712
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,640
different

713
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,120
so it's important to be kind in your

714
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,480
responses

715
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,559
but also

716
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,120
be as transparent as possible

717
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,360
but also to provide a time frame for

718
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,760
them this also helps with you when they

719
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,679
try to come back and to follow up with

720
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,640
some updates

721
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,159
so here's a quick slide of what you can

722
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,840
do right now to reduce burnout

723
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,120
is have set 101s for 15 minutes with

724
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,440
each employee if you're on a team make

725
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,000
money or fridays a no meeting day

726
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
set up a meeting with your team to

727
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
explore ways on how you can improve

728
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
together you can always create anonymous

729
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,360
survey to find out what is going on and

730
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
how the company can do better but please

731
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,279
note not everyone's going to participate

732
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,919
and don't enforce it but also

733
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,679
have vulnerability disclosure policies

734
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,159
and someone who can manage the incoming

735
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,039
at the same time

736
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,559
and last

737
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,480
remember when we work together and

738
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
listen to each other magic does happen

739
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,399
and when we work together making sure

740
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,799
people get personal time off without the

741
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,279
fear and take time away we then become

742
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,840
collaborative but also acknowledging

743
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,080
that when we collaborate we also reduce

744
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,679
the stressful items that hold us back

745
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,480
from our team from thriving and focusing

746
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,000
on that balancing of work and personal

747
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,880
life is something very important for

748
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,399
everyone and we just support that

749
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,320
and also

750
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000
we need to work with the hacker

751
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,919
community bug bounty programs voluntary

752
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,919
disclosure policies are incredibly

753
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,200
important for reducing the stress on

754
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
your teammates because sometimes we need

755
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,320
a little bit of help outside our

756
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
security team

757
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,440
so overview right now does place you and

758
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,919
your team at a huge risk collaborate to

759
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,159
form strategies to improve the team

760
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,559
start making plans and revisit security

761
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,360
response plans and promote self-care by

762
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,480
being kind and respectful to boundaries

763
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,720
and also take some breaks that's the

764
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,919
only way you're going to heal from

765
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,360
burnout

766
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
i just want to say thank you all so much

767
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,159
for existing thank you for having me it

768
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,080
is a pleasure to be here if you have any

769
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,799
questions at all feel free to ask

770
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,399
but until then

771
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,240
i keep on hunting and i

772
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,120
yeah and please stay safe

773
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
bye
