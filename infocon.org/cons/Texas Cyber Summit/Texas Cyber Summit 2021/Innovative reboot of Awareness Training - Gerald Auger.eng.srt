1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,400
what's up everybody welcome to my talk

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,640
i'm very very excited to be here my name

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,040
is jerry osher and i am going to be

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
telling you all about a technique that i

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,759
have been using in my organization for

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,920
probably the last six months that has

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,800
had

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
wild success in educating the end user

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,960
community actually being engaging in in

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
enjoyable education uh surprisingly uh

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,279
and how i did it how you can do it right

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,079
so really if if we just take a step back

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,239
and think about it for a second you know

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,320
we as cyber security practitioners we

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,239
have lots of cool tech and lots of cool

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,840
tools but

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,399
we can only harden so much end users are

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
being socially engineered they're doing

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,399
what they need to do in order to get

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,320
their work done which sometimes involves

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,840
installing stuff that they shouldn't or

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,000
going to sites they shouldn't or doing

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
or just clicking through things because

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,120
they want to get done with what they got

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
to get done

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
how do we educate that group of people

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,399
in a way that's actually effective and

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,199
they want to learn right versus being

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,479
told to learn right when was the last

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,760
time you actually cared about something

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,280
that you were forced to sit through

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,600
versus something that you tuned into

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,280
because you were interested right so

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,479
just think about it from a mental

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
perspective so i'm going to be going

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
through what i did at the organization

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
why it worked and how you can implement

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
it too

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,560
so really quick who am i because you

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,320
might be like who is this clown i don't

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,400
know you right if you don't know me my

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
name is gerald lozier i've worked in the

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
cyber security space for about 17 years

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,079
i worked in healthcare i worked in

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
financial um

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,759
well i did work in financial but very

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,640
shortly i worked in federal i.t

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
and now i'm currently working in

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
manufacturing running my own information

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
security program i'm also the chief

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
content creator at simply cyber which is

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
a youtube channel designed to help

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,079
people make and take a cyber security

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
career further faster and i'm very very

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,320
engaged with the community on linkedin a

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
little less on twitter but infosec

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
twitter is pretty awesome

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,159
so as technologies advance and you know

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,079
attacks on the end user increase right

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
this is you know i put zero trust here

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,399
right like as we move to the cloud the

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
user account becomes more important the

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,319
identity uh becomes more important to

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,920
protect and it's just easier to

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,239
get end users who already have trusted

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
accounts to get them to give bad guys or

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
you know pen testers access to their

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
active account to use in you know

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
furthering their attack whether it's

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
lateral movement or it's uh you know for

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
privilege escalation enumeration

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
whatever

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
at the end of the day the focus has been

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,640
put on the end users right so

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
when we're when we're talking to our end

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
users right we really one thing that i

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
want to preface this by saying is that

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,800
you really got to think about who your

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,440
end user is right so

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
when i worked in the healthcare space

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
you know physicians and clinical staff

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,760
they're walking around talking about all

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,040
the stuff that i have no clue what

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,800
they're talking about right and i'm sure

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
when i'm walking around telling you

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,159
about even basic terms that you and i

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,480
think are normal like authentication

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,599
authorization um you know architecture

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
zero trust you know even crazy things

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
like um

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,879
you know six-digit pin or multi-factor

92
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,480
or you know

93
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
anything like that they're just foreign

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,440
terms to these people so you could have

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
uh someone who doesn't understand

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
technology you know maybe they're new

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
they're new to technology altogether or

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,319
maybe they're a little bit older and

99
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
they didn't come up with technology

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
right or they just don't care right so

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
when we're writing our

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
language that we're going to be

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,040
communicating in our awareness training

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
it's very important that you use common

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
terminology you don't kind of drift off

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,159
into um the the technical pieces of why

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,760
they need to do it or the technical

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,319
pieces of why the defensive mechanism

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,239
that you're pointing out uh is going to

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,560
work or the def or the technical aspect

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
of how the attack is actually

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
perpetrated yes we think it's cool right

113
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
like i definitely think

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
a cyber attack you know although i don't

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,159
want to happen to my organization i

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,239
think it's really really cool and i am

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,879
regularly um it sounds perverted but

118
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,760
like i'm regularly impressed by just the

119
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,560
sophistication and somewhat elegance of

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
novel attacks that threat actors are

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
coming up with

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,720
but

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
the end user community that needs to be

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,400
aware of that attack they don't need to

125
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,479
know all that right so we just have to

126
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,320
focus on what they need to know about

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
so the current approach right

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
everybody you know especially if you

129
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,320
work in an industry that has compliance

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,880
requirements it's always like the once a

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,960
year powerpoint or maybe when you start

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,919
the job for the first time you get a

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,479
deluge of awareness training right you

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
get end user cyber security awareness

135
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
training you get

136
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,479
protocols for time keeping how to take

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
time off what the expectations are for

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,240
like osha requirements if you're working

139
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
in manufacturing maybe hip a training

140
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
right

141
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
like blood-borne pathogens like how to

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
report an accident like all this

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
training just is like drinking from a

144
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,440
fire hose you all know it we've all done

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,759
it and it sucks and it's completely

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
ineffective because people end up just

147
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,800
clicking through

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
not retaining anything because all they

149
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
want to do is get to their job and get

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,600
working start contributing and this is

151
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
an impediment and like i'm saying you

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,039
like

153
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,520
i don't want our training to look like

154
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,919
an impediment we want the end user to

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
desire it right and i know that's kind

156
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,840
of a strong word but like trust me when

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,639
we get there right so it's usually uh

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,320
annual it's compliance driven so it

159
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
covers all sorts of things there's no

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
flow to it there's no targeted messaging

161
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,400
to it and

162
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,320
really at the end of the day like if bob

163
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
in finance or you know claire in

164
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,520
accounting

165
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
like if we're talking about

166
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
i don't know like

167
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
uh multi-factor authentication or usb

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
drives media protection make sure you do

169
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
proper labeling and stuff like that like

170
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
it's not gonna resonate with them okay

171
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,919
so we've got to solve for that problem

172
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,440
so let's crane kick this these

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
weaknesses that i'm pointing out in the

174
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
face okay

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,840
let's talk about what the solution is

176
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
okay before we get into that i want to

177
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
point out like you know spoiler alert it

178
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,919
involves creating very targeted very

179
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
specific very pointed

180
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
multimedia messaging

181
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
that addresses a personal need of the

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,000
individual

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,960
less of the organization but it will

184
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,479
have a duplicative uh

185
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,319
value because if they're protecting

186
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,319
their own stuff they'll end up kind of

187
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,560
having that same behavior in protecting

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
the organization now let's talk about

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,919
why this is going to work and then i'll

190
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,800
get into a better example and show you

191
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,759
details okay so when we send an email

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
think about it yourself right think

193
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
about it yourself when you get an email

194
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,880
from hr or finance or corporate or

195
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,479
whatever and it shows up and it's just

196
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,360
like this huge word wall

197
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,919
it's like you may read it you probably

198
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
don't you probably even look at like the

199
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,599
banner like if it's that standard kind

200
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,880
of corporate banner you're like i don't

201
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,039
need to read this this isn't work this

202
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,639
isn't actionable

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,520
no big deal right so when we're sending

204
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
uh information security awareness right

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
if we if we take a step beyond just

206
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
doing the once a year powerpoint and we

207
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,360
send out like mail messages right like

208
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
hey like fun fact right

209
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440
like people are probably not going to

210
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
read it okay

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,639
so but if people are seeing the in the

212
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
statistics show this if people are

213
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,880
seeing something to watch a video clip

214
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
right we're in the age of tick tock and

215
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
instagram and youtube right people love

216
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
multimedia visual

217
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,759
ingestion if they see that they will

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,599
stop and check it out now whether or not

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,440
they care about it yet that's a separate

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
issue but they are going to stop they

221
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
are going to look right

222
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,120
one minute of video according to

223
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
forrester is equal to 1.8 million words

224
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,280
if i send you an email with 1.8 million

225
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
words in it i guarantee you you won't

226
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
read it if i send you a 60 second video

227
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
high probability you'll watch it and i

228
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
would i even go as far in my program as

229
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,080
doing like 30 second videos or 20 second

230
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,319
videos because

231
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,400
who doesn't have 20 seconds to give to

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
watch something that would be like

233
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,120
somewhat possibly entertaining right so

234
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
we're gonna be able to communicate a ton

235
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
more information in a shorter window in

236
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,519
a better vehicle um to our end users and

237
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,440
who you know executives are targeted in

238
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
spear phishing they're targeted in

239
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,440
business email compromise 59 of them

240
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
according to forbes would rather watch

241
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,320
than read okay and i don't think it

242
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
really is a reserve for executives i'd

243
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,160
rather watch something when i have a

244
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
problem and i google it i typically

245
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
watch a youtube video to see if i can

246
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,399
solve it unless it's like code and i'm

247
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
trying to copy and paste it right but

248
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
think about yourself right how are you

249
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,920
ingesting

250
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,480
content how are you ingesting education

251
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
and training

252
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
you know you may maybe you're not

253
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
someone who enjoys the video medium but

254
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
a lot of people it is the way that we

255
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
get it right so why don't we take

256
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
advantage of that

257
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,560
so here's the solution okay

258
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
here's the solution let's do the

259
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,600
technical piece first okay so

260
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
there's two um

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
hold on there's two solutions right that

262
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,480
i like to use um loom

263
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
is the one that i use and i'll show you

264
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,360
in a minute right it's a loom.com and

265
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
i'm not i don't have any financial

266
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
affiliation they have a freemium model

267
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
which means you can sign up and uh the

268
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,839
most you can do is record up to five

269
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
minutes of a video right so you couldn't

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,320
do like long form videos like 25 minutes

271
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
but like again we're talking about

272
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
making 30 second videos 45 second videos

273
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
so

274
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
you can use this loom account for free

275
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
and achieve your goal right you can also

276
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
if you want to do it local on your

277
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
workstation instead because maybe you

278
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
don't want to use a cloud-based service

279
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,480
to record your things for your

280
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
organization then you could use

281
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
something like streamlabs which is what

282
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,519
i'm actually using to record this video

283
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,160
right now and it's fairly easy to set up

284
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
and configure and you're off and running

285
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
but basically at the end of the day

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
these two solutions allow you to do a

287
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,839
screen capture and um

288
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,320
record your your video and your voice

289
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
right so

290
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
those are the three things that you're

291
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
going to need now i will point out

292
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
really quickly if you don't want to host

293
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
these videos because you have to record

294
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
the video right then you have to put it

295
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,399
somewhere so it can be hosted so then

296
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,160
when you send a link you can't no one's

297
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
going to attach like a 8meg

298
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
attachment video to an email right this

299
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,680
is 2021. so you'd send a link to a video

300
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,959
feed so where's it going to be hosted

301
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
maybe youtube maybe vimeo but maybe like

302
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
for me i don't want this this content

303
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,519
hosted on a public share so if you are a

304
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,200
microsoft shop i don't have other

305
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
solutions at this time but if you are a

306
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
microsoft shop you use office 365 um

307
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
which a lot of people do microsoft

308
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
stream is basically like an internal uh

309
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,839
youtube uh for organizations and you can

310
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
host it there and you know people in

311
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
your organization will be able to get to

312
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
it okay

313
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,600
so cool so we know how to we know how to

314
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,680
record the video we know

315
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
you know like kind of what the the tools

316
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,959
are that we're going to be using we know

317
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,640
where we can host it

318
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,519
but

319
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,600
like how does it work jerry tell me how

320
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
it works okay

321
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
all right so the operational piece and

322
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
sorry that uh the way i've got the video

323
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
uh lined up it's cutting off but you can

324
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,959
read it good enough all right so what's

325
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,959
the solution how do we operationalize

326
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,360
this plan of yours chair okay

327
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
so a couple things that you need to be

328
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
aware of first and foremost and and i'm

329
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,079
telling you this is based on research

330
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
that i've done i've been doing this

331
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
since april and

332
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
i literally have people emailing me in

333
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
the organization people from payroll

334
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,880
people from sales like hey jerry love

335
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,040
this message thanks so much hey i look

336
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,720
forward to your emails like i'm getting

337
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
that kind of feedback which is insane

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
right like people in our office are

339
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,680
typically avoided

340
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
so this is good but these are the

341
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
techniques that you should employ okay

342
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,760
first of all

343
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,839
you need it to be short okay like i said

344
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
30 to 60 seconds i really wouldn't go

345
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
north of 60 seconds or else you're gonna

346
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
lose people's retention okay secure

347
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
personally breathes good habit what we

348
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,959
are trying to do here is we're trying to

349
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,839
promote a behavior we're trying to incur

350
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,279
a bit and endorse a behavior in the

351
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,360
people so they stop doing something or

352
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
they start doing something right well if

353
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
you have personal skin in the game if

354
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
i'm telling you

355
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,000
for example multi-factor authentication

356
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,160
if i'm telling you to put multi-factor

357
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
authentication on your bank account

358
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,360
because

359
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
threat actors will steal your bank

360
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,560
account

361
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,000
password log in and take your money well

362
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,800
then

363
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
that resonates with people when you're

364
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
talking about taking people's money out

365
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,760
of their bank account they will listen

366
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,279
and they will they'll be like what do i

367
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
need to do i'm telling you same with

368
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,600
password reuse right so hey yeah i know

369
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
you don't really care about like you

370
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,959
know your pinterest account for example

371
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,399
but if you're using that same password

372
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,639
for pinterest in your financials guess

373
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,240
what when pinterest gets popped they're

374
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
going to use the same password to log in

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
so you need to not use password reuse or

376
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,639
maybe use a password vault um the point

377
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,880
is i hope you're getting this whatever

378
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,200
it is patching your computer password

379
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
hygiene user accounts not sharing

380
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,560
passwords

381
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,040
whatever it is personalize it because

382
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
it's going to have the effect that

383
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
they're going to start doing it

384
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
understanding it wanting to work through

385
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
some of the challenges of like setting

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,920
up multi-factor right but then when you

387
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,880
push it into your organization or your

388
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,399
you've already got in your organization

389
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,839
people are grumbling about it or

390
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,800
whatever

391
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,199
once they see the personal value of it

392
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,079
they will want to um

393
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,120
they'll see the value for the

394
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,199
organization which is huge right again

395
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,519
comprehension and language you want to

396
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,440
speak to your audience you do not want

397
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
to speak to another cyber security

398
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,040
professional or an i.t person okay

399
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,240
consistency is key i would i do a weekly

400
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
email okay that's a little aggressive

401
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
but that's how i roll uh i would

402
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,959
recommend at least uh at least a monthly

403
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,000
email

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,959
maybe bi-weekly if you can swing it um

405
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,959
when holidays come around or you know

406
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,040
the olympics or covid you know kind of

407
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,440
it's a if it's a specific um

408
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
event black friday right you may want to

409
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,399
send out an extra message uh blasts like

410
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,920
hey you know scammers are running all

411
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,440
the time on black friday watch out for

412
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
these deals um get people used to like

413
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
looking at email to see if it's kind of

414
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,279
a fish or a scam

415
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,079
right

416
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
but if you do it regularly and maybe in

417
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,760
the subject line you have like you know

418
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,839
whatever like watch out for the scam or

419
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
bad guys want you to fall for this kind

420
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
of a click baity type thing and then i

421
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,079
personally do dash cybersecurity tip of

422
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,120
the week

423
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,880
you could do cyber security tip

424
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,639
cybersecurity tip of the month whatever

425
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,920
it is you want some type of

426
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,639
cadence where people begin to expect it

427
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,800
people look for it when it pops up in

428
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
their inbox they click on it they want

429
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
to read it right but if you're doing it

430
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,959
kind of like sporadically

431
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
it could be all over the place and

432
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
you're kind of getting back to that

433
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,440
hit or miss right so i feel consistency

434
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,399
is key

435
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
uh look and feel

436
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
personally i run kind of the same look

437
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,560
and feel um simply because i want the

438
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,120
person my end user community

439
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
whoops

440
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,639
sorry um

441
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,360
with my look and feel i want my end user

442
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
to have um

443
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
to get used to it right i want them to

444
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,880
have expectations and i want the

445
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,279
expectations to be met

446
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,160
when

447
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,279
they receive that email right so i run

448
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
it just like this like you're looking at

449
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,720
right now with the bubble of my face and

450
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
whatever the messaging is over here but

451
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,560
you don't need to turn your camera on

452
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,839
right it could just be your voice you

453
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
could pick someone in your organization

454
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
who becomes the voice of information

455
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
security right so if you're introverted

456
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
or whatever

457
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,639
i personally do it this way because i

458
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,680
want people to know me i want them to

459
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
associate me with cyber security because

460
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,720
what has ended up happening as i was

461
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
hoping is that now when someone has a

462
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
problem they reach out to me directly

463
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
right so hey jerry this seems weird what

464
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,279
do you think right oh like that's

465
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
totally cool or that's an issue right

466
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,560
like let's let's dig in and i know for

467
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
larger organizations that have sec ops

468
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,600
capabilities and tens of thousands of uh

469
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
end users my organization has about um

470
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,959
1100 end users right so i can do that

471
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,639
but you could even you could even

472
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
include like hey you know at the end of

473
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,920
everyone if you got a problem contact

474
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
this email address right

475
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,120
but you don't need the camera on or off

476
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
it's it's more about the messaging and

477
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
the personalization okay you want to

478
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,519
keep slides limited right you want maybe

479
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
one or two slides you do not you're not

480
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,319
giving a powerpoint presentation to this

481
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,959
people in a 20 to 30 second time i

482
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,959
typically have like one slide that's

483
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,359
like really capturing the point so like

484
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
maybe it's password and why you should

485
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,439
use passphrases and the slide just has

486
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
you know passwords here and passphrases

487
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
here and i'm simply pointing out that

488
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,319
you know a passphrase is way more

489
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,559
complicated and also way easier to

490
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
remember you just got to wrap your head

491
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
around starting to use passphrases right

492
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
that's just an example right you don't

493
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,280
want to be given a powerpoint

494
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,120
presentation to these people

495
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,000
uh

496
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
same style every time again you're

497
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,320
trying to breed expectations and meet

498
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,120
them consistently right so

499
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,000
um like i said keep it 20 30 seconds

500
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
boom into the point have the title

501
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
matched to like whatever the content is

502
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,600
also i send it out in an email blast i

503
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
didn't put this in the slides i sent it

504
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
on an email glass with a subject line

505
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,799
that's kind of clickbaity and then i use

506
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,200
one or two sentences

507
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,160
um

508
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,960
like

509
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
just to grab their attention and then

510
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,559
tell them to watch the uh video to to

511
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,760
get more information okay um a pro tip i

512
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,559
put a thumbnail which is basically

513
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,919
we're all familiar with thumbnails on

514
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,559
youtube but basically i take the a

515
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,480
screenshot of um the the the card that

516
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,160
i'm using as my um slide in my talk and

517
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,280
i put that in the email i shrink it down

518
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
and then i drop a

519
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,120
hyperlink on that image and then make it

520
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,640
look like a thumbnail that they would

521
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
click on on youtube or anything else

522
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,000
like that again i'm trying to take

523
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
advantage of the behavior that most

524
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,480
people have already adopted when they

525
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
see a video clip with a play button on

526
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,520
it they will inevitably want to click it

527
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
right so i want them to click my video

528
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,400
so they can watch and learn the lesson

529
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
okay

530
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,320
so

531
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,280
let me see here

532
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
yep oh yeah so you can kind of see here

533
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,160
um

534
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,240
let me do this really quick you can kind

535
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
of see

536
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,240
you know here here's a sample of an

537
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,720
email uh that i did you could see this

538
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
one's a little bit lengthier

539
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
uh because it was around a self-service

540
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
password reset portal multi-factor

541
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,679
rollout type thing but what you can see

542
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,760
is kind of the thumbnail behind here

543
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,039
where it's the picture with the little

544
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,240
play button

545
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
and this is what i'm what i'm trying to

546
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
do right i'm trying to lead my audience

547
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
visually i don't want it to be tough for

548
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,200
them to figure out how to get the

549
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
information i'm trying to deliver them

550
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
okay so some actionable ideas for you

551
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,280
okay

552
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
i've already kind of rolled through

553
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,240
these a little bit but you can make a

554
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
video on just think about how you would

555
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
you would want to tell someone

556
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,000
uh like a a friend family loved one

557
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,919
about how to protect themselves right

558
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,760
like

559
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
mobile phone pin locks not picking up

560
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
usb drives and sticking them in uh

561
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
computers uh

562
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,559
social engineering be cognizant of that

563
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,039
phishing password reuse password vaults

564
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,280
multi-factor right you guys all know

565
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,400
this right you're we're all

566
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
practitioners here there's all best

567
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,039
practices basic basic cyber hygiene that

568
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,600
we want our end users to

569
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
do and you know kind of behaviors we

570
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,919
want them to have those are the contents

571
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
and videos that you should be sending to

572
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,400
them right and basically it will

573
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,280
complement your uh you know your

574
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,480
information security program uh a heck

575
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,640
of a lot better than an annual uh

576
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720
powerpoint well okay

577
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
okay so what are some lessons learned

578
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,520
specifically um from the last five or

579
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
six months that i've done

580
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,400
first of all um it's going to be

581
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,840
difficult if you're going to have the

582
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,280
camera on

583
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
it's going to be a little uncomfortable

584
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
at first it seems very weird talking to

585
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
an inanimate object as if it's a person

586
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,039
okay trust me

587
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,760
um edge of tomorrow i love this movie

588
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,600
probably in a minority here of people

589
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
that love this movie

590
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
but essentially the premise of it is is

591
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,840
that uh tom cruises wakes up in the

592
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,760
morning he gets killed at the end of the

593
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
day and then he wakes up in the same

594
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,120
morning kind of groundhog day except

595
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,799
like an action movie for lack of a

596
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,440
better term anyways the whole reason i

597
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,520
include it here is because when you're

598
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
recording if you want to write a script

599
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,760
maybe you only have to do it once but

600
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,280
for me personally

601
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
i kind of do it by the seat of my pants

602
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,000
and i will make mistakes or i'll realize

603
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,720
i'm using a terminology or word that my

604
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,400
audience isn't going to be a good fit

605
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,600
for

606
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,760
and i will want to start over so

607
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,919
typically when i make like a 30 second

608
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,440
video about why you should enable

609
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,200
multi-factor authentication on your

610
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
personal accounts it takes me 15 minutes

611
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,120
to make okay and the final product looks

612
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,799
cool and it seems super smooth but it's

613
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,000
because i've literally been just

614
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,080
grinding through the script the whole

615
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,280
time

616
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
so just be aware that

617
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,799
you you probably won't nail it on your

618
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,039
first take or if you do you might have

619
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,559
some ums and uh and pauses and you know

620
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,240
talking to yourself and stuff like that

621
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
so uh be comfortable

622
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,159
we're just restarting it restarting it

623
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,480
the loom tool actually has a restart

624
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,360
button that makes it incredibly easy to

625
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,400
just

626
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
you know throw away your current

627
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
recording and start a fresh recording so

628
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
i use that all the time

629
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
okay your av gear doesn't matter okay

630
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
consistency does right so i've got you

631
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
know i've got a sick camera i've got a

632
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,360
sick microphone got lighting and all

633
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
that that's cool most people don't care

634
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
about that right like if you're gonna

635
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,280
watch like a 35 minute video this talk

636
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080
maybe you care about it but in reality

637
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
if you just have like a camera right and

638
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,480
like it could be a webcam on your

639
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
computer it could be um your your

640
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,760
microphone or like um you know air pods

641
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,640
or or like the iphone cord pods or

642
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,720
whatever like that'll work just fine

643
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
long as you can be heard clearly you

644
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
don't have a lot of distracting noise in

645
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,000
the background and you can be seen

646
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
clearly that's it really the bulk of the

647
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,080
image should be kind of like the one

648
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,799
slide power point you have and you know

649
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,159
if you can just be heard you're good to

650
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,400
go

651
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,080
as i said consistency matters that you

652
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
should be doing it regularly again so

653
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,919
you breed expectation into your end user

654
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,360
community

655
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
i do say ease into

656
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,159
enterprise wide communication

657
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,320
personally you know like i have

658
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,640
authority now to email my entire you

659
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,840
know every single person in my

660
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
enterprise and i know in larger

661
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
enterprises it's way harder to get this

662
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
authority

663
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
but

664
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
as if you start doing this i would

665
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
strongly encourage you reach try to

666
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,720
reach to the entire organization but

667
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,559
work through communications work through

668
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,039
leadership cc them on them have them

669
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,640
pre-view

670
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,240
what the messaging is going to look like

671
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
and how you want to send it out and what

672
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,520
the idea is going to be don't try to

673
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,200
like you know circumvent them or just

674
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
email blast everyone that's not going to

675
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
work get buy-in from those parties

676
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,320
communications maybe legal and

677
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,520
leadership

678
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,799
because they're going to like it trust

679
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,400
me once it starts rolling and they're

680
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
seeing it

681
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
they're going to like it especially if

682
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
you can demonstrate that it's actually

683
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,279
reducing risk so

684
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,600
my my lesson learned here is that i

685
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
started that way and then i actually

686
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
found the communications and leadership

687
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,679
um didn't want me to bother them anymore

688
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,840
they didn't want like they had i had

689
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,400
earned their trust in

690
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
developing the messaging sending out the

691
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,679
communications and stuff like that that

692
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,600
they said go for it we'll just we'll

693
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,679
just review it as end users when we get

694
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,520
them and i've been doing that for

695
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,679
whatever like i don't know

696
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
many many weeks now right at least four

697
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,760
or five months um again don't abuse the

698
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,080
power don't like basically don't

699
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,559
email blast everyone with just like a

700
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,760
cool tip

701
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,000
that isn't part of like your strategy of

702
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
how you want to roll it out in your

703
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,360
consistency and stuff like that

704
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
because you could get that authority

705
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,200
taken away i will say that i've also

706
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,080
done kind of like impromptu messaging so

707
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,320
you know i do every monday but apple

708
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,840
recently had like a zero day that i

709
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,159
actually felt like was a concern for my

710
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,880
end user community so i bundled up a

711
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,600
kind of uh out of band

712
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,520
messaging and sent that out using the

713
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
same vehicle and a lot of people you

714
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,919
know updated their and their devices and

715
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,200
stuff like that and actually thanked me

716
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,440
for giving them that that knowledge so

717
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,640
there is a

718
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
value to it

719
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,159
okay so i was going to do a demo we'll

720
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,400
give it a shot just real quick here is

721
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,840
like my linkedin page if you want to

722
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,440
connect with me i love connecting with

723
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,960
people on linkedin and talking and

724
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
sharing ideas and stuff like that

725
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
but let's try a demo this could screw up

726
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,080
everything uh pretty royally so

727
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,559
we'll see okay so here's passphrases i'm

728
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,799
going to use loom which is in my um

729
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,480
which is a chrome extension for me right

730
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,600
now right

731
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,760
see if you can see it

732
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,400
all right so

733
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,159
okay so like hold on can i do it this

734
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:56,960
way

735
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
all right right so

736
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
my camera's here um

737
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,640
this is like off screen right now so

738
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,440
maybe i can do this

739
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
all right let's let's get it a little

740
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
tighter jerry

741
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,880
okay so you basically get the idea right

742
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,039
it says start recording down here

743
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
okay so

744
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
we would hit record and be like

745
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
and please understand that like i s i

746
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,400
can tell that my camera lens is kind of

747
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,159
jacked up right now but that's fine

748
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,440
right hey everybody this is jerry from

749
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
information security i wanted to take 20

750
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,440
seconds of your time to tell you why you

751
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
should be using passphrases over

752
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,200
passwords passphrases are way more

753
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,720
complicated but they're still special

754
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
characters pat like spaces exclamation

755
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,720
points see how i just messed up right

756
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,360
there so i would literally um

757
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,080
do a restart uh where's my restart

758
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
button

759
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,600
there is a restart button usually on the

760
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
side here

761
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,240
i don't see it right now of course

762
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,400
because i'm doing a technical demo live

763
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,480
but i would restart and i would start

764
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
again

765
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,919
because i made that small mistake but

766
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,679
for me i want a perfect message right so

767
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,440
again

768
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,640
hey everybody it's jerry from

769
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,559
information security i want to take 25

770
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,080
seconds of your time to tell you why you

771
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,320
should use passphrases over passwords we

772
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,840
all know what passwords are we use them

773
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
all the time well passphrases are

774
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,240
basically phrases that can be used as

775
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,840
your password but because they're

776
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,679
phrases they have spaces they have

777
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,360
punctuation marks they naturally have

778
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,279
capital letters they are going to have

779
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
all of that complexity that we ask of

780
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,559
you to have in passwords so next time

781
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,000
you're resetting your passwords think of

782
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,159
a passphrase instead you would be easy

783
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,360
to remember and it will be more

784
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,600
complicated to break thank you so much

785
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,480
right so that right there is exactly how

786
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,559
you can um

787
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,320
see how um see how my camera is all

788
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,440
jacked up now so um that is an example

789
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,159
really of how you can

790
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,240
put together a message very very quickly

791
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
get it out to your community and help

792
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,760
promote those changes in behavior to be

793
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,080
more secure and reduce risk to the

794
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,840
organization okay so again

795
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,440
again my name is jerry osher i

796
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,120
really really appreciate the opportunity

to speak at texas cyber summit

798
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,399
