1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,040
good morning good afternoon good evening

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,279
and welcome to texas cyber summit my

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,240
name is ray bango i'll be your speaker

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
for this uh this presentation and we'll

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,759
be talking about building the next

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,920
generation of secure developers and this

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,360
is something that's near and dear to my

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
heart i've been a developer for quite

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
some time i actually started programming

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,560
in 1989

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,800
and i've seen a lot of things over the

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,560
course of my career and more recently i

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,119
shifted over into security because i it

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
piqued my interest and i really wanted

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,679
to

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,238
help people just build more secure

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,399
systems and i felt it was a natural fit

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,640
for me to shift into application

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
security and start learning about some

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
of the dynamics uh that go into that so

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
as we go along um

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,039
talk a little bit about some of the

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,360
things that i've learned hopefully

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,879
share some of the experiences but also

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,440
try to share ways that we can help new

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,079
developers coming into the environments

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,760
into the corporate environments learn

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,239
how to build more secure systems and

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,960
also help the existing developers

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,559
think about the way that their apps are

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,799
being built and think about security as

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,960
a priority uh when they're building

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
those things out

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
so you know when i think about

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,640
developers i think about them in three

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
main buckets now

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
mind you this doesn't encompass every

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
single type of developer i know that i

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,720
understand that

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
but it's just the way i conceptualize it

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
i like to conceptualize it in terms of

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,320
enterprise developers the breadth

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
developers and the open source

44
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,439
developers and let me touch on each one

45
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,960
of them so you have the enterprise

46
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,720
developers and they're building uh

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
systems for corporate environments a lot

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
of the systems that maybe many of you

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,759
use day in and day out they're a little

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200
bit more conservative in their stack

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
because there's business continuity

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
concerns and they have to be very

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,479
considerate of their users it can affect

54
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,680
everything from

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,159
uh your ability to

56
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,399
withdraw money from a bank to actually

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,479
buying your groceries and so there's

58
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,040
that sense of let's be careful let's do

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
things calmly their adoption cycle is a

60
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
little bit slower because they want to

61
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,719
be more methodical and they also have to

62
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,240
make an investment in the technology

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,159
stack so

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,000
they're trying to be very cautious then

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
you have the breadth developer and the

66
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,880
breath developer

67
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
if you've ever worked at a startup uh

68
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
that's kind of the breadth developer

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
mentality i think about these are folks

70
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
who are the i what is it what's that

71
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
saying that goes um

72
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
move fast and break things they're a

73
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,959
little bit more um

74
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,440
more open to embracing more nascent

75
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,959
technologies newer technologies that are

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,080
coming in

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,120
they are definitely open source uh fans

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
and they're willing to take those risks

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,239
in order to have a an advantage in their

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,040
uh in their marketplace and so both are

81
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,519
actually very equally important but just

82
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,040
different mindsets in the way that they

83
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
approach technology and the way they

84
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,239
approach technology adoption and then

85
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,519
you have the open source developers

86
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,080
which i i'm a big fan of because

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
these folks are doing things and to for

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,560
a labor of love sometimes they built a

89
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
project that they find very cool and

90
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,480
they just want to get it out uh and they

91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
want to share it with the world and

92
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
sometimes these projects turn into

93
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
major supported efforts so i think of

94
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,080
like the jquery project which i was a

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,560
member of and so that became a very

96
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
important library in the course of web

97
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
development and and there's so many

98
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
other examples of that everything from

99
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,760
linux the linux operating system to

100
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
uh

101
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
kubernetes to all these other tools like

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,239
python and

103
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,560
uh golang and things like that these are

104
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
all open source efforts now that are

105
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
really important to the overall

106
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,440
development ecosystem in the overall uh

107
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
information technology ecosystem and so

108
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,799
uh

109
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,720
near and dear to my heart and but these

110
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
are the way i kind of think about

111
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,159
developers again each one of them could

112
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,879
have their own little sub trees below it

113
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,200
which describes them independently but i

114
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,319
just like to think of them in these

115
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,239
buckets and the reason is because you

116
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,080
know there is that way i can kind of

117
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
conceptualize what are their needs and

118
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
this is something that's really

119
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,519
i think it's something really important

120
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,120
for you as security practitioners to

121
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,840
think about what are the needs of these

122
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
individual buckets of developers and how

123
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,959
can we get them to think about security

124
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
within the context of those needs

125
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,159
so

126
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
part of the problem is that what does

127
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
security folks think of develop that

128
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,760
developers do well and this is from

129
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
experience i'm i'm i know i'm

130
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,238
generalizing but this is the general

131
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
feeling i get sometimes when i speak to

132
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,959
security folks security folks think that

133
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,400
developers are rock stars they're kind

134
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,639
of like jonas the jonas brothers

135
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,800
i think this is nick jonas here

136
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,080
my daughters of course would know this

137
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
for sure because they're all jodous

138
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
brothers fans

139
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,600
but

140
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
uh they're you know they're they're rock

141
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,680
stars they're hanging by the beach you

142
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
know we're coders and stuff like that

143
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
and it's

144
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
being a developer i can tell you it's

145
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,479
far from the truth there's a lot of

146
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,800
pressure and demands under on them

147
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,880
uh they're not soaking in the tub being

148
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
served drinks but you know i know

149
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
there's that misconception

150
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
but then there's also a misconception by

151
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
the developers saying you know they have

152
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,080
their own perceptions about what

153
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,479
security folks do and they think

154
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
security folks are like voldemort coming

155
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
down and striking fear into everybody

156
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,400
saying you cannot do this you

157
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
you have to follow the security protocol

158
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
you cannot touch this and so

159
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
there's always these challenges in

160
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
between the two groups and you know you

161
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
you want to try to balance out the need

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
for

163
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
the developers to be able to have the

164
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
capabilities they they need to

165
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
build the stuff that they want uh while

166
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,919
also being doing it in a secure fashion

167
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,320
and so two very different groups that

168
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,360
are there to uh to complement each other

169
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
but ultimately

170
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
to

171
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
to stay safe i guess that's the best way

172
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
to describe it

173
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,039
so i see security practitioners as

174
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,639
protectors i mean that's what they are

175
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,759
now that i've been in the security

176
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
industry for about four years i i truly

177
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,160
believe that there's this just genuine

178
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
interest of security professionals to

179
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
protect the systems that's what they've

180
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,759
been empowered to do that's their job

181
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
and so they want that

182
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
they want to make sure that all these

183
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,639
security protocols that they're putting

184
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,440
into place are respected and adhered to

185
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
and they're doing it for a reason and

186
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,560
but there has to be some flexibility

187
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,759
there has to be a little bit of a give

188
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,120
and take and that's where it's a dual

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,680
responsibility and i see developers as

190
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
builders they're trying to build the

191
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,680
next great experience and

192
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
as security practitioners we have to

193
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
enable that we have to figure out how do

194
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,400
we give them the tools and the

195
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
capabilities to be successful when

196
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,960
they're

197
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,560
trying to build things that will allow

198
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,440
the business itself to be successful and

199
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,680
let me let you in on a little secret um

200
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
since there's so many security

201
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,720
practitioners probably listening on this

202
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,319
this talk

203
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,680
uh

204
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
software development is really hard

205
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,039
and

206
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,720
just like security's hard software

207
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
development is so hard if you look at

208
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,000
the

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,680
landscape and i'm not touching on

210
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,199
everything for sure

211
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
there's everything from uh 25 different

212
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
types of programming languages at least

213
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
to

214
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
and to different platforms like mobile

215
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
and uh you have i you know you have

216
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,479
infrastructure as code you have all

217
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,039
these frameworks that go out there

218
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,280
not to mention now that you know the

219
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
complexity of devops and how developers

220
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,680
are now

221
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
they're they're taking on this

222
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
responsibility of building the

223
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,039
infrastructure and managing it and so

224
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
there's a whole level of complexity

225
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
across so many different types of

226
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,680
platform plays integration you have

227
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
laughs of course you have bug tracking

228
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
all these things

229
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,400
they just add a tremendous layer of

230
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
complexity to the development life cycle

231
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,199
and developers i have to say they're i'm

232
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,160
sure they're feeling a little

233
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
overwhelmed by all the things that are

234
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
coming down the pike and all the things

235
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,479
that they do in fact i i'm pretty sure

236
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
this was a developer who was feeling

237
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,360
that at one one point and if you it's

238
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,639
interesting you look at the stickers and

239
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,080
i'm actually like wow i'd like to go

240
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,199
back to those times when it was only

241
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
html5 css3 php

242
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,440
maybe node those are the simple times

243
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
but you can see this poor developer

244
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
putting putting his hands hand on his

245
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
head thinking oh god how do i deploy

246
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,240
this in a safe way or maybe they're just

247
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,400
thinking how do i just deploy this in

248
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
general it's

249
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,599
it's an interesting challenge for these

250
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,160
developers to think about and it's it's

251
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,039
not

252
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
an easy task by any means to be a

253
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,520
developer now in modern times and most

254
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
developers think of security as it's an

255
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,160
i.t problem um it's not if you think

256
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
about it's like oh well this that they

257
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
have to write you know they have to put

258
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,919
in security controls like um

259
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
access to systems and things like that

260
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
they have to uh i don't know they have

261
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,919
to load a waff they have to have an

262
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
edr system those are the ways that

263
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,919
developers i think think about security

264
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,919
from an i.t perspective

265
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,958
and it's not so much the code

266
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,399
perspective but from the i.t perspective

267
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,080
so when they have somebody from i.t

268
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,360
coming in and saying you need to think

269
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
about security and you can have accesses

270
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
it's almost like the security adds more

271
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,279
work it's like it's killing their

272
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,839
workflow and developers work in a flow

273
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
they're trying to get things from the

274
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,240
development cycle to uh to staging to

275
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
production and in between there's a

276
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,279
whole lot of other things that go into

277
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,600
it and so it's

278
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,080
security to them adds friction friction

279
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,519
to the way that

280
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,720
their

281
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
their workflow happens and it's hard

282
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,880
it's hard and if you think about this

283
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,959
these are some scary numbers

284
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,440
in a recent esg survey of cyber security

285
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
professionals 35 percent of respondents

286
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
reported that less than half

287
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
of the development teams are

288
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
participating in formal security

289
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
training so

290
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
that means that there's a boatload of

291
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
development teams that just really have

292
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
no concept of what secure

293
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
modern security practices are and it's

294
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
not to say that may not be writing

295
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
secure code thankfully a lot of the

296
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
manage

297
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
manage codes um uh manage runtimes

298
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,279
nowadays help with certain things in

299
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,800
terms of security but it doesn't cover

300
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
everything

301
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
and then also you know you you think

302
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
about this only three percent of u.s

303
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,040
bachelor's degree graduates have cyber

304
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
security-related skills so not only are

305
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
the folks in corporate america not

306
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
getting the training that they need

307
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,959
to uh to actually learn security but

308
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
they're not being taught in the schools

309
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,880
and that's that's a scary proposition

310
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
and this last one is really scary as

311
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
well 76 percent of apps have at least

312
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,079
one security flaw

313
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,360
and uh

314
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
and that half of security findings are

315
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
still open

316
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
six months after discovery and so what

317
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
that tells me is that not only do we not

318
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
have

319
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
security skills being taught at schools

320
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
and we don't have security skills being

321
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
taught at uh in corporations we're also

322
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,279
having to prioritize what those security

323
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,920
issues are when it comes to pushing code

324
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
into production and so if the developers

325
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
don't have an understanding of what the

326
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,720
prioritization of a security issue is

327
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
makes it hard for them to figure out

328
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
when should i tackle it is it a

329
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
just a bug or is it a legitimate

330
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,279
critical security issue and as we look

331
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,480
at some of the things that have happened

332
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
in our industry like the dependency

333
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,800
confusion uh issue that affected things

334
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
like nougat and other package managers

335
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
or uh package manage package manager

336
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
supply chain attacks like what happened

337
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
in pi pi and npm where malicious

338
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
packages were inserted into

339
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
these repositories

340
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,959
this kind of

341
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
really shines a light on the fact that

342
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,200
we need to get better at exploring what

343
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,040
security issues actually look like and

344
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
especially modern development stacks

345
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,920
like em like node or python or other

346
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,760
languages like that that do allow

347
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
developers to ingest third-party

348
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
packages there has to be a way of doing

349
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
that in a secure fashion whether through

350
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
software composition analysis which also

351
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,079
ensures license compliance and license

352
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,839
compliance is a big deal separate from

353
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,279
this talk but that is something that's

354
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
really critical to business continuity i

355
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
think we need to we need to really talk

356
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,720
with developers a little bit more about

357
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
license compliance and where that fits

358
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
into the conversations

359
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
but then we look at the oauth top 10 and

360
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
the os top 10

361
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
continues to be the bane of existence

362
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,720
for security practitioners why because

363
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
some of the things that we would have

364
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,399
expected to have been resolved by now

365
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
through uh the best practices of groups

366
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
like the olafs

367
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,279
i'm tongue-tied the os organization

368
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
they continue to show up and so things

369
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
like cross-site scripting and sql

370
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
ejection attacks and xml external entity

371
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,639
attacks these things continue to become

372
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
be pervasive in the industry and it

373
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,279
shows again this lack of understanding

374
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,680
of where these things sit in

375
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,279
in the development life cycle we need to

376
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,600
get better that we need to

377
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
show developers

378
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
how these things can affect them and we

379
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
need to enable them and give them the

380
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,880
tools to better learn how to solve those

381
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,000
challenges

382
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,880
and so

383
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,279
um you know why is this happening well

384
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,120
you know in many cases

385
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,399
again

386
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
graduates coming out of computer science

387
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,680
courses engineering courses and they

388
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
really don't have an understanding of uh

389
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
what the threat landscape is and you

390
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
know that's it's not their priority

391
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
they're being taught computer science

392
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
they're being taught whether it's c plus

393
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
or java or algorithms or conceptual co

394
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
you know topics

395
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
that's just the way that

396
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
universities teach now and it's not a

397
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,519
failing of the student themselves i

398
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,040
personally believe that

399
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,320
universities

400
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
need to do a better job of teaching

401
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,959
students secure coding principles i

402
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,399
think that's critical

403
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,839
we need to spend

404
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,920
we need to get these universities to

405
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,200
consider security um a top priority and

406
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,040
when you take into consideration things

407
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
like the new executive order the cyber

408
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
security executive order by

409
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
the uh the white house

410
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
where things like static analysis and

411
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,000
fuzzing and um software composition

412
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
analysis all the and having a software

413
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,040
bill of materials are now requirements

414
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
in order to work with the federal

415
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,079
government i think it's important that

416
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,480
universities start considering this as

417
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
part of their curriculum to help these

418
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,240
graduates coming out be successful in

419
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
the workplace but it's also a lack of

420
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
employer investment so many times these

421
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
students come in and they take a job and

422
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
there's no formal training there's no

423
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
on-boarding nobody's saying these are

424
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
the patterns and practices you need to

425
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,600
understand about in order to make sure

426
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
that the code you're producing is secure

427
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
and here's training that's going to help

428
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,079
you do that in a in a better fashion

429
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,199
there's

430
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,880
unfortunately i almost feel like there's

431
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,519
a lack of incentive to make security a

432
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,120
priority versus the business value of

433
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,959
what they're building and

434
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,040
that's a hard one to solve that's

435
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360
that's more of a c-level conversation

436
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
executive management needs to really

437
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,399
think about that

438
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,920
and with the number of breaches that

439
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
have been happening and the

440
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,959
um

441
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,920
the effects that those breaches have to

442
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
uh brand recognition uh

443
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
customer satisfaction customer loyalty

444
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,079
and customer trust i think it's

445
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,920
important to start thinking about

446
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,800
where

447
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,040
security sits within the

448
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,959
life cycle of development

449
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,920
and

450
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,279
you know a lot of people think that the

451
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,519
cloud is you know the end-all be-all is

452
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,199
going to solve everything and it and i

453
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,480
think the cloud is solving a lot of

454
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,760
things especially when it comes to

455
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,480
scalability and ease of deployment it's

456
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
making things substantially easier than

457
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,639
having i don't know a thousand physical

458
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
servers sitting in a data center

459
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,360
so

460
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,440
that's great the cloud is awesome i

461
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
support the cloud wholeheartedly but the

462
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,079
thing is that we can't

463
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
we we can't conflate the cloud security

464
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,480
mechanisms with application security i

465
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,440
think the cloud is making infrastructure

466
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,519
more resilient if you deploy it the

467
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,720
right way if you have somebody who's

468
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
really knowledgeable in cloud cloud

469
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,360
deployment

470
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,040
and they they put it out there whether

471
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,000
you're using azure or aws or gcp or

472
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,760
whatever if you do it the right way

473
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,079
you're going to have a fairly resilient

474
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,720
infrastructure implementation i i i've

475
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
talked to enough people that

476
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
i feel really strongly about that

477
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,920
but

478
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
this doesn't solve the application side

479
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,519
and in fact what's happening is because

480
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
these cloud infrastructures are much

481
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
more resilient these threat actors are

482
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,959
now shifting to the application side and

483
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,199
trying to find ingress via

484
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,880
vulnerabilities in the application that

485
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
developers are building and they're fine

486
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,000
they're they're being successful and

487
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,519
they're being successful through supply

488
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,519
chain attacks or things like sql

489
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,959
injection where they can get a web shell

490
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,560
and drop it on there web shells are

491
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,399
pervasive microsoft did a

492
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,600
a really good

493
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
blog post um i would say it was last

494
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
year was it last year

495
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
anyways they did it just look it up and

496
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,079
they did a whole

497
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,880
investigation into web shelves which uh

498
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,800
which highlighted the fact that these

499
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,040
are one of the biggest critical issues

500
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,199
for application security then we need to

501
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,680
think about how to identify web shells

502
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
and how to block them too

503
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
so some of the challenges and

504
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,720
opportunities that we have is that you

505
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
know we have this lack of secure coding

506
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
education

507
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,040
and yep that's that's an issue but we

508
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,000
also have the opportunity to help um

509
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
help developers get the tools and

510
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,720
materials they need to solve to to learn

511
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,199
more i mean we are empowered to do that

512
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,199
there's no reason why we can't do that

513
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,120
and developers also have a lot of

514
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,880
liberals and and high expectations

515
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,000
there's a lot of pressure for them to

516
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
build build build so maybe that's an

517
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,639
executive

518
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,600
management type of conversation where

519
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
the

520
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,880
the sprint cycles which in many cases

521
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
are like two-week sprints and everybody

522
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,399
has to get it out have to has to be

523
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,559
re-evaluated and the vulnerabilities

524
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,480
that are being produced let's say by the

525
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,079
tool chains that are being incorporated

526
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,359
into the ci and cd pipelines

527
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,839
those things need to be uh either better

528
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,000
instrumented or there has to be more

529
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,919
time taken to really analyze what a

530
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,599
vulnerability is and how does what

531
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
prioritization that vulnerability needs

532
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,119
to be given

533
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,160
into the development workflow itself

534
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
it's okay to take a step back and say is

535
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,880
that is that vulnerability a price zero

536
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
or is it a price three can we push that

537
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,960
out into production now and then come

538
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,559
back because it's not going to have a

539
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,640
dramatic impact on things let's say like

540
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
pii or

541
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,960
a threat actor breaking into our systems

542
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
those are things that are valid

543
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
conversations and that's part of the

544
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,240
threat modeling also too i think taking

545
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,600
a step back and you've probably heard

546
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
about shift left and saying let's shift

547
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,200
left and start thinking about

548
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
where some of these threats fall into

549
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
the conversation that's valid take a

550
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
step back do a shift left and say how do

551
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
we prioritize some of these things what

552
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,679
are the what are the vulnerabilities

553
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,280
that really do break the build and how

554
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,880
do we solve for that

555
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,799
and then we have of course technical

556
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
debt and that is really hard to solve

557
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
because if you have old systems out

558
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
there old code you have to figure out do

559
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
you air gap that you know i've talked to

560
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
customers in the past that the air gap

561
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
old systems that are running on windows

562
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
xp but they need to have it running and

563
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
it's the only version that they the

564
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
software only runs on windows xp that's

565
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,960
it and so they air cap it so

566
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
technical debt is something that has to

567
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,120
be considered and so there

568
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
there are solutions for it like hiring

569
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,919
somebody who's going to manage that code

570
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,760
base going forward but part of the

571
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,280
problem is that most developers don't

572
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
want to work on old code once a code is

573
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,039
done they want to go on and move to the

574
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,440
new shiny so i think there has to be

575
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
some

576
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,960
understanding somebody has to come to

577
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,520
understandings of who is going to manage

578
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
that technical debt and how is it going

579
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,039
to be managed and how are you going to

580
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
isolate it if you can't manage it in the

581
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
right way

582
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,160
and then there's also the opportunity to

583
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,440
show that

584
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,080
putting in security tool chains or tools

585
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,039
into the development workflow doesn't

586
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,200
necessarily have to be additional work

587
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,039
especially if you write you have good

588
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,440
tools that demonstrate what the

589
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
vulnerability is about

590
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
how to remediate it

591
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,120
demonstrate the code in a way that

592
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
developers can digest and actually take

593
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,720
action upon it you see developers they

594
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
they they work on bugs all day long they

595
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,039
know how to manage bugs and maybe we

596
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,400
need to start thinking about security as

597
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
part of the normal qa cycle and show

598
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
developers that yes a lot of these bugs

599
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,520
can't

600
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,400
they are

601
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,559
security issues are actually bugs and if

602
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,360
they interpret that as bugs

603
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,039
they might actually perceive it a little

604
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
differently they might say oh okay but

605
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
here's the here's the catch you have to

606
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,280
give them actionable information you

607
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
cannot just say here's a tool i'm going

608
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,679
to insert it and you're going to use it

609
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,360
and you're going to solve all you know

610
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
all security issues in the world it

611
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
doesn't work that way the tools have to

612
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
be something that

613
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,320
makes it

614
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
that are effective to solving the

615
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
development problems and

616
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,960
in so many cases what's happening is

617
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
developers are being brought to the

618
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,159
table and they're saying hey we have all

619
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,360
these tools and the developers saying

620
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
well i like that tool

621
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
and then you have the i'm going to call

622
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
it the parent figure sitting in the back

623
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
and the parent figure is typically the

624
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
abstech engineer or the cso or a cio or

625
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,120
somebody who's writing this checkbook

626
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
saying yeah i'm glad you like that

627
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,559
flavor but you know what

628
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,919
instead of giving you you know that

629
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,280
flavor we're going to force you to

630
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
choose the other flavor because that's

631
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,320
the one we're going to choose so

632
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,960
developers don't have that say then

633
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
and in many cases if you bring them into

634
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
the conversation and you allow them to

635
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
evaluate the options they're going to

636
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
give you great feedback that's going to

637
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
tell you this is what's going to solve

638
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,280
our problems in the most frictionless

639
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
way possible because

640
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,400
ultimately

641
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
automation is the developer's best

642
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,600
friend they want to automate everything

643
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
as much as possible because they're

644
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
spending so much time writing code

645
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,559
so if you're writing code all day long

646
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,919
in many cases you just want to press

647
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,679
that button and have it go out into

648
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,200
staging and production and be tested and

649
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,640
make sure things are going

650
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
fine so that way if you do find an issue

651
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,159
you can just solve it and go back into

652
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,120
the code and go forward automation is a

653
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
developer's best friend and i want if

654
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
there's one phrase that i want to kind

655
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,360
of emphasize to security practitioners

656
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,039
is automation is a developer's best

657
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
friend think about that when you're

658
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,799
going through your selection process

659
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,039
whether you're trying to select a sas or

660
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,320
a das tool

661
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,000
think about that and try to bring in the

662
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,480
development team to help you make the

663
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
best decision for what they actually

664
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
need not for what you feel is the right

665
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
choice for them

666
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
you have to partner with them to make

667
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,760
the right decision because

668
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
you know when you're

669
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
you're trying to think about building

670
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
security into the pipeline you want the

671
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,840
developers to be there and have that say

672
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,360
because they are touching all these

673
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200
different tools they're they're in the

674
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,159
ide they're working in their ci pipeline

675
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,840
they're working in their cd pipeline

676
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
they understand how all these tools

677
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
factor into

678
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
uh the build process and how long it

679
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
takes for things to happen the longer

680
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,799
something takes

681
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,039
for code to go from development to

682
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,720
staging to production

683
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
the more pressure the developers are

684
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,200
under

685
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
from management because ultimately

686
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,200
especially modern times

687
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,799
most management wants to code out

688
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,880
quickly they want that's why they've

689
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
shifted into agile process that's why

690
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,000
you have devops that's why you have

691
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,679
devsecops

692
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,919
development there's so much pressure on

693
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,000
development teams to get code out

694
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,720
quickly and get new features out quickly

695
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
so anything that's going to add friction

696
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,280
to them

697
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,720
they're you know they're they're going

698
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,159
to reject it

699
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,600
give them the opportunity to have a

700
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,440
conversation with you to

701
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,159
to let you know what are the things

702
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,159
that would break the build and what are

703
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,440
the things that would cause friction

704
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
because ultimately you want to empower

705
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
developers to innovate in the most

706
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,280
secure and frictionless way possible

707
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,760
all right i can't stress that enough

708
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
now

709
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,039
one thing that i'm a big fan of is

710
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,200
learning by doing i think that as

711
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
security practitioners you have a great

712
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360
opportunity to show developers how to

713
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,039
actually do stuff how to how do you

714
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,720
actually um

715
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
i don't know uh what's an excellent

716
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
what's an uh cross-site scripting attack

717
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
what is uh sql injection

718
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,840
it by by showing them that and then

719
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,440
correlating that to the actual code that

720
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
they're using

721
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
it kind of reinforces why they need to

722
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,159
take steps to

723
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
write code in a specific way that's

724
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,039
going to

725
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,480
prevent these things from happening i

726
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,760
guess that's the best way of describing

727
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,320
it and so like uh oh wasp i have

728
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,240
mentioned oasp earlier such a great

729
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,600
example of this they have something like

730
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,480
juice shop which is a very modern and

731
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,960
purposely vulnerable application and

732
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
it's obviously you can get it from the

733
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,720
olafs.org site and i'll show you that in

734
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
a second but there's other vendors like

735
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
varico the company i work for i'm their

736
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,120
uh security relations lead and developer

737
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,880
relations lead uh you can get it from

738
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
varicode but you can also get it from

739
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
tryhackme another hacking type of

740
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,840
service

741
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
i it's it's really a

742
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,200
it's really important to get hands-on

743
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,679
i found that developers learn by doing

744
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,520
and when they do stuff they actually get

745
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,679
they it helps them grok a little bit

746
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,400
more

747
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
what's going on and so

748
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
in fact one of the things i've been

749
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,960
trying to do is i have a twitch stream

750
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,200
myself and if anybody wants to come and

751
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,640
check me out as i'm

752
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
doing my application security stuff and

753
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
hacking by all means but this is

754
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
actually a screenshot of a video i took

755
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,279
um when i was going through drew shop

756
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,000
and showing how vulnerabilities happen

757
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,880
and so the way i i like to do it is i

758
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,760
actually

759
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,400
send people to the juice shop website

760
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
let me go over here let me switch and

761
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,320
you can see that and i'm turning my face

762
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
because i'm looking i have multiple

763
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,720
screens so i have to look at this over

764
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,400
here but you can see that here's the

765
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
oauth foundation it's a great resource

766
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,159
you're if you really want to learn

767
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,240
deeply about application security i

768
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
can't recommend the os foundation enough

769
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
because they've taken so many steps to

770
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,919
provide you with all the information you

771
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,919
need about the common trends in

772
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,559
application security now to me one of

773
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,720
the things i like to do again is learn

774
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
by doing and i think it's being hands-on

775
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,960
is important so i always send folks to

776
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,840
jewshop and now jew shop

777
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
it's it's a purposely it's it's

778
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,600
perfectly vulnerable application

779
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
it incorporates node.js

780
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,720
angular

781
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,919
i believe it's mysql and express and so

782
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,919
it's a pretty pretty relevant stack

783
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,000
nowadays for uh application building and

784
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
then there's a variety of opportunities

785
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
for a threat actor to go through and and

786
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,039
compromise the system and so

787
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,279
it's there's multiple ways of installing

788
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,039
it so you can

789
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
you can go ahead and actually even

790
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,559
deploy it if i go here to github i

791
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,960
believe i can even deploy it

792
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,240
from heroku which is kind of cool now

793
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
normally the way i do it is i

794
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,679
create a vm and i'll like an ubuntu vm

795
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
i'll install g shop on there and then of

796
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,720
course i'll attack it that way and the

797
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
reason is because i prefer to have

798
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,000
things kind of um

799
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
uh protected when you're taking a

800
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
purposely vulnerable application you

801
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,279
have to have take a lot of care

802
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,400
especially in a corporate environment

803
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
you don't want to put something out

804
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,120
there so that's why i'm kind of putting

805
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,559
the disclaimer out there about certain

806
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
things just be careful when you load

807
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,760
these things up and where you install

808
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
them you don't want to expose this

809
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,279
accidentally to the public and then it

810
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
compromises your system

811
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,640
but yeah for example you can click on

812
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,720
here and go to heroku and then when you

813
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,960
click here it'll actually

814
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,679
install a heroku instance that allows

815
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,760
you to tinker with juice shop directly

816
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,039
so you don't even have to do this in a

817
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,039
vm if you don't want to you can just

818
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
sign up for heroku and i i think heroku

819
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,039
gives you some free credits and you can

820
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,000
play with juice shop directly there

821
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
um all the code is available to you so

822
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
here's the great part about it not only

823
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,559
can you go ahead and install jui shop

824
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,799
and actually hack at it but you can

825
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,360
correlate certain things to code base

826
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,120
which is important to reinforce stuff

827
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
with developers remember we're trying to

828
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,559
teach developers why security is

829
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,559
important and where these security

830
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,640
issues fit within their code bases and

831
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,960
so if i go to g shop for example and i

832
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,640
have g shop here running

833
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
again i'm running it on an ubuntu

834
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
instance here's shop running it's just a

835
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,559
simple mpm application

836
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,320
another application so i just do npm

837
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,279
start which starts up on the instance

838
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,520
and then from here i can just access it

839
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
really simply but through my browser

840
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,480
and it looks like any normal type of

841
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,760
application

842
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
but the cool thing is that you can run

843
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
through this and demonstrate oh well

844
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
here's an email address i can use that

845
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
in some fashion explain what a threat

846
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,679
actor might do and i'll give you an

847
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,200
example mind you i've done this before

848
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,880
so i'm kind of cheating but i know that

849
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
if i go here and i say all right if i go

850
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,399
i don't know

851
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,919
boom

852
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,120
or

853
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,520
one equals one

854
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,320
and i'll copy the same thing in here

855
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,760
i wonder what could happen here if i do

856
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,320
this all right i do that and guess what

857
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,000
i got immediate

858
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,039
confirmation that i've compromised a an

859
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,360
actual account and so this is this is

860
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,440
the type of stuff that helps reinforce

861
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,760
some of the things that developers might

862
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
experience in a real world and how a

863
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,360
threat actor might actually tinker with

864
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,440
their application so if i go here sure

865
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,559
enough i am admin at jew shop

866
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,600
you know

867
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
but it's also cool to show them that

868
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,279
look if you go here and just use regular

869
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,600
common developer tools well

870
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,520
here's their javascript file and what

871
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,559
have i said all right i'm going to

872
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,039
search for scoreboard and scoreboard is

873
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,880
something that i know is in here but

874
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,720
part of the reason is because the code

875
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
here is it's packed and so many

876
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,919
developers believe paccode is obfuscated

877
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,840
code and nobody can compromise it and we

878
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,039
need to make sure that they understand

879
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,120
that no you can you know you can

880
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,039
prettify it firefox has something that

881
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,960
can let you prettify the code and there

882
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,399
it is and then you can even search

883
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,080
through it and thread actors will search

884
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
through the say score

885
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,720
board

886
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,840
all right and here and i can go to there

887
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,000
and search and say oh okay there's a

888
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,919
path called scoreboard so let me copy

889
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,159
this

890
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,559
and i'll go this and see

891
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,080
what happens now

892
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
alright great so now i found the

893
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,320
scoreboard and so these are uh it's

894
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,159
important to demonstrate these things

895
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,559
and show that things like obvious like

896
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,320
packing and obfuscation

897
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,399
doesn't actually um

898
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,000
shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a

899
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,159
security boundary that a determined

900
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,080
threat actor could get to some of these

901
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,440
things and

902
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
wreak some havoc

903
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,159
but then you also want to kind of

904
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,440
correlate some of these things to the

905
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,799
code base so you want to be able to go

906
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,640
to let's say the login page and say all

907
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,600
right here's the code inside of juice

908
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
shop for the login page and this is

909
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,559
where you're accepting um uh unsanitized

910
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,000
input from the user and this is where

911
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
you're not

912
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,679
ensuring that your sql is parameterized

913
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,840
in a way that's not going to cause a sql

914
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,159
injection attack the same for a search

915
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,279
and so maybe you're going to do

916
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,200
something in here where you're going to

917
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
accept a search criteria but you're

918
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,880
accepting input that could turn into a

919
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,559
cross-site scripting attack

920
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,240
the bottom line is that you want to give

921
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
developers

922
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,440
not only the experience of seeing what a

923
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
threat actor would do with their

924
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,279
application but you want to reinforce it

925
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,440
by showing them where in the code some

926
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,360
of the things can happen correlate the

927
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
two because then it kind of reinforces

928
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,679
that these are the areas that are really

929
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,960
important for you to consider when

930
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,720
you're building out your systems and you

931
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,240
want to build it out in a secure fashion

932
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,640
um as we go along you know again this is

933
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,799
try try hack me try hack me gives you

934
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,559
the opportunity to do juice shop just

935
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,039
like i did here but they do it in a

936
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,039
in a hosted environment so you

937
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,640
you're it's virtualized it's not on your

938
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
system it's protected and the same thing

939
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,720
with verico the company i work for we

940
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
have security labs enterprise which not

941
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,200
only offers that same type of juice shop

942
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
experience but also offers a bunch of

943
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,960
other exercises that help developers

944
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,320
understand secure coding practices

945
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,440
you know but

946
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,039
the way i look at it security is a dual

947
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,640
responsibility

948
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,320
you can show developer stuff but it's

949
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,000
also a responsibility for security

950
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,200
practitioners

951
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
to learn what it means to be a developer

952
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,200
and i'm not saying that you have to

953
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
learn how to code you know application

954
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,640
but i think it's important for you to

955
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,399
spend time and understand what

956
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,960
developers need during their day-to-day

957
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,240
and then how does security fit into that

958
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,559
so many times i hear security folks

959
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,679
thinking the other way around the

960
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,760
developers need to think about security

961
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
but maybe security practitioners also

962
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,519
need to think about development and how

963
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,840
security fits into that

964
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,760
and if you haven't taken that time

965
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
maybe you need to rethink that a little

966
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,720
bit and say let me spend some time with

967
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
the development team and think about

968
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,679
what are the challenges that they're

969
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,840
facing from a development lens

970
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,760
you know spend time with them and teach

971
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,559
them about the cyber attack kill chain

972
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,840
walk them through what a threat actor

973
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,679
would do whether it's reconnaissance or

974
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,039
weaponization

975
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,960
um think about what an exploitation

976
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,360
looks like explain what a c2 is

977
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,679
in many cases it's important for them to

978
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,519
have this understanding it's not a mean

979
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,679
we're not saying they're going to become

980
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,840
security professionals but if you give

981
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,440
them an understanding in a lay of the

982
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,799
land of some of the things that you're

983
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,919
seeing

984
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,000
then i think they might start

985
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
considering

986
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
some of the challenges that you're

987
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
facing and how that applies to their

988
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,200
code base and also demystify what

989
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,440
threat actor is i mean so many people

990
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,720
and this is the media of course the

991
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
threat you know they want to put this

992
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,039
some person in a hoodie sitting in a

993
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,039
secret room doing all this stuff and

994
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,360
sure there might be some folks like that

995
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
but the majority of them are just

996
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,039
average people who have really good

997
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,399
skills

998
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,279
and

999
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,720
um they might wear a hoodie because

1000
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,760
they're cold but they don't wear a

1001
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,200
hoodie because they're a hacker you know

1002
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,279
i i think we need to demystify this a

1003
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,640
little bit we need to

1004
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,799
get folks to understand that yeah this

1005
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,880
this person is not a real representation

1006
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,799
of what a hacker is this is just the

1007
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,480
media's representation of what a hacker

1008
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,120
is and you know one thing i've realized

1009
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
is that when you start talking to folks

1010
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,960
about security eventually they're going

1011
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,120
to self-select you're going to find

1012
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,080
folks who are going to be really

1013
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,679
interested in this i'm i'm i'm an

1014
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,880
example of that

1015
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,480
security piqued my interest i was a

1016
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,159
developer for a long time but security

1017
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,840
got me and when i went to my first

1018
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,919
defcon i was hooked that was it i wanted

1019
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,080
to be in security so

1020
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
these folks will self-select and you

1021
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,679
know you're

1022
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,320
you have the chance to kind of cultivate

1023
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,399
that relationship with them build that

1024
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,720
trust help them better understand what's

1025
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
important from the security lens and

1026
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,159
then once you do that if the other part

1027
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,159
that's important is to follow through

1028
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,840
you need to give them the tools

1029
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,039
necessary

1030
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,880
for them to understand how does security

1031
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,760
fit into development uh how do you write

1032
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,039
secure code

1033
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,559
what is active what is application

1034
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,960
security what does that mean all right

1035
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,399
and you know like this book the web

1036
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,159
application hackers handbook that was

1037
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,200
one of the first books that was

1038
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,039
recommended to me when i got into

1039
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,880
security it's almost like

1040
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,440
it's like the bible of web application

1041
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,760
security hacking and so

1042
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,919
these are things that in my opinion are

1043
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,440
low cost low friction type of tools

1044
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,880
most people like to read

1045
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,039
i love to read give them the books give

1046
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,039
them books give them tools things that

1047
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,039
will help them learn to be more

1048
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
successful security practitioners within

1049
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
the context of their code base help them

1050
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,040
be successful in the things that make

1051
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,520
them excited and enable them with the

1052
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,800
right tools

1053
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,199
but then again you need to understand

1054
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,199
what their to what their tools look like

1055
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,040
you understand need to understand what

1056
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,520
is their process for getting stuff out

1057
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,639
because that's the only way that you're

1058
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,918
going to be able to effectively secure

1059
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,359
things and it's the only way that you're

1060
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,879
going to be able to effectively partner

1061
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,199
with them you need to speak to their

1062
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,199
language developers have their own

1063
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,918
unique language their own unique cadence

1064
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,480
their own unique tool needs and you need

1065
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
to understand that you need to spend

1066
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,079
time with them and you need to um just

1067
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,079
show a little empathy because their work

1068
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,159
is really challenging as well and i'm i

1069
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,839
i've lived that so i'm i'm trying to get

1070
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,599
better at this i'm trying to better

1071
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,599
balance my understanding of

1072
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,359
developer workflows as well as where

1073
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
security fits into that and how i can

1074
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,839
help developers become more successful

1075
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,920
if we do this i think we'd have a really

1076
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,160
good opportunity to build more folks

1077
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
that want to get into security and we

1078
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
need that we we have a we have a need

1079
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,280
for like 2 million cyber defenders and

1080
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
we need more folks who are willing to

1081
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,800
jump in and become those security

1082
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
champions folks who

1083
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,320
want to make sure that we don't suffer

1084
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
the next solar winds or cassette attack

1085
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,560
or that we don't have the next mpm you

1086
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,040
know issue coming down the pipe

1087
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,320
it's important

1088
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,480
and if we spend the time to learn what

1089
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,599
developers need and give them the tools

1090
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,839
that make them successful and also

1091
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,920
advocate for better security training

1092
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,320
not only in the university settings but

1093
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
also in corporate america i think we're

1094
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,440
going to get there and we'll build some

1095
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,760
better and more resilient applications

1096
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,119
so thank you so much for your time i

1097
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,720
really appreciate it again my name is

1098

ray bango i

1099
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,000
use i'm a security and developer

1100
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,960
advocate for barocode and i'm so happy

1101
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
to have been able to deliver this

1102
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
presentation

1103
