1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
hi everyone

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,840
welcome to this session where i'll talk

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,640
uh

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,160
as mentioned about friendship and how

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,400
basically you can automate that

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,639
and i'm saying stay ahead of the game

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,960
just as sort of a fun title

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,760
but obviously it has a meaning

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
you somehow need to stay ahead of the

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,800
hackers it's obviously not a game

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
but they're getting smarter and smarter

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,119
every day and they have basically

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,599
they can do a million attempts to hack

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,320
you but they only need one to succeed

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,960
you need to stop all of them

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,239
or you'll have a

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
compromise so i'm going to teach you in

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160
this session um a little bit more how to

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
proactively hunt for friends

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,800
uh so as mentioned my name is

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
christopher von armada i'm based out of

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
the netherlands and i'm a developer

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,960
advocate security if you have any

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
questions please drop them in

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,800
i'll also pause here and there during

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,039
the session to

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,559
to make sure that all of them are

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,120
answered

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,040
so

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
before i start

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
i would like to make a a statement and

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,920
that is that there's simply too much

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,760
information out there

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,479
and um that is obviously quite a broad

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,200
statement but i'm meaning specifically

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,960
it's um

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,159
threat intelligence um so information

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,439
about new threats that might be going on

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,240
new

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,479
malware campaigns

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,040
and specifically as audience i mean

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,000
security operation center analysts so

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
there's literally too much information

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
to consciously process

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
so therefore we need to and automate as

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,399
much of this

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,799
analysis and enrichment

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,920
so that

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
your analysts

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,240
human beings only have to look at the

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,479
things that actually matter uh so

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,799
hopefully at the end of this session uh

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
this statement will make uh more sense

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,399
uh and probably you'll you'll always

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
already agree with me um

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,479
all right so the agenda for today um

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,639
yeah first of all i i'll do a quick

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,280
introduction into fret hunting i'll then

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,520
do a um introduction into securex and

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
threat response which will be uh yeah

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,120
basically main topics that i'll talk uh

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
talk about today

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,599
um

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,800
i'll then talk about two use cases um

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
one using twitter the other one using

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,360
talos blogs but also more as source

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,200
of fred

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
fret intel and it will make a little bit

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
more sense as we as we go along and

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
obviously we'll finish off with a

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
conclusion

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
uh and i'll save some time if there are

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,760
any questions for at the end there

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
so the introduction to threat hunting

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,920
probably if you ask five different

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
people what fret hunting is

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
they'll all say something different

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,440
but

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,040
i think

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,360
everyone will agree that threat hunting

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
usually involves

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
proactively hunting for something so

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
that means you're not reacting but

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
you're proactively going out and looking

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,720
for threats instead of waiting until an

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040
alert pops up

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
so there is actually a very smart person

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
that

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
that

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
wrote

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,280
basically an article about fret hunting

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,879
i would definitely recommend checking it

93
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,959
out and i'm just using this as an

94
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
example because he had a pretty good

95
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
threat hunting loop

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
which i thought was quite interesting

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,879
and this is basically a continuous

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,040
process which you will

99
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
yeah should

100
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
at least be doing at all times if you

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
have a good security operation center

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,760
and i have to say i've i'm a developer

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
advocate right now

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
before i was five years in

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
the field as a consulting systems

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
engineer

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
and i did not get in contact with a lot

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
of customers that really had a a very

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
good security operation center because

110
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
people are scarce they are expensive

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
because they are scarce

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,478
and some people do have the money but

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,478
just can't find them

114
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,080
so basically what you should be doing is

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
you should create hypotheses for example

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,639
a hypothesis could be

117
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
um

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,759
i

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,560
i have the feeling we are attacked by a

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,080
certain type of new malware

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,280
campaign

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919
well next up you go and investigate this

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
malware campaign so you're going to see

124
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
what tools and techniques that they use

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
what kind of patterns can you uncover

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,080
um

127
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
finally you'll start enriching and

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
do analytics so basically your

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
investigation so far you're going to

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
test against your own data in global

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,479
data to see if you can find any

132
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,759
correlations

133
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,240
and with that information you can then

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
either confirm or deny your hypotheses

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,198
now especially that part

136
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,520
this part the analytics part and the

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
enrichment part specifically you can do

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,199
a lot of

139
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
automated methods here

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
and during this session today i'm going

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,919
to tell you a couple of them but

142
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,240
obviously there are way more that we can

143
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,919
cover

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,560
so this is also quite interesting

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
in that same article

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
about fret hunting

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,919
the writer or the offer talks about

148
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,479
different levels that you might have in

149
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,240
maturity

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
of fret hunting

151
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,800
and basically if you look at level zero

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,759
room relies per prior primarily on

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,280
automated alerting

154
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
little or no data collection so

155
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
basically this means you install

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,400
firewall and you just wait until another

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
pops up level 4

158
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,319
if you see that

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,440
level 4

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,080
actually says that a majority of the

161
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,840
successful data analysis procedures are

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,000
automated and i really like that word of

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,280
automation

164
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,080
of the data analysis

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,759
and

166
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,720
actually

167
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
doing a

168
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,120
data analysis in an automated way with

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,759
tools like securex is actually not that

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,639
hard

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,440
so getting from level zero to four

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,360
obviously takes quite

173
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,560
some

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
some governance and rights procedures

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,240
and the right people

176
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,560
but you can actually take some stuff

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
from uh level four quite easily

178
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,800
um now just uh finally uh last couple of

179
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
slides on fret hunting year um i

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,759
mentioned this in the beginning already

181
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,880
i i see like two types of fret hunting

182
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,199
you have on demand hunting

183
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
which is basically more reactive so

184
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
something has happened something was

185
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,840
triggered and you go and do more

186
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,319
research the other one is more automated

187
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
continuous hunting and that's uh what

188
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
i'll while i'll show you two demos of

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
today

190
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,280
and that that more resides around taking

191
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,479
in data

192
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,080
and automatically

193
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,639
cross-correlating this or

194
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,639
cross-referencing this

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,880
against your own data and see if you

196
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,440
actually have you might have compromises

197
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,479
in your organization

198
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,199
um now this is also uh interesting um

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
this is the pyramid of pain if you

200
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
google the pyramid of pain well maybe

201
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
add cyber security i'm not sure what

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
else you'll find if you google the

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,840
pyramid of pain but you'll you'll find

204
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,400
this pyramid and basically they talk

205
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
about

206
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,240
hey

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,960
this is how you can hurt a hacker

208
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
so if you look at the bottom you see

209
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
hash values and ip addresses

210
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,400
for a hacker it is like the most trivial

211
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,319
thing ever if

212
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,240
their malware file

213
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
is found by

214
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
security systems

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
and that file hash

216
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,400
is basically added to a block list

217
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
somewhere for example talos also does

218
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,080
this with our amp infrastructure

219
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
it literally takes maybe one click of a

220
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
button in their comments in their code

221
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,240
of their malware and the file hash will

222
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,799
be different so people if you understand

223
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
how hashing algorithms work if you make

224
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,560
minor changes the file hash will change

225
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,519
so

226
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,519
if you find their file hash they're like

227
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,399
okay fine i'll just generate a new one

228
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,880
that's what we call polymorphic uh

229
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
malware basically malware that can keep

230
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
changing so that it's difficult to

231
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,800
detect

232
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,600
um

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
now ip addresses similar and domain

234
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,640
names if you find these form a hacker

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,440
they can generate new domain names uh

236
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
host their stuff on a different ip

237
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,160
address

238
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,040
so

239
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,959
still

240
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,680
yeah quite simple and easy if you really

241
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
find out their network and host

242
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,680
artifacts this starts to get annoying

243
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,320
finding out their tools their techniques

244
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
etc um

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,440
and procedures um the last one if you

246
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
find out what they're actually doing how

247
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,800
they operate

248
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,519
yeah that's that's killing for hackers

249
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,880
um

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
if you ask me

251
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,200
um

252
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,399
these

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,080
below um

254
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,279
these first four layers you can probably

255
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
automate a lot of this stuff around here

256
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
finding these blocking them etc

257
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,279
up up in the chain this probably

258
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,080
requires human interaction so here you

259
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,680
probably need

260
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
to get your analysts and let them

261
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,240
analyze what is going on

262
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
so we'll be talking mainly about the

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
first four layers first

264
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,200
and what we want to do is create

265
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,480
bite-sized chunks for your analysts so

266
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
that they can do the top two layers

267
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
so

268
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,600
yeah let's let's find out what what we

269
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
can do

270
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,480
now in this session we will use two um

271
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
tools basically well probably more but

272
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,839
two main tools

273
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,519
one is python

274
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,519
my favorite programming language right

275
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,120
now

276
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,839
which i switched to uh yeah a couple of

277
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,040
years ago

278
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
well actually probably seven or eight

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
years ago i switched to python from

280
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
other languages and yeah i prefer it uh

281
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
a lot and within cisco we use it a lot

282
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,839
so it makes sense to talk about it today

283
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
the other one is qrx securex was

284
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
launched well specifically threat

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,519
response was launched a couple of years

286
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,399
ago

287
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,600
securex is basically now the platform

288
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,480
uh within our cisco security portfolio

289
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
and threat response is one of the

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
applications or features of securex

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
but mind you threat response was there

292
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,519
actually earlier

293
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,399
now

294
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,320
now that we talked about threat hunting

295
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
um i want to dive a little bit more into

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,079
a secure x and threat response

297
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,839
just quick summary

298
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
threat hunting in my opinion uh what

299
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
we'll be talking about today is more the

300
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
continuous automated threat hunting

301
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,519
and

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,600
that means that you're proactively

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,399
looking

304
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,200
for threats in your environment

305
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,640
and

306
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
yeah the enrichment of data and the

307
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,760
cross-referencing of data we can very

308
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
well

309
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
automate

310
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,560
and obviously we're going to use carex

311
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
and fret response for it

312
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,440
so if you look at secure x

313
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,680
i prefer not to use marketing slides so

314
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,880
i usually dive into this

315
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
slide

316
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,399
secure x is an architecture it's not

317
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
it's not really a product we actually

318
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
offer it

319
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
for free to customers

320
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
so if you buy one cisco security product

321
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
you get securex included

322
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
and it's basically an architecture

323
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,399
platform that contains multiple features

324
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,440
um

325
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
first of all you need to log in

326
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
into the dashboard uh you we do that

327
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
with duo

328
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,079
you then have features like threat

329
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,800
response as a security threat response

330
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
securex orchestration

331
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,760
these are two big applications within

332
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,639
the securex architecture

333
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
for those that know

334
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,959
the orchestrator is actually based on

335
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
action orchestrator

336
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,480
which has now been sort of

337
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
internally acquired by the security

338
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,839
business group

339
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,680
and it's now fully integrated into

340
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,959
securex

341
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,519
and this is basically a load to no code

342
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,040
orchestrator

343
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,399
threat response we'll talk about a

344
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,959
little bit in more detail later

345
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,000
but basically it allows you to

346
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
investigate threats and respond to

347
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
threats as well so this is also that

348
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
response you can also trigger

349
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
orchestration workflows from threat

350
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
response

351
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,639
now on the right here we see our cisco

352
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,440
products and we see important arrows

353
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,760
going back and forth on the one hand we

354
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
see local threat intelligence for

355
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,720
example this can be firewall logs

356
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
uh that we query

357
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,360
from securex it can also be global

358
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
threat intelligence that we query for

359
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,560
example from talos or amp advanced

360
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
malware protection

361
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,880
but we can also back and forth send

362
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
response actions and triggers

363
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
so um

364
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,199
basically we can

365
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,519
do read operations but also write

366
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,120
operations if you uh if you make it very

367
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
simple on the same hand we can do that

368
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,519
on the left as well with third party

369
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,040
products as well

370
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
so we don't just do it with cisco we do

371
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,199
with third party as well

372
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
and

373
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,760
yeah we have a ribbon framework which is

374
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,319
sort of a

375
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
a pop-up window that you have in securex

376
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,320
and now in the whole of cisco's

377
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,360
secure

378
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
portfolio and it's basically you can

379
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,320
cross-launch into other applications

380
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,199
with the ribbon you can also

381
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,839
frost launch into threat response etc so

382
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,600
it's quite a cool framework and i'll

383
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
show you it in the demo later

384
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
what securex basically does and

385
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,199
specifically also threat response is api

386
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,720
aggregation

387
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,040
so securex pulls data and pushes data

388
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,800
through apis

389
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
if i were to do anything in securex and

390
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
i click the

391
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,639
close tab button

392
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
then uh the tab will be closed and the

393
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,360
data will be gone or maybe it will be

394
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,160
temporarily stored somewhere in in cache

395
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,199
well actually i don't think we do that

396
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,160
so we are not a sim so secure

397
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,639
uh intelligence a security intelligence

398
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
and event management system we don't

399
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,360
gather data um

400
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
we pull data when we need it and we push

401
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,000
data when we need it and that is

402
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,639
actually quite powerful platform

403
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
um you could call securex a soar

404
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
a security orchestration

405
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,040
automation and response platform uh

406
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,160
there are

407
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,480
discussions you can have whether we are

408
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,440
sore

409
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,560
um

410
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
uh but we're definitely not a sim

411
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
um and in a lot of organization we can

412
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
actually replace sim uh or

413
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
there is no need for a sim because we

414
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
only pull the data when we

415
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
when we have to directly from the

416
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,000
products so we leave the data at

417
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,040
where it's being generated

418
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
now an important piece

419
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,440
without going too much into detail

420
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
unnecessary detail

421
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,680
is ctim and ctip is probably one of the

422
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,279
most important things

423
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,560
that is foundation of securex and this

424
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,279
is basically a data model it stands for

425
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,360
cisco threat intelligence model and

426
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
this allows us to describe threat

427
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,160
intelligence now don't look at all the

428
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
details here but you'll probably hear me

429
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,160
say observable ones an observable is

430
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,560
basically a uh

431
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,320
can be a domain name ipad rs etc and all

432
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
of these objects data objects that you

433
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
see here they can have a relationship

434
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,839
with observables or or observables can

435
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,880
be a part

436
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,079
of those objects

437
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,279
and a verdict and judgments so judgment

438
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,680
is hey this ipdress is bad so

439
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,279
a judgment

440
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,400
can be about an observable a verdict can

441
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,119
be like hey we have five judgments but

442
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,280
this is our final verdict

443
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,400
exciting means hey this was seen in my

444
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
organization someone reached out to that

445
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,240
observable

446
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
we have a couple of others we'll talk

447
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,799
about that later but just know that this

448
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,880
data model is very important

449
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,919
because

450
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,919
you have

451
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,480
dozens hundreds of security products

452
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
that all use their own data model

453
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
and if you want to be a platform you

454
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
need to have a standardized reliable

455
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
model where you can translate everything

456
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
into and in the end that's what we do

457
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,840
with securex we translate back and forth

458
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,679
in ctim

459
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,960
which allows us to do that

460
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
cross-referencing because everyone

461
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
speaks the same language within air

462
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
quotes

463
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,320
so you can also recognize ctim in

464
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
securex threat response

465
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
for example you can see the judgments

466
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,640
verdicts sightings

467
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,120
sightings or target sightings

468
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
actually show up as a target

469
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
and this basically means it's a sighting

470
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
which actually has a host device

471
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,240
of your organization for example

472
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
a

473
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,720
iphone or a macbook or a server which

474
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,720
has actually reached out to a domain or

475
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,520
something similar like that so targets

476
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,919
and sightings are very important because

477
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
if we have them it means we need to

478
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,918
probably do some more investigation

479
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,480
now we can also interact with ctm from

480
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,679
the api obviously so everything is qrx

481
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,679
is built on top of apis

482
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,039
um it's built with open api spec

483
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,320
and it uses um

484
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,039
oauth2 as authentication

485
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,919
so standardized api methods

486
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,440
and you can also interact with the

487
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
swagger ui or i think it's called the

488
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,000
open api explorer now

489
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
you can also interact with it and here

490
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,240
you'll see some raw

491
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
ctim json and this is how you describe

492
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,280
observables in json you give it the

493
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,919
value and the type

494
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
um

495
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,760
now obviously you can also interact with

496
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,760
cetin from a vide api in python or in

497
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
any language that can do an api call

498
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
so here you see a couple of examples of

499
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,480
that

500
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,919
um

501
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,440
so

502
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,280
yeah that is all quite interesting

503
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
ways of interacting with cetin

504
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
i see the arrows stayed behind but this

505
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,679
is in

506
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,280
just to show you a

507
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,600
workflow that you could use in threat

508
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
response

509
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,160
is you can use intel sources case book

510
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,200
or incidents as basically source of your

511
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,039
investigation

512
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,320
from there securex will pull information

513
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,159
from all kinds of threat intelligence

514
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,200
sources

515
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,600
but also from local

516
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,000
threat intelligence so has it been seen

517
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
in your environment

518
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
and finally you could actually take

519
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,919
actions like blocking something

520
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
all from threat response

521
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,559
and all of this

522
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,440
because it's api first built we can also

523
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
do from python and uh yeah that is uh

524
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
quite interesting

525
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,159
yeah so now let's talk more about

526
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
integrating with securex so i talked

527
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
about the apis i just also wanted to

528
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
mention two other ways that you can

529
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,880
integra integrate with securex

530
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
in

531
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,559
in the end everything works based on the

532
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,919
api so number one is the real one

533
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,720
but you can use securex orchestration

534
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,200
as a load to no code orchestrator which

535
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
is now inside of securex to interact

536
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
with these apis in a

537
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
low to no code way so you don't need to

538
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,520
actually write any syntax

539
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,600
you still need to know sort of how

540
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,559
programmability works of course

541
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,480
but that is also a great way to get

542
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
started and finally we also have securex

543
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,039
relay modules

544
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,799
this is the most native way of

545
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,679
integrating with securex it is built on

546
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,880
top of the securex apis

547
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,320
and it allows you to add an extra module

548
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,120
which is being queried and basically all

549
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,280
our third-party integrations

550
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,919
they uh work with these securex relay

551
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,240
modules and all of our products in the

552
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,679
end as well

553
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,760
probably they just built in a relay

554
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,360
module into the amp cloud for example

555
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,080
but they all work in a similar way

556
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
the relay modules is all open source so

557
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,559
you can find it on github there is a

558
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,760
cisco security github which we can share

559
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
in the in the chat

560
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,400
um

561
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,559
and actually if you're interested into

562
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,960
looking into that and maybe you are here

563
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,120
from engineering and you're like hey

564
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,400
let's see if we can integrate our

565
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
product into it i would definitely check

566
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,919
that out and on developer.cisco.com

567
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,960
securex we actually have a learning lab

568
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
that teaches you to work with the apis

569
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
the orchestrator or with the relay

570
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,440
modules so all of these methods

571
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,840
um all right so now we talked about

572
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
threat hunting we talked about securex

573
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
and threat response now let's more dive

574
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
into an actual use case

575
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
where we're going to combine fret

576
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,080
hunting with securex

577
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
and the first one is going to be twitter

578
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,360
and

579
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,000
probably you all know twitter or use

580
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
twitter

581
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,400
and we're going to ingest twitter to

582
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
look for threat intelligence then we're

583
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,400
gonna do automated

584
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,280
uh enrichment and we're gonna take some

585
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,840
actions and i'm gonna also attempt to do

586
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
a live demo

587
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,320
but everything will be around open deer

588
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
i'm not sure if you guys uh know the

589
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,880
hashtag open there but it's quite an

590
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,480
interesting hashtag because it's used by

591
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,520
um

592
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,280
yeah basically how they call it white

593
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
hat hackers or

594
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
ethical hackers

595
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,840
or

596
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,158
cyber security analysts to basically

597
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
make a new

598
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,919
research about

599
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,600
fresh malware

600
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
available to the public

601
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,400
here's an example of the timeline this

602
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,280
was a while ago but as you can see i'm

603
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
searching for the hashtag open there

604
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,360
and you can find people posting like hey

605
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,640
this domain

606
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,000
i found is actually malicious

607
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,400
or here hey these are the addresses

608
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,440
they're trying to exploit from this

609
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
so that's actually quite interesting

610
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,960
as a demo

611
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
i actually did this

612
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
tweet uh

613
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,600
what was this like an hour and a half

614
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,480
ago

615
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
and we're gonna try in my in my demo to

616
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,000
also find this

617
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,760
and specifically we're gonna look for

618
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,440
this observable

619
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,360
which can be a malicious

620
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
observable actually it is a militia is

621
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,960
observable

622
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
um so i did this tweet let me quickly

623
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,960
jump over actually to show you it live

624
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
here's that tweet i also

625
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,240
tagged

626
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,760
stuart into it i see here he might have

627
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,880
quoted it as well so we're gonna see um

628
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,679
what this demo looks like um with this

629
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,720
live tweet uh there are actually many

630
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
tweets out there as you can see

631
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,840
so uh they they're not necessarily i

632
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,320
think a couple of them per day but still

633
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,360
too much information uh to check

634
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
uh like

635
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,559
every day right um

636
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,559
or every hour so you want to automate

637
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,159
stuff like this

638
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,080
um

639
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,880
so

640
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,520
we're gonna try and find that so i've

641
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,159
built a script that does exactly this so

642
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,679
the first time the script runs it's

643
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,159
gonna retrieve all the tweets possible

644
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,600
from that hashtag

645
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,880
you can also add more hashtags obviously

646
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
it's then going to parse and clean the

647
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,320
tweets

648
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
if it wasn't the first time the script

649
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,159
runs it will actually check if there's

650
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,480
new tweets available i'll talk to you a

651
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
little bit about the twitter api

652
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,600
um but you can sort of say oh give me

653
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
only the tweets that i've that have been

654
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
tweeted

655
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,360
since

656
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
this time

657
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
probably you want to run it every day or

658
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,360
every couple of hours

659
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,120
if there are no new tweets we're going

660
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,480
to sleep and we're going to wait until

661
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,360
the scheduled interval hits again

662
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
now we're going to then

663
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
actually retrieve observables with the

664
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
securex inspect api and this is an api

665
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,480
that you can give a blob of text and it

666
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,039
will give you back domains app addresses

667
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,600
file hashes that it finds into it email

668
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,120
addresses it's a very powerful regex api

669
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,919
basically which securex fit response

670
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,760
uses a lot

671
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
it will uncheck are there any

672
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,880
observables

673
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
if so we're gonna enrich these

674
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,120
observables if not we're going to skip

675
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
the tweets

676
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
and we're going to

677
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
give some user feedback now this is

678
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,799
important

679
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,360
when we actually find observables in the

680
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,080
tweet we enrich the data and we find

681
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,039
that we actually have target sightings

682
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,039
in our environment

683
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,679
this is interesting because this means a

684
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
ethical hacker tweeted about a new

685
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,360
domain name for example like i just did

686
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,960
and someone in your organization

687
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
actually

688
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,960
made a connection to that domain

689
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
what we then do is we create a case in

690
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
case book in securex and we send a webex

691
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,360
teams alert with a high priority tag

692
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,320
if not we'll still create a case you can

693
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,640
actually turn this off

694
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,400
and we'll send a webex teams alert but

695
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,960
it probably requires less work or no

696
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,039
work because you don't have anyone in

697
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,679
your organization who reached out to it

698
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,360
now if there are any more tweets in the

699
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,600
queue we're gonna go like this if not

700
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,679
it's going to sleep so this is sort of

701
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,600
what the script looks like

702
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
um

703
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
this is the result which you'll get so

704
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,320
you get a high priority tweet you'll see

705
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
that my tweet is actually here if you

706
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,960
click on this link it will jump to the

707
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,840
actual uh

708
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,799
tweets

709
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,639
and it will do the research

710
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,640
you can actually investigate this and it

711
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,200
will find if someone reached out to that

712
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,480
observable

713
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,600
um if someone did uh you'll you'll get

714
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
this and i'll

715
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,399
i'll actually post the tweet in um webex

716
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,360
teams

717
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
and then say like hey you have from the

718
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,080
amp module three targets three different

719
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
targets so you probably want to check

720
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
this out quickly

721
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,279
now let's go over to the demo

722
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,840
so on the basis of this we have the

723
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,559
twitter search api

724
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,520
um and it just allows you to basically

725
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,440
query um

726
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
hashtags etc if you want to get access

727
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,320
to this it's definitely cool you do need

728
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,039
to get a developer account on twitter

729
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,520
you can just request this and say hey

730
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,919
i'm doing research or whatever

731
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,919
uh and i'm not going to use it for

732
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,840
commercial purposes

733
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,639
and and they will give access to it

734
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
and let me jump to the actual script

735
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,720
here is the python script uh

736
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,440
in i'm not gonna walk with you through

737
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
every line

738
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,279
i just want to mention to you that all

739
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,480
of it is on my github here

740
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,039
so you can check it out i think we can

741
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,600
also drop a link in the um

742
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,919
in the chat and basically i explain you

743
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,080
everything how to install it etc it's

744
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,679
not that hard if you understand python

745
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,240
but basically i have a config file with

746
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,200
three different

747
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,760
[Music]

748
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,799
parts one for fret response webex and

749
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,760
twitter

750
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,360
and this synth id is definitely

751
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
important

752
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,039
per default it's set to zero but the

753
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,640
first time you run

754
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,360
it will be set to i think it's using the

755
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,320
epoch time or whatever higher epoch time

756
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,520
however you pronounce that

757
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,840
and it will use that

758
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,520
to see if you need to find new tweets

759
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,880
um so now let's actually run it right um

760
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,440
because you wanna um

761
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
uh yeah we wanna find more tweets so i

762
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,120
do need to do one thing and luckily

763
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,919
we're internal i need i just ran this

764
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,039
earlier

765
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,159
um and i want to set it to zero again

766
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,480
oops

767
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
and we're gonna run the file

768
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,840
so you see that the config file was uh

769
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,960
loaded you see a new tweet was detected

770
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,919
um

771
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,320
and what it's gonna do now is

772
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
uh it's going to

773
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,279
clean the clean the tweets

774
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,720
find observables find

775
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,200
sightings if there are any and if if

776
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,480
there are

777
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,440
it will then create a case in case book

778
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,159
and send a webex team's message so you

779
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,799
see here that actually since i

780
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,240
tweeted you see now that i was retweeted

781
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,679
as well

782
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,520
and probably the tweet after this will

783
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
be my tweet that i did just before the

784
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,360
session

785
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,440
and you see here that

786
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,159
stuart clark that his tweet was parsed

787
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,880
so what you can see here is that uh

788
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
they're actually being created and you

789
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,600
see here this is my tweet by crisco

790
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,840
devnet

791
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,720
and not all of them are high priority so

792
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,279
this one is not high priority this one

793
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,760
is because there are actual target

794
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,200
sightings now this one doesn't have that

795
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,919
what we can actually do is from here i

796
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,039
could start immediately in investigation

797
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:07,919
um

798
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,080
i i can also

799
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,919
for the sake of the environment let's

800
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,799
not burn more cycles than needed

801
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,919
you've seen

802
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,559
how it goes what we can also do is we

803
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,640
can find them here of course

804
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,519
so here we are in securex and we have

805
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,080
casebook and here you see actually all

806
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,480
of them being added

807
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,679
now you see

808
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,039
my and stuart tweets being high priority

809
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,640
because that tweet

810
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,559
contains

811
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,679
um

812
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,000
internetbadguys.com and

813
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,519
internetbadguys.com

814
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,200
is actually

815
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,039
something that i've triggered an alert

816
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,919
on earlier in my demo environment

817
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,240
so this is quite interesting you see

818
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,039
obviously also a couple of other tweets

819
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,600
so you can check them out here

820
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
if they are interesting you can still

821
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,039
investigate them

822
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,120
so you can click on investigate

823
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,720
but probably we're not going to find any

824
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,279
targets because we already did this

825
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,260
investigation with

826
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,480
[Music]

827
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,000
the api so we actually

828
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,720
saved a lot of work here for our

829
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,600
security operations center workers

830
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,000
because they don't need to manually grab

831
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,919
data from that tweet

832
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,120
and then

833
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,679
put it in threat response and see if we

834
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,480
have targets all they need to do is they

835
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,120
need to monitor this space and whenever

836
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,519
something with high priority comes in

837
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,279
they need to click the link and it will

838
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,600
automatically start that

839
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,840
investigation as you can see here

840
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,960
um so um yeah i i hope this was a cool

841
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,159
demo um i already always really like it

842
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,480
because you can do a live tweet and it

843
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
will actually find it if you add that

844
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,600
hashtag i don't want to convolute this

845
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,080
so i do always add

846
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,320
something that is actually malicious

847
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
i don't want to be adding google.com or

848
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,799
whatever here in case some peop some

849
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,200
other person is doing something with

850
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,720
this api

851
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,399
so again uh everything is on um my

852
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,600
github

853
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,559
which is over here um and you can

854
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
definitely check it out if you're

855
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,519
interested

856
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,360
into it uh

857
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,320
basically

858
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,559
there's a lot of functions which you can

859
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,640
just take from me

860
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
um

861
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
and reuse as you see fit

862
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,559
uh and you can just use different

863
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,279
sources than tweets uh right

864
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,840
um in the end this is where that magic

865
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,039
happens where i'm doing um checking if

866
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,760
we have return sightings or not

867
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
if there are zero

868
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
which is usually the case hopefully

869
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,159
um we'll just send a normal message

870
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,200
and otherwise we'll send the high

871
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,880
priority message as you can see here

872
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,679
uh it actually took me quite a while to

873
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,640
to make all of this uh this markdown

874
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,760
which was quite fun to work with

875
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,519
to make sure that you get that line and

876
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,040
etc

877
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,679
um all right so this brings me to the

878
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,079
second use case which will be a bit bit

879
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,239
shorter because i'm not going to do as

880
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
expensive

881
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,639
of a demo on this one

882
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,079
but i do want to share this this one so

883
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,760
talos

884
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,839
intelligence

885
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,679
probably is known to everyone but is

886
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,960
cisco's threat intelligence

887
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,760
um organization

888
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,480
have a pretty epic blog um where they

889
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,040
post uh blog posts about

890
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,159
new malware campaigns they sometimes are

891
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,119
like referenced in new york times etc

892
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,359
when there's a new outbreak so they're

893
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
they're really cool

894
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,960
now you could say why would i care about

895
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,359
that blog because everything that's in

896
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
that blog is already blocked by cisco

897
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,560
right

898
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,680
well

899
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,640
it could be if something is a zero day

900
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,880
and there is being blocked about and

901
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
someone

902
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
uh reached out to that

903
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
domain or an pdrs or file hash 29 days

904
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,839
ago or whatever the time limit is on

905
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,040
that product

906
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,280
you might get a hit from a while back

907
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,800
which still is very important

908
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
so what we're going to do is we're going

909
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,960
to use this as a source as well

910
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,800
this is a little bit of an older

911
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,040
screenshot as you can see this is the

912
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,599
first iteration of my script

913
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,440
they post a couple of blog posts per

914
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,400
week

915
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,599
um often they contain insights

916
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,520
and they contain many interesting

917
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
observables as you can see here at the

918
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
bottom

919
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,880
also called indicators of compromise

920
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
and now there's many more blogs out

921
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
there like talos

922
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
so um yeah here you see those

923
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
observables

924
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,280
so how can anyone keep track of n

925
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,079
following certain hashtags and certain

926
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,440
blog posts

927
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,760
how can you do that and also respond to

928
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,640
alerts well the answer is you can't

929
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
unless you maybe can hire a hundred

930
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,000
people

931
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,400
so i did a very similar script i'm gonna

932
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,960
go a little bit um

933
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,839
more

934
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,440
quick through it

935
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,040
um

936
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,599
but basically the blog

937
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
the tweet is now a blog

938
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,079
and we can go through multiple blog

939
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,880
posts actually so i've also added 40

940
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,520
guard from fortinet and unit 42 from

941
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,320
palo alto as well which are obviously

942
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,240
our competitors

943
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,200
but

944
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,359
i mean they might also have interesting

945
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,160
information that we should look at

946
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,839
um

947
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,400
so yeah here you just see uh some code

948
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,200
snippets uh when we're creating a case

949
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,520
in case book uh how simple that is all

950
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,920
you need to give it is some json

951
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,640
and we're basically doing a post uh with

952
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,680
that json a message

953
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,480
um

954
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,119
or json payload i mean

955
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,680
um and this is basically how to extract

956
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,960
observables

957
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,440
so what this is that inspect api

958
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,760
endpoint that i talked about earlier

959
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,000
we can give that broad text as you can

960
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,160
see here and even

961
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
a defanged ip address as it's sometimes

962
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,240
called

963
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,560
we are able to parse out as observables

964
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,960
so all you need to do is send that blob

965
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,839
of text as data payload and it will

966
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,560
return you observables in the exact

967
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,079
ctm data format that we need

968
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,520
all right so

969
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,200
i'm not going to show you the entire

970
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,760
demo of this but i do wanted to share

971
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
with you

972
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,839
uh that this is also on github uh there

973
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,079
is a demo which you can watch

974
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,320
um but we're nearing the end

975
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,800
also that presentation i think the demo

976
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,760
is

977
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,040
what is it 15 minutes or something yep

978
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,920
so let's not check that 50 minutes right

979
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,800
now

980
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,960
um but i just wanted to mention i have a

981
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
similar config

982
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,599
file like i did with

983
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,040
the twitter

984
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,160
script

985
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,040
but what i do here is i loop through rss

986
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,920
feeds

987
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
and

988
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,240
what i then do is i grab the body of a

989
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,760
block and send that as raw text to the

990
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,000
inspect api just to show you how

991
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,320
powerful that is

992
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,960
and i do that for all of these

993
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
and similarly um

994
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,440
[Music]

995
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,119
like with the twitter api there is

996
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,079
an rss feed that i or

997
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,800
python rss

998
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,440
forgot the name of it

999
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,119
it's called feed parser this is

1000
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,359
basically a python library or python

1001
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,480
module

1002
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
which you can import

1003
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,200
and it will actually be able to look at

1004
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,079
some metadata of an rss feed

1005
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,880
so that you only import the latest blog

1006
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,200
post and that is again a measure i took

1007
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,599
against noise you don't want to

1008
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,920
import the same one twice

1009
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
and um

1010
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
just to show you how that works

1011
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,560
as soon as the script runs it will

1012
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,200
actually write that this here this is

1013
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,640
for twitter

1014
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
but i'm doing the exact same thing

1015
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,119
for um

1016
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,240
the talos blog parser as well

1017
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,079
as you can see here which actually

1018
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,079
renamed to rss feeds since we can do new

1019
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,560
so i'm actually writing the config back

1020
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,160
all the way at the end

1021
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,400
um as you can see here

1022
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,200
so let me just show you um here

1023
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,040
i'm writing the config all the way at

1024
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,119
the end to make sure

1025
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,079
that the uh last e-tec and last modified

1026
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,800
is checked and that is also something

1027
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,480
that i'm checking at the beginning

1028
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,280
has there been a new blog yes

1029
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,920
posted yes or no

1030
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
um all right so i promised this was a

1031
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,200
little bit of a shorter demo um

1032
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,680
but i hope that you believe me that i

1033
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,920
can do the exact same thing

1034
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,720
and actually by the way to prove that

1035
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,480
i think i saw some

1036
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,079
in my case book

1037
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,200
actually

1038
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,960
so here you see

1039
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,640
uh for example

1040
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,079
uh the 40 40 guard rss feed

1041
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,680
and if i scroll further down you'll

1042
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,680
probably see the talos one as well

1043
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,720
um

1044
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,520
so without further ado i'll move to some

1045
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,640
conclusions which i hope you agree with

1046
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,599
um

1047
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,240
um so we're nearing the end of the

1048
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
presentation but i still

1049
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,440
um yeah have some stuff i wanted to show

1050
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,760
is this easier than manually searching

1051
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,880
twitter i'm very curious if you agree uh

1052
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,480
if so i really hope that we can get our

1053
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,240
customers to

1054
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
start working with

1055
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,680
this as well

1056
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,200
and asking

1057
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,839
cisco and our partners to either build

1058
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
stuff for this

1059
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,720
or

1060
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
yeah to do it themselves

1061
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
that would just be awesome

1062
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,760
um

1063
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,400
some other summaries thread hunting is

1064
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
all about gathering data from internal

1065
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,520
monitoring and intelligence or global

1066
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
and local threat intelligence as it

1067
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,079
sometimes is called and then

1068
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,040
cross-referencing it

1069
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,200
threat hunting is not something you just

1070
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,920
do on demand it should be something that

1071
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,680
you continuously do in the back end

1072
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,920
a secure x and securex threat response

1073
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,280
can help with this

1074
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,839
and the securex api definitely can help

1075
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,359
automate a lot of this

1076
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,520
so with that we have also covered the

1077
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,680
conclusion and i hope that this

1078
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,079
statement now makes a little bit more

1079
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,480
sense than in the beginning

1080
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
with that i would like to thank everyone

1081
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
for watching and listening i hope you

1082
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,240
enjoyed the session and learned

1083
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,640
something new if you do have any further

1084
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,960
questions please feel free to reach out

1085
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
thank you very much and have a great

1086
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,560
rest of your day bye
