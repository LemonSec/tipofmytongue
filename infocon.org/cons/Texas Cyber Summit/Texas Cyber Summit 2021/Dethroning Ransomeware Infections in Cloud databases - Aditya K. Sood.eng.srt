1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,440
welcome everyone

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,200
today we are going to talk about

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,280
ransomware in factions in cloud

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,759
databases

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,480
first of all i am very thankful to texas

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,039
cyber summit committee members for

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,240
giving me this opportunity to talk about

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
this research

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,080
i'm also thankful to all of you who are

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,880
attending this talk

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
i hope we are going to have a great time

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
during this talk

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
let's get it started

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,520
before we move further this is some

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,879
disclaimer i want to talk about

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,600
the basic purpose of this research is to

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,440
share the intelligence with the security

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,800
community

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,879
and the target is to strengthen the

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:49,920
efforts

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
to build strong

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,640
prevention and detection solution

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
so that we can subvert these attacks on

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,800
the internet

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,399
and we strictly believe that it is only

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,199
possible when the security community

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,159
comes together and work collaboratively

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
in order to do that we have to share our

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,119
findings we have to share our research

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,880
and that is the basic target

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,320
for the stalkers

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,759
a little

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
brief breakdown of mine

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,520
i've been into this industry for more

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,759
than 13 years now

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,240
i've written two books targeted cyber

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,119
attacks and empirical cloud security

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,040
you can check for my background more at

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
the portal here

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
you know you can connect me with twitter

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
as well

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,159
but the basic purpose to highlight

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,240
the background here is to show that what

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
we are going to discuss we know what it

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
is all about and how we really need to

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
go ahead and solve those problems

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
so what is the agenda today

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,640
at first we are going to look into cloud

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
databases threats and attacks landscape

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
very important to understand

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
what are the new trends and tactics that

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
attackers are opting to target cloud

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,640
databases

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
we will look into some of the root

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
causes of why ransomware infections are

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
happening in cloud databases

57
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
we will look into some of the real world

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
examples

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,519
after that we are going to talk about

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
two tools that we have developed

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
and we will demonstrating those tools

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
against real

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
and live targets on the internet to show

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
how we can detect

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,519
ransomware infections

66
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,800
and then we'll have our questions and

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
queries down the line

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
so this is one of the most important

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,799
and essential artifact in the

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,879
real world these days

71
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
when i say real world

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
in the world of digitalization we are

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
talking about

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,319
the internet

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
the ransomware attacks are rising

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,319
exponentially

77
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,840
and why that is

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
the reasons are as follows

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,360
because data is a new currency you know

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
everybody wants to control the data

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,519
so as the attackers

82
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,879
second is

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,760
why to launch attacks for free

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
if the attackers are going after

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,879
subverting the integrity of internet

86
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,280
and compromising systems

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
they really want some profit out of it

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,360
which means they want monetary gains

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
combining these two factors

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,040
attackers are going after the

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,519
technologies

92
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,319
exactly how the data is stored

93
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,760
processed

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
and transmitted

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
one or the other way they want to

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,000
control the data

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and the main reason is data is a new

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
currency

99
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,319
in the world of digitalization whoever

100
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,238
controls the data controls the money

101
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,918
flow and that is the reality

102
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,840
well that also

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,400
enhances the

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
security challenges for the

105
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
organizations as well

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
because attackers are very much focused

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
and whenever they design a malicious

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
code they run designing in the form of

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
ransomware

110
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,639
basically we're going to infect your

111
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
systems we're going to install

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,080
ransomware

113
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
we're going to control your data

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
and at last you have to pay us the

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,919
ransom

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
in order to get your data back

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
so i control your data

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,280
you pay me the money

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,199
and then is all

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
as well

121
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,479
that is the reality of the

122
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,680
attacks on the internet

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
that's why ransomware attacks are

124
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,479
increasing

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,359
at a rapid pace

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
so let's look into some of the cloud

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
databases

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,440
in this spot you can clearly see some of

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,240
the

130
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
media titles that i have picked up

131
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
related to elastic search

132
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,880
you know how elastic servers are

133
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
compromised how attackers are launching

134
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,840
attacks against these

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,080
services and more importantly deploying

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
ransomware in the elastic search

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
instances

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
basically they are going to control the

139
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
data they are going to control the

140
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
search engine capabilities that

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,960
elasticsearch provides

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
so that you won't be able to get a

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
access to your data

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,919
and ransomware is actually is not the

145
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,199
only one

146
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,840
attack that these cloud databases are

147
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
encountering these days there are many

148
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
more

149
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
but for us we are going to focus on

150
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,159
ransomware primarily

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
and you can clearly see you know

152
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,520
hackers are targeting elasticsearch a

153
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
lot these days

154
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,880
and this is one of a severe problem as

155
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
well so categorizing elastic search into

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,039
cloud databases

157
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,840
is nothing new

158
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
now

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
on similar

160
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
note

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,479
we have another cloud database

162
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,400
threads and attack landscape if we want

163
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,080
to look into is the mongodb

164
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
again some of these

165
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
titles and news

166
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
headlines actually highlight how severe

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
the problem is

168
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,240
cloud databases are under attack by

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,840
attackers

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
they want to control the data as we

171
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,800
discussed earlier

172
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,280
and once they do that you know they are

173
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
in full control

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
so that's why these

175
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
adversaries or attackers they are going

176
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
after

177
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,599
cloud databases

178
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
so if you just look at from the

179
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,560
technology point of view both

180
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
elasticsearch and mongodb

181
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,000
databases are nosql one you know in

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
elasticsearch we have an unstructured

183
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,360
data so that they can query it

184
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,479
efficiently

185
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,080
similarly with mongodb you know

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,800
json-based documents are stored

187
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
with proper collections and you have to

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,120
search through these collections

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
to do the interaction with the database

190
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,599
so if the attackers control that

191
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,160
collection in mongodb

192
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,759
you know they are going to control the

193
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,199
data

194
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
and of course they are going to encrypt

195
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,160
it so that you won't be able to recover

196
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,879
it

197
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,599
and which we'll going to see

198
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,639
in some time as well

199
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
since we have seen the threats and

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,520
attack landscape for elasticsearch and

201
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,840
mongodb

202
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
which means

203
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
in this particular talk

204
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,039
we are going to focus on ransomware

205
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,560
infections

206
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,199
that are targeting elasticsearch

207
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,840
and mongodb

208
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
our focus

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,360
will be these two cloud databases

210
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
highlighting

211
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,520
how ransomware are going to exploit

212
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
these

213
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,799
and how we have done definitive research

214
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,679
to detect infections

215
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,838
in these two specific cloud databases

216
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
so as a part of this research

217
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
we'll be discussing in detail about our

218
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,959
two different tools

219
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,560
but let's first understand

220
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
what are the root causes for this trend

221
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
severe infections

222
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
primarily targeting cloud databases

223
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
there are many reasons for that

224
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
let's go through some of them to

225
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
understand why this is a problem

226
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
here i have listed couple of reasons

227
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
which actually initiates the ransomware

228
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
deployment in cloud databases which

229
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
means how attackers are going to

230
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,600
compromise cloud databases what are the

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
reasons

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
they are able to successfully infect

233
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,199
these cloud databases with ransomware

234
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,760
one of the main reasons for that is the

235
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
exposed database administrative

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
interfaces

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
during deployments administrators

238
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,040
not pay much attention to the security

239
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,120
and as a result of that

240
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
the configuration stays in secure

241
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
which actually result in exposing

242
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
database administrative interface

243
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,760
whether it's on different protocol

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,240
communication channels such as http or

245
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,640
https or others whatever they support

246
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,760
they are exposed on the internet

247
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,519
and if they are exposed on the internet

248
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,200
you know attackers are in a very well

249
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
situation to go after fingerprint them

250
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
and try to exploit them

251
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,399
it makes

252
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
the situation more worse

253
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,279
when administrators use weak and default

254
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,440
passwords as well

255
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
or maybe running the interface in an

256
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,959
anonymous mode

257
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,040
so attackers can easily launch

258
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
credential cracking and try to gain a

259
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
complete access to the database

260
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,320
administrative panels

261
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,200
another way attackers going after these

262
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
cloud databases because they are running

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
on specific network services these

264
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
services are not secure in itself

265
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,040
for example tcp based services that are

266
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
sporting the communication with the

267
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
mongodb instant are exposed again on the

268
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
internet

269
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
attackers what they do they try to

270
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,040
interact with this network service try

271
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,839
to fingerprint what are the inherent

272
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,399
database software

273
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
is being deployed

274
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,120
and they try to

275
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
map that and try to figure out any

276
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,200
vulnerabilities that exist with them and

277
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
of course they are going to go after

278
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
exploits after that

279
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,079
to exploit any inherent vulnerability

280
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
that is present

281
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,800
and then take a complete control of the

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,959
network service and at the end and

283
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,319
itself is the cloud database

284
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,720
another reason that adds to the

285
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,120
compromise of cloud databases

286
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,519
is via indirect channel

287
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,000
which means attackers first you know

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,720
compromise the end user system

289
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,279
to in fact the cloud instances

290
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,880
you know we have standard attacks like

291
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,440
drive by downloads you know and then

292
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
many other ways

293
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
phishing attacks you know

294
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
their attackers are able to install

295
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
malicious payloads on the end user

296
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,160
systems

297
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
and when these end user systems are

298
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,200
interacting with the cloud services

299
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
they try to control them

300
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
through lateral spreading

301
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,839
or other different techniques

302
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
but in this case is that

303
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,519
attackers are going after end user

304
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,839
systems first and then targeting cloud

305
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,000
databases

306
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
again as i mentioned lateral movement is

307
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,680
the most important

308
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
technique

309
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,279
that is being used here

310
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,720
because once the malicious code is

311
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
running on the end user system it

312
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,600
becomes way easier for the attackers

313
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,040
to exploit

314
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
or map other systems in the same

315
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
environment

316
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
and that actually contributes

317
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,079
further to the

318
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,320
compromise of cloud databases running in

319
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
the cloud environment

320
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,959
as we discuss social engineering attacks

321
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,480
of course these are indirect way to

322
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
compromise end user systems and taking

323
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839
that route to target the cloud instances

324
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
running on the

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
environment

326
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
so the these are

327
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,800
most important

328
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
ideas that we really need to understand

329
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,040
here how attackers are kind of going

330
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,360
after

331
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
cloud databases

332
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,360
in order to install ransomware

333
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
attackers can go after any

334
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
technique

335
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
but as a security

336
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,959
researchers

337
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,639
or engineers

338
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,800
we really need to be cautious on each

339
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
and every front

340
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
so that their appropriate security

341
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
controls are deployed to circumvent

342
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,360
these attacks

343
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,839
but that is a reality

344
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,360
now since now we have understood how

345
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,440
exactly ransomware is deployed in cloud

346
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
databases how attackers are exploiting

347
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,760
the integrity of network services

348
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
in order to control

349
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,480
now we really need to understand

350
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,720
how infections look like in real world

351
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
let's move forward

352
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,279
so what we are going to look right now

353
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,320
is

354
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
how the infectious

355
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
are being triggered in cloud databases

356
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,399
and how exactly

357
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,079
ransomware

358
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,680
infections

359
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,720
are mapped into these databases

360
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
we are going to take a look into two or

361
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,399
three different examples here

362
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
since we are focused on elasticsearch

363
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,040
and mongodb we are going to look

364
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
into examples

365
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,279
of infected elastic search

366
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,240
and infected mongodb instances

367
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
with ransomware

368
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
i try to understand

369
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
how in real world

370
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
these infections are triggered

371
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,360
so let's take a look into first example

372
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,360
so this one is an example related to

373
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,839
elastic

374
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,800
search clarence dance

375
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
the highlighted details here reflect

376
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
if your elastic search instance is

377
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
infected

378
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
how attackers are leaving ransom

379
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
messages

380
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,160
in the infected instance

381
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
in this case you can clearly see the

382
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,959
message

383
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,680
highlights all your data is backed up

384
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,839
as we discussed earlier data is a new

385
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,360
currency

386
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
which means like the attackers have

387
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
taken a backup and they have actually

388
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,000
encrypted the existing state of the data

389
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
and they are asking for the bitcoin

390
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,959
in a specific time period if you want to

391
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,480
recover it

392
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
if you're not able to provide that money

393
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,399
you're not able to recover your data

394
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,959
which will significantly impact

395
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,239
the running services

396
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,240
and in fact

397
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,160
the brand of the organizations as well

398
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,600
if you are they're not able to control

399
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
the data because it will substantially

400
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
results in

401
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,518
security breach

402
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
now take a look into the another example

403
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
here

404
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
so this example is specifically for

405
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,079
mongodb

406
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,359
now you can clearly see

407
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
it is talking about a one specific

408
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,759
database

409
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,079
here

410
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,079
and what kind of different collections

411
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,479
it has

412
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,720
so the collections

413
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,279
are named as system.indexes as well as

414
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
readme so the most important part here

415
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
is the readme

416
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
and the database name project like

417
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,600
readme to recover your data

418
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,599
so what's inside readme is the key here

419
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,520
which we potentially map it to as an

420
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,359
again a ransomware message

421
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,160
but

422
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
subsequently you can figure it out if

423
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,679
you scan the databases

424
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,799
that are available in mongodb and

425
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,240
related

426
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
collections in it you will able to

427
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,640
understand

428
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
where exactly the ransom

429
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,840
message is being

430
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,360
left and what the demands of the

431
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
attacker is

432
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
in this particular case this actually

433
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
suggests

434
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
that how

435
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,039
brand severe infections are occurring in

436
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
mongodb instances

437
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
and with the previous example you will

438
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
see how the similar

439
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,080
infections are happening in

440
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,520
elasticsearch instances

441
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,400
since we are focused primarily on two

442
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
databases

443
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,919
elasticsearch and mongodb

444
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
so we really need to come up with the

445
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,919
way to detect

446
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,600
the ransomware interactions on the fly

447
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,880
which means

448
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
we really need to automate this process

449
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
so let's move forward

450
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,679
to talk a bit more about it

451
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
in this sections we are going to focus

452
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,320
on

453
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
two different tools

454
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
that we have designed

455
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,880
the tools actually allow us

456
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,679
to detect these infections

457
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,600
running on remote

458
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
instances of elasticsearch and mongodb

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,919
on the internet

460
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,960
and we can

461
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
use this for internal research purposes

462
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,360
as well as building some strong

463
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
prevention solutions as well

464
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
but these tools gives you the capability

465
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
to just detect

466
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
it even as a part of your vulnerability

467
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,679
management scenarios or vulnerability

468
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,760
assessment or even a part of penetration

469
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,520
testing exercises

470
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
to detect

471
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
whether these instances running in your

472
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,280
environment are infected with ransomware

473
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,559
or not

474
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,919
so these tools

475
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,919
provide a great capability and that's

476
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,679
what we are going to discuss right now

477
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,880
so the first tool that we are going to

478
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
talk about is traffic

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,840
so stratfor tool provides you the

480
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,280
capability to detect

481
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,760
infected elastic search instances with

482
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,840
ransomware

483
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
so you can clearly see the

484
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
how the tool looks like what kind of

485
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,799
modules it support and you can clearly

486
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
see there is a one module related to

487
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,360
ransomware which will going to

488
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,080
map the elastic set instance

489
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,559
against any potential

490
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,280
infections specifically to ransomware

491
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
and we are going to see that

492
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
in some time

493
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
so the first tool is the stratfor one

494
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
for elasticsearch infections

495
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,039
the second tool is amphilate

496
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,640
it is focused on

497
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
mapping the mongodb instances whether

498
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,440
these instances are in factoring severe

499
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,559
or not

500
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,159
so if you can look at the different

501
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,440
modules

502
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
it's for different modules so it's not

503
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,640
only related to the ransomware

504
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
mapping

505
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
but it's also related to other infection

506
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
scenarios like meo board as well

507
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
you know you can check for admin access

508
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,840
privilege escalation you can dumps

509
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,360
different set of information you can

510
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
verify the authentication

511
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,158
configured

512
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
but our focus is only on the ransomware

513
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,960
in the stock as we have discussed

514
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,960
earlier

515
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,039
both of these tools

516
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,679
will provide you the

517
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,080
power

518
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,720
to run the scans in an automated manner

519
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,360
to unearth infections

520
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,039
in elasticsearch and mongodb instances

521
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,640
running remotely

522
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,080
so let's see how it looks like

523
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,880
so the first example is the stratfor one

524
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,080
ex

525
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,760
exactly the staffer is an action here

526
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
it is detecting

527
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,799
in an automated manner

528
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,559
an elastic search instance which is

529
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
infected with run severe

530
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,679
and how

531
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,559
it basically scans

532
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,918
that exposed interface

533
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,520
and using

534
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,679
built-in heuristics and signatures it

535
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,919
maps rather the system basically the

536
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,159
elasticsearch cloud instance is infected

537
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,200
or not

538
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
as you can clearly see

539
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,840
it is able to detect

540
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,799
that the remote instance is infected and

541
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,679
what kind of ransomware messages being

542
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,240
left there

543
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,720
and that's pretty cool because you can

544
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
just use this tool run against

545
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
elasticsearch instance and then figure

546
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,600
it out

547
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,879
if it has been compromised or not

548
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,320
another example is of anfield

549
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,039
this one is targeted against

550
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,200
a remote instance of

551
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,919
mongodb

552
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,679
if you look

553
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,960
in the

554
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,760
here the output reflects that you know

555
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,120
it is run against the tcp port 27017 and

556
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,840
the module that is enabled is intrusive

557
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
checker and server

558
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,120
so it's going to perform a very

559
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,158
intrusive check here

560
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
what happened in this case is dumping

561
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
the identifiers for all the databases

562
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,200
which means well are the available

563
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,120
databases

564
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
it is readme to recover data admin

565
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
config and the interesting one is the

566
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,600
readme to recover data

567
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,799
so what the tool is gonna do right now

568
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,120
it is going to

569
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,320
scan this database for all the available

570
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
collections

571
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
and try to dump

572
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and check against

573
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,159
the logic that has been embedded in this

574
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,159
tool for detecting

575
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,640
ransomware infection

576
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
and you can see that it is able to

577
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,960
detect this ransomware in faction

578
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,159
highlighting

579
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,000
what is the content of that message

580
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
what is the ask of the attacker and how

581
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
it looks like

582
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,080
so overall

583
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,840
previously you have seen stratfor

584
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
now you have seen anfilate

585
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,600
these are some of the examples

586
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,080
but let's see how these tools act in

587
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,639
real world

588
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,039
now it's a time

589
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,200
to go little bit detail

590
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,000
into the demos

591
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
the first demo that we are going to talk

592
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,760
about

593
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,159
is the stratfor

594
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,559
in the real world

595
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,120
let's take a look

596
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,200
so right now we are going to see

597
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440
stratfor in action against the real

598
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,840
world in stance

599
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,400
it has many modules

600
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,360
but this one what we are going to use is

601
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,399
the ransomware one

602
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
so let's see

603
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,520
so the tool successfully detects the

604
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
infection here

605
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,720
if you can clearly see this is the iep

606
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,320
running on a tcp port 9200

607
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,760
and it detects successfully the

608
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,039
infection in real time

609
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
because the remote elastic search

610
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
instance is infected

611
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,760
so what you can do here

612
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,679
you can download this tool

613
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,799
and you can check for the state of

614
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,200
elasticsearch instances on the internet

615
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,880
you can even create a batch script you

616
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,559
know provide a multiple

617
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,440
inputs for different elastic search

618
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,960
instances that are exposed on the

619
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,840
internet and run this

620
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,919
tool you will be able to find out that

621
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,360
you are

622
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
that those exposed instances of

623
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,039
elasticsearch are infected with

624
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,679
ransomware or not interestingly you can

625
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,360
clearly see there are several patterns

626
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,159
are mapped here bitcoin index readme

627
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,840
data backed up

628
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
bitcoin

629
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,240
account identifier and so on

630
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,440
and once it just calculates a logic

631
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
it scans for

632
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,200
this particular message

633
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,039
and try to

634
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,640
reflect that

635
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,799
the existing state of that elastic

636
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,440
search instance

637
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
so this demo highlights

638
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,679
how exactly staffer provides you a

639
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,520
strong capability

640
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,240
for checking the security state of

641
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,880
elastic search instances

642
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
now

643
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,480
let's move on to the next demo

644
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
in this particular demo

645
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
we are going to run a very intrusive

646
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
check against

647
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,679
remote

648
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,919
instance of mongodb

649
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
infected with ransomware and you will

650
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,120
see how amphilate

651
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,200
helps to detect that in an automated

652
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,520
manner

653
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,080
so let's first take a look into how the

654
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,880
tool

655
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
operates different modules

656
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,520
export

657
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
and all that

658
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,200
so first one we are going to run

659
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,159
potentially a basic check

660
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,120
for ransomware

661
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,039
let's take a look into that

662
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,880
so if you can clearly see

663
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,000
we are utilizing here

664
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,159
27017 tcp port which is being consumed

665
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,760
by mongodb forest network connectivity

666
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
and now what you can see here that we

667
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,120
are able to detect initial fingerprints

668
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,679
and it is a potential way that this

669
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,240
instance is infected so the tool is

670
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,200
saying run aggressive analysis and let's

671
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,520
just run the intrusive check right now

672
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,639
and see how it reacts

673
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,399
so what the tool is now gonna do

674
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,080
it went inside into the database and

675
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,120
check for the available collections

676
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,360
and whether any of that collection is

677
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
infected

678
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
basically the attacker has control that

679
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,200
collection

680
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
and left over some sort of ransomware

681
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,159
message

682
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,640
and now you can clearly see

683
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,520
that

684
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,080
the remote mongodb instance is infected

685
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,760
with ransomware

686
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,919
so we are doing a rerun here right now

687
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,480
to highlight how it works first it was a

688
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
basic check

689
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
it shows that there is some potential in

690
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,279
faction

691
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,960
and then we are running the

692
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,320
intrusive check

693
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,520
which means that gold detail into it

694
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,760
figure it out what it is and then show

695
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
me whether this

696
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,360
mongodb instance is infected or not

697
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
now you have seen then a real world

698
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,000
example and a demo of

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
detecting ransomware and factions

700
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,440
against mongodb

701
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
so just imagine you have these two

702
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,080
two different tools available for you

703
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,720
stratfor for elasticsearch

704
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
and

705
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,840
inflate for

706
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,399
mongodb

707
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,080
you can utilize it for a security

708
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,679
research purposes

709
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,480
generating threat intelligence

710
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,960
launching mass scans for potential

711
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
ransomware infractions and even

712
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,880
conducting penetration testing analyzing

713
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,919
the security posture of your

714
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,000
cloud databases which in this case

715
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,440
are elasticsearch and mongodb

716
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,399
so this is an automated way

717
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,120
of conducting scary assessment

718
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,559
specifically

719
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
highlighting if

720
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,120
these instances are infected or not

721
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
with ransomware

722
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,919
so we develop these two tools

723
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,640
that you can utilize in your regular

724
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,520
work environment

725
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,879
to reap benefits

726
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,600
now

727
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,679
what is the inference here

728
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,240
so we strictly believe that subverting

729
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,559
ransomware infection in cloud databases

730
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,080
require defense and depth strategy

731
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,000
and continuous security assessment in an

732
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
automated manner

733
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
we need automation

734
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,120
the reason for that is the scalability

735
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,679
aspect of it whether it's vertical

736
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,000
whether it's horizontal

737
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,360
you know with that

738
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,200
with exponential increase of

739
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
clouds

740
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,520
and

741
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,919
are moving towards cloud technologies

742
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,399
they really need a strong infrastructure

743
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,120
to support that for that they have to

744
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,519
scale and if they have to scale so as

745
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,240
the security has to scale

746
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,120
so in order to conduct

747
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,440
and build a strong security posture we

748
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,120
really need to go after continuous

749
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,039
security assessment and that is only

750
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,000
possible by automation

751
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,760
in this particular talk when we

752
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,840
discussed about how ransomware

753
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,360
infections are

754
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,799
geared up

755
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,039
and attackers are targeting cloud

756
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,960
databases

757
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,440
which are basically the lower building

758
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,840
blocks for any kind of different sas

759
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,120
applications and other variety of

760
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,840
applications

761
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,640
protecting and securing these cloud

762
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,080
databases are of utmost importance

763
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,600
and for that

764
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,240
we really really need to go after

765
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,799
assessing the security postures

766
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,399
of these cloud databases making sure

767
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,799
that these are not being compromised by

768
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,360
attackers

769
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,679
as a crux of the stock

770
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,919
we really need to detect these are not

771
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,279
infected with ransomware

772
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,399
and that should be the target making

773
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,799
sure our data stays secure

774
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,279
and we preserve our e-currency which in

775
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,480
this case is the data

776
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,399
so with that

777
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,240
you can download and fill it and

778
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,039
stratfor tools from these github

779
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,159
wrappers

780
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,840
it's open source you can utilize the

781
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,880
source code the way you want it to be

782
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
and consume it accordingly

783
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,480
so both of these tools are available

784
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,919
on github

785
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,679
go ahead fetch it

786
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,240
use it and share your feedback how you

787
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,000
like it feel free to enhance it as well

788
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,960
love to get your feedback on this

789
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
thereby making sure as a security

790
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
research community we learn from each

791
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,679
other

792
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,919
and that is

793
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,840
our

794
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,320
target should be

795
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,000
so with that

796
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,720
any questions and queries

797
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,760
we can discuss of channel

798
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,120

have your feedback on this one

804
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,440
so that we can take it from

805
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
there i hope

806
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720

gives you the valuable insights

828
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,159
on how to go

829
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,480
detect

830
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,159
and circumvent

831
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,320
ransomware infections at cloud databases

832
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,839
with that thank you very much
