00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,639
good morning good afternoon and good

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,720
evening and thanks for joining us here

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,040
at texas cyber security summit my name

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,200
is patrick lloyd i'm a senior solutions

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,519
architect with cisco security services

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,280
and thank you for joining me for my

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,000
presentation lessons learned zero trust

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,240
for segmentation and iot based smart

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,680
buildings

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,800
let me start off with a brief

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,119
introduction of myself my name is

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,800
patrick lloyd i've been with cisco

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,599
systems for about 11 years now

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
this presentation is a combination of

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,519
things that i've been working on with

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,920
customers related to their their zero

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,480
trust journeys and while i say

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,800
smart building in the title this doesn't

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,480
necessarily mean that you must have a

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,079
smart building to apply a lot of the

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,840
lessons learned here and i'll explain a

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,600
little bit further into the presentation

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,879
why

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,239
i've been very fortunate working for

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
cisco to be able to live all up and down

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,480
the east coast of the united states and

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,559
travel all over the world when i'm not

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,160
traveling you'll see in the center of

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,920
your screen there

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,760
i have my corgi luna the corgi who

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
resides here with me in cary north

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
carolina

33
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,840
i also very much enjoy going to stand-up

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
comedy shows and on the left-hand side

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,960
of your screen you'll see

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,080
me with a couple of my favorite

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
comedians

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
now if you'd like to follow up with

39
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
questions comments concerns or to have a

40
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
discussion around potentially working

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
with you throughout your xero trust

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
journey on the top right hand side of

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
the screen here you'll see a qr code if

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
you scan that qr code it'll start up an

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
email to me please feel free to reach

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,079
out to me for additional information

47
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
so let's talk a little bit about xero

48
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,040
trust

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
and the question always comes up why

50
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,079
should you care

51
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,799
well zero trust in the phrasing of xero

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,280
trust is pretty much like the wild west

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
at this point

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,399
everybody means something different when

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,720
they're talking about zero trust and a

56
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,240
lot of times what they're talking about

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,119
is the implementation of a tool or

58
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,200
something relatively simple that is

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,000
tactical in nature that is meant to help

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,399
secure your organization as opposed to

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,799
meeting an overall business goal

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
what it really comes down to is when we

63
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,799
talk about xero trust we have to be

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,360
focused on what the broader landscape of

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,399
our business goal is it's moving towards

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,239
a white list method

67
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,560
it's starting with the idea of we need

68
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
to understand what devices are currently

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
residing on our network

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
because let's face it the greatest

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
threat to our network right now are

72
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
these little boxes that we have in our

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
pockets because everybody has one and if

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,040
we're not managing them what do we know

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,319
about them

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
on the topic of knowing more information

77
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
about them we also need to develop what

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
i refer to as a contextual identity that

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
contextual identity consists of six

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,200
things

81
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,959
who is on what device in what location

82
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,160
at what time over what medium and what

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,920
vulnerabilities or threats does that

84
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
device pose to our overall network

85
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,959
the only way that we can understand that

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
is understanding what that device is and

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
who's utilizing it but also

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
understanding what resources from the

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
external world that device needs to

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
consume

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,480
in its daily operations

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
but we also need to understand how

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,120
devices on our network interact with one

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,200
another and develop some sort of

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
baseline so that we can understand what

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,440
the vulnerabilities are when they

97
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
present themselves or if that device

98
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
gets compromised in some way shape or

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
form

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
now if that device does get compromised

101
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,959
in some way shape or form we need some

102
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,799
sort of vulnerability management but

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,959
also control point to prevent that

104
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,200
device from infecting the rest of our

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
network we need to minimize the blast

106
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,200
zone as much as possible

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
but all of this is only available if we

108
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,080
have the robust tool set and analysis

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,879
set to give us the ability to identify

110
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,519
the signal within the massive amount of

111
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,959
noise

112
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,720
the biggest challenge that we run into

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,680
today

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
is the landscape of security certainly

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
isn't getting any smaller

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
it's a massive landscape that is only

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
expanding by the day for vendors and

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
products that will promise you zero

119
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,480
trust capabilities

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
so therefore let's jump into a little

121
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
bit about definitions first

122
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
when i'm talking about xero trust i'm

123
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
talking about a solution i'm talking

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
about a set of products or a set of

125
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
capabilities that allow for you to meet

126
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
a business goal

127
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,479
the upgrade to a given product the

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
change in how we configure a given

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
feature is not zero trust

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,800
zero trust really needs to be

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,280
how the set of a large number of

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
products and capabilities play together

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
to solve a business goal like something

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
like software-defined networking like

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
rapid threat containment and when i talk

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
about rapid threat containment i'm

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
referring to the automated ability to

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
identify that a threat is on our network

139
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
identify what device and what user poses

140
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
that threat and then automatically

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
quarantine however i want to do that

142
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,240
whether it be a vlan an acl or kicking

143
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,160
them off of the network altogether with

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
some sort of reject

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
to allow for

146
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,120
me to take that device off my network

147
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
without my administrators having to

148
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
constantly be monitoring for those

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
vulnerabilities

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
now when we talk about zero trust i'm

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
talking about a process not a product

152
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,639
that process has been defined by many

153
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
different vendors in many different ways

154
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,680
cisco defines it as workplace workforce

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
workload and you'll see some references

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,840
to that within the slides today

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
in the patent-pending model that my team

158
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
is working on we're defining that as

159
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
having an overlay that overlay is

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
typically some sort of policy and

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
overall

162
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,080
need to accomplish some sort of business

163
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
goal going back to that solution

164
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,560
phraseology i was talking about before

165
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
then being able to identify what

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,280
endpoints play into

167
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
that overlay how they participate in

168
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,080
that overlay being able to enforce

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
controls that we apply to those devices

170
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,039
within the overlay

171
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,280
managing the vulnerabilities and then

172
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,759
analyzing how those devices are

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,840
interacting with one another gathering

174
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
logs and this becomes a cyclical overall

175
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
process

176
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,400
because let's face it

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
security is a journey it's not going to

178
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,319
be a destination

179
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,319
i'm not going to be able to secure the

180
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,440
network to the best it ever has been

181
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
all i can do is work towards a more

182
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,639
secure posture recursively to get me to

183
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,120
the best place possible without

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
completely shutting down the entire

185
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
business and preventing it from doing

186
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
business as usual

187
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,280
so overall our ultimate goal should be

188
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
to iteratively and recursively continue

189
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
to secure our networks

190
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,560
so

191
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
if you remember nothing else from

192
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,840
today's presentation remember three

193
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,440
things most of our customers have been

194
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,400
working towards zero trust for years

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
and this is with simple mechanisms and

196
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
simple application of inherent

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
networking concepts to prevent devices

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,039
from having a larger than needed blast

199
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,360
zone or being able to identify what

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,039
these devices are with some sort of

201
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,080
network access control product

202
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
xero trust is an evolving process

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
there's always going to be new products

204
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,319
new capabilities new features new

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
configurations that are out there

206
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
but what it really comes down to is can

207
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,240
i identify what those devices are on the

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
network and can i evolve what

209
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,080
capabilities i have to then enforce and

210
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
manage my overall vulnerabilities

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,879
and therefore we start with visibility

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,919
we have to understand what devices are

213
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,240
on the network who is on them where

214
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
they're located what medium what time

215
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
and what vulnerabilities they pose to

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
the network based on that information

217
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,039
that we've gathered

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,120
so let's talk a little bit about the

219
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
journey and by journey i mean let's talk

220
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
about the customer in question here

221
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,560
because this is a real customer we've

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,199
code named them smart building central

223
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
smart building central had the ultimate

224
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
goal of building out the next generation

225
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
smart building

226
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
they wanted to implement connected

227
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,840
elevators the ability to call an

228
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,080
elevator like an uber with an

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,400
application on your phone to say

230
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,440
i'm currently at this desk via built-in

231
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,799
blue dot navigation and i need to get to

232
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,479
the elevator it's going to take me a

233
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
certain amount of time and therefore

234
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,159
there's a calculation done on the back

235
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,159
end to get that elevator to your floor

236
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,399
as quickly as possible and make your

237
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,480
overall working experience as efficient

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
as possible

239
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
dynamic lighting

240
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,279
smart building central was in a very

241
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,320
sunny area of the country and therefore

242
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,959
we wanted the ability to not only dim

243
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,360
the lights inside of the classroom like

244
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
some of the smart home vendors out there

245
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,040
or dim the

246
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
lighting inside of conference rooms when

247
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
someone was presenting but we also

248
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,839
wanted the ability to dim the external

249
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
windows as the sun came up or the sun

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,360
went down so that we could ensure that

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
it was

252
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
comfortable being in the building no

253
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
matter what time of day

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
the built-in navigation that we talked

255
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
about before blue dot navigation to tell

256
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
you if you have to go to this conference

257
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
room for your next meeting here's how

258
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,200
you get there in the best way possible

259
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,279
all digital signage moving towards a

260
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,880
paperless goal

261
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
and then finally guest hot spot

262
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
capabilities

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,920
i've had cios and csos tell me i believe

264
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,160
that internet access for everybody who

265
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
comes into my building is a birthright

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
and therefore we want the ability to

267
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,279
allow for guests to get onto the

268
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,680
internet but also utilize that ability

269
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
to get onto the internet to present

270
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
wirelessly so they never have to connect

271
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,760
anything to their device they just

272
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,839
connect to a smart display

273
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,079
but we also need to minimize or

274
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
eliminate nefarious uses of that

275
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
capability as well

276
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
so when we talk about smart buildings

277
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
we're talking about as close to a at

278
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,680
home fully comfortable

279
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
fully

280
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,839
controllable

281
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
work experience as possible

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,040
we want the ability to sense what the

283
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,839
environment is for our users is it too

284
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,880
warm is it too cold as people increase

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
in a given area how do we change the

286
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
hvac to ensure that our customers

287
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,079
continue to be comfortable in that area

288
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,800
automating that control and influencing

289
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
the thermostat influencing lighting

290
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
conditions etc

291
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
we also wanted to improve physical

292
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
security because one of the most

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
vulnerable pieces of any building

294
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,279
nowadays is

295
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,760
the physical security cameras

296
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
we'll talk a little bit more about that

297
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
in some of the subsequent slides here

298
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,160
but just know that 15 percent of the

299
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,399
worldwide malware outbreaks in 2019 were

300
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,440
because of a connected camera

301
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,079
we wanted the ability to have emergency

302
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,000
management through personnel proximity

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,079
badging using ble or using uh connected

304
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,680
badging to give us the

305
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,519
the understanding of who is in the

306
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,079
building in the time of an emergency and

307
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,399
then also ensure that anybody still in

308
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,800
the building is both accounted for and

309
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
the digital signage can all be changed

310
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,519
to guide those people to the close to

311
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,560
the closest and most available exit

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,279
and then finally those cool little red

313
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,519
green light sensors like you go to the

314
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,079
mall and you see to indicate where you

315
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,480
could park and even be able to pull that

316
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,720
up on the app to determine where the

317
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
most populated areas of the parking

318
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
garage currently are

319
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
because there's a massive benefit to

320
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
this to

321
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,079
our to our customers or to smart

322
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,680
building central

323
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
35

324
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,800
energy reduction allows for smart

325
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
building central to be a better global

326
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
citizen it also allows for them to save

327
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,279
on cost with an 18 overall cost savings

328
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,200
on energy by modifying lighting sunlight

329
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
etc within the building and ensuring

330
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
that when the building is less populated

331
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
we can control the hvac to bring that

332
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
temperature up to a slightly higher

333
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,639
temperature

334
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,600
it's a connected intelligent and secure

335
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
overall building

336
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,560
but smart building central was also

337
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
also had their own customers that they

338
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,240
wanted to show

339
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
what are the

340
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
capabilities what is the art of the

341
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
possible so that they can show off their

342
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,839
products and how they interacted with

343
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,480
how cisco put this together to help them

344
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
be as secure as possible within the xero

345
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,240
trust model

346
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
so an overall increased sale goal as

347
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
well

348
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,519
the problem is we know that risk is

349
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,440
inherent to i.t

350
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
we know that over the past 10 years

351
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
there's been over 300 data breaches

352
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
involving the theft of over a hundred

353
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
thousand records or more

354
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
and it's not getting any easier to

355
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,240
detect when these breaches do occur

356
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,639
the average time to detect a breach is

357
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,959
now at 206 days

358
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,440
granted that's down from a few years ago

359
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,000
but it's still a really long time to

360
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
have a threat existing in your network

361
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
and exfiltrating data on a regular basis

362
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
we know that there's an overall real

363
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,000
estate investment that's being done here

364
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,839
235 million dollars that could be a

365
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,079
better proposition should smart building

366
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,880
central ever want to sell that building

367
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
to another company

368
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,040
but there's also the average cost of the

369
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,079
data breach that's 7.35 million per

370
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,720
incident which could offset that overall

371
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
cost savings or offset the real estate

372
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,880
gains that are made here

373
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,199
and let's face it we don't want to be

374
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,480
the next company on the front page of a

375
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
given media outlet because of our

376
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,680
records exposed

377
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,639
so smart building central's integrations

378
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
gave us the capability to identify

379
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
understand and control

380
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
how these given devices played into the

381
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,199
overall environment and help

382
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,920
secure the building as much as possible

383
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
but we started with one centralized

384
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,600
question

385
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,240
why is this such a challenge

386
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
well to understand why it's a challenge

387
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
we also have to understand how did we

388
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,720
get here in

389
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,519
networking of yesteryear the focus was

390
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
always on connectivity over security

391
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
especially as you got higher up through

392
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,639
reporting chain

393
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,720
interactions it's what we'd like to

394
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,079
refer to sometimes as executive bling

395
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
i had this new device that i just bought

396
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,800
that's hot off the press or hot on the

397
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,519
market i want this on the network i want

398
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,399
the ability to bring my

399
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
smart speaker into the office i want the

400
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,040
ability to get my new tablet onto the

401
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,279
network i want the ability to have this

402
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
smart whiteboard that i can interact

403
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
with and i can show off to other

404
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,760
executives and others within my company

405
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
so it was always get the device on the

406
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,759
network and worry about securing it

407
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,320
later focus on the centralized security

408
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,399
point of the firewall to create rules

409
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,720
for how this device interacted with the

410
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,639
external world but it created a massive

411
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,160
blast zone

412
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,279
it essentially created iot sprawl all

413
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,680
these iot devices that are found all

414
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,279
across our network that we don't

415
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,440
necessarily know how they work on the

416
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
network or what the true baseline of

417
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,399
what success looked like for any of them

418
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,639
which causes issues of

419
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,199
control uh cameras reaching out to their

420
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,279
controllers and

421
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,680
now getting automatic downloads

422
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
well automatic downloads are fine when

423
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,839
we're trying to send recordings to a

424
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,160
network video recorder but what happens

425
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,079
when we can determine what the protocol

426
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
that these cameras utilize to do that

427
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
download are

428
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,560
and we exploit that with some sort of

429
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,120
package that is sent in a corrupted

430
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
firmware or something to that extent

431
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,800
so it comes down to trying to minimize

432
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,199
dynamic discovery which is becoming more

433
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,519
and more popular across all the iot

434
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,480
devices out there so that it's a

435
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,959
zero touch interaction for the

436
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,079
administrator that introduces additional

437
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,199
risk it introduces jump off points and

438
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,480
jump off points all around the overall

439
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
organization no matter how you segment

440
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,079
them off with vlans vrf's

441
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,800
or with firewalls

442
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,040
connected cameras for example as i

443
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,440
mentioned before were fifteen percent of

444
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,799
the overall

445
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,359
compromised iot enabled endpoints in

446
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,799
2019

447
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,119
and we only expect this to get worse

448
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,240
with over 50 billion devices connected

449
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,480
in 2020

450
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,520
when it comes to home routers and

451
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
iot connected cameras or network

452
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,720
connected cameras they made up for 90 of

453
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
the malware infected devices in 2019.

454
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,400
having a process for how these devices

455
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,320
are allowed to get onto the network and

456
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,440
what access that they get is like having

457
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,679
a cheat code it's like having the

458
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
ability to say

459
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,240
i want these things to occur and only

460
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
these things to occur

461
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
just by implementing an overall process

462
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
because let's face it we have a new

463
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,440
generation of workers devices and

464
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,039
workloads all coming into our premises

465
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,799
and accessing our networks even remotely

466
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,559
so let's talk a little bit about smart

467
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
building central's base requirements

468
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,679
because they represented most customers

469
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
that i work with it was a relatively

470
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,720
simple or supposedly relatively simple

471
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,320
implementation

472
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
500 users three to four devices per user

473
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,320
think a pc a voice over ip phone a mob

474
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,280
mobile device a corporate tablet

475
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
and then we can factor in there printers

476
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,559
hvac devices etc

477
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,160
as

478
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,880
equaling out the average of user to user

479
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,320
who doesn't have one device or another

480
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
we knew that they would have iot and

481
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,960
industrial control systems and bacnet

482
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
translation devices to interact with

483
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,080
hvac with thermostats etc

484
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,400
we talked about the guest proximity but

485
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,200
they also wanted unparalleled analytics

486
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,120
how secure are we

487
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,760
how do we move away from security as an

488
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,720
investment and justify that investment

489
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
with statistics about what was blocked

490
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,640
how it was blocked where it was blocked

491
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
because we know that risk is going to be

492
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,760
inherent to iot and we want the ability

493
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,720
to

494
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
categorize and quantify what that risk

495
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,520
is

496
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,120
now we knew that we'd have a number of

497
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,440
challenges with smart building central

498
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
and then we had some unknown challenges

499
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,120
as well

500
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,919
the known challenge well ilt has a

501
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,600
lateral attack vector

502
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
what we didn't take into account is some

503
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
of those r those iot devices

504
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,160
were not necessarily rfc compliant

505
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,280
for example if we do 802.1x to

506
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,840
authenticate a device onto the network

507
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,200
even utilizing mac authentication bypass

508
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,160
there's the expectation that if a device

509
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,320
is queried for its credentials and

510
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,160
responds back with yes i have

511
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
credentials it will also send those

512
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
credentials

513
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,919
and what we found is with some of these

514
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,320
devices they would respond back with yes

515
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,120
i have credentials and then shut down

516
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,840
which caused the devices to remain

517
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,799
unauthorized and gave us little

518
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,120
visibility into what they were or how

519
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
they were interacting with the network

520
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
until we restarted them and started the

521
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
process all over again

522
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
in addition there are a number of

523
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
unattended media devices or digital

524
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,159
signage throughout the building

525
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,640
essentially just a microcomputer with a

526
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
presentation that was playing on it and

527
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,799
that microcomputer had to be network

528
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,840
connected and even though it was vrf'd

529
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,720
off and even though it was segmented we

530
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,640
wanted the ability to ensure that these

531
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,559
unattended media devices didn't become

532
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,960
jump off points and didn't disseminate

533
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,679
any proprietary information to smart

534
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
building central to the outside world or

535
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,320
to a nefarious actor

536
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,400
so the question came down to

537
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
how do we do it

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,200
and the basis behind that is if you knew

539
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
that you're going to be compromised

540
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,760
would you do security differently

541
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
every customer i've ever worked with

542
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
when asked this question the answer is

543
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,799
always the same

544
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,000
absolutely

545
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
but how do i get started

546
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
well let's talk about how you get

547
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,600
started

548
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,880
now being a cisco services engineer i do

549
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,280
want to make brief mention here of cisco

550
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,600
services in our approach

551
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,520
when we implemented smart building

552
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,919
central we came in with our three major

553
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,400
pillars of cisco services

554
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
we wanted the ability to plan out what

555
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
this would look like that included

556
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
program strategy understanding what the

557
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
overall goals were

558
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
doing the architecture and design and

559
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
then afterwards assessing what that

560
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,159
overall architecture and design resulted

561
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,880
in penetration tests security best

562
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
practice reviews etc

563
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
then we built this out with smart

564
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,159
building central doing the integration

565
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,120
into

566
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,400
the application systems into hvac into

567
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,760
the networking

568
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,280
overall environments

569
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,080
migrating off of older applications into

570
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,799
new applications or migrating policies

571
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,799
from old firewalls and segmentation

572
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,240
strategies into newer methodologies

573
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
and then optimizing ensuring that the

574
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
right versions of code best practices

575
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,600
were followed etc were all present

576
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,240
within smart building central

577
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,720
and then the key differentiator here is

578
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
cisco managed services

579
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,799
cisco managed services manages the

580
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,520
entirety of smart building central all

581
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
ads changes and deletes we are

582
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
responsible for and the customer

583
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,320
entrusts us to keep them safe through

584
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,799
managed security hosted security and

585
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,559
overall product support

586
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,000
they never have to call tac themselves

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
all they have to say is something isn't

588
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,799
working cisco men services manages the

589
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,280
entire portfolio for them

590
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
so let's talk about the practicals

591
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,480
let's start to layer on what this looks

592
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
like in the overall methodology

593
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,360
like lego blocks

594
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,240
let's build an architecture

595
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,159
as i said before zero trust has been

596
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
described in many different ways by many

597
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
different companies via many different

598
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,520
models

599
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
one of the most familiar models is the

600
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,440
google beyond corp implementation of

601
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,880
xero trust

602
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
the google implementation of xero trust

603
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,360
follows a lot of the same concepts that

604
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
we've been talking about here

605
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,679
securely identify the devices going back

606
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,520
to contextual identity

607
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,679
securely identify the user

608
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,520
remove trust from the network moving

609
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
towards more of a white list approach as

610
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,440
opposed to a blacklist approach

611
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
and then externalize apps and workflows

612
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
while implementing inventory based

613
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
access control

614
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
cisco describes this as workforce

615
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
workplace workload

616
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
what is in my building

617
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
are they

618
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,919
in my workplace what how did they

619
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,000
connect to the network and then how do i

620
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
ensure that they are only interacting

621
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,440
with the network the way that i expect

622
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,799
them to

623
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,159
as i mentioned at the top of the

624
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,240
presentation i'm currently working as

625
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
part of a team to develop a

626
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,960
patent-pending model for how xero trust

627
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
is implemented in these sorts of

628
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
scenarios

629
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
this is that overall model

630
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,600
we have an overlay that overlay is

631
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,320
understanding what my policies

632
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
motivations and challenges are going to

633
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,240
be from the onset

634
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
understanding how this device is going

635
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
to have to be overseen in the network

636
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,559
and what challenges we're going to have

637
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,880
around operational capabilities

638
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
administration capabilities and

639
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
troubleshooting capabilities what

640
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,520
policies do i have that either allow or

641
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,120
restrict the access that that device has

642
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,640
now i need to identify that device or

643
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,360
what i'm referring to as that entity and

644
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,400
that entity is a device with potentially

645
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,679
a user on it or possibly not iot devices

646
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,039
won't commonly have a device on them

647
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,840
can i assess this entity for risks it

648
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,159
poses to my network with vulnerability

649
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,080
management can i

650
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,200
determine what its baseline is what

651
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,520
ports it has open and if it has ports

652
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,840
that are open that shouldn't be or that

653
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
pose a

654
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,919
significant threat to my network think

655
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,600
unsecured ftp or smb version one how do

656
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,760
i prevent those from being exploited in

657
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,679
some way shape or form

658
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
and then enforcing that capability

659
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,919
can i allow or prevent that access with

660
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,679
the knowledge and the baseline that i

661
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,880
have

662
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,480
all of this continues to be analyzed at

663
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
every step to feed that information back

664
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,039
into overlay and again cyclically follow

665
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,520
through the overall process again

666
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,200
especially when it comes to purchasing

667
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,039
new devices or new devices that are

668
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,559
found on the network that we may not

669
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,520
expect them to be there

670
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,240
so let's talk about the security path

671
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,159
because there's no doubt in my mind

672
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,320
there's questions out there about so how

673
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
in the world do i do it

674
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,520
because hey patrick i'm not a one vendor

675
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,400
shop

676
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,480
and you don't have to be

677
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,960
what this comes down to is following the

678
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,559
same model with the products and

679
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,320
capabilities that you currently have

680
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,840
available to you

681
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,039
while cisco has an alignment to every

682
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,279
one of these capabilities with some sort

683
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,400
of product

684
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,559
it could also be done with other

685
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,400
products on the market

686
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,080
so when it comes to something like

687
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,640
determining identity and determining

688
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,440
that baseline evaluating based on that

689
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,400
visibility that we need into the network

690
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
well we need to establish that

691
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,000
visibility with a set of products to

692
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,919
form an overall visibility solution

693
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,919
when it comes to my workforce for

694
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,600
cisco's product alignment we're talking

695
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
about identity services engine we're

696
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,279
talking about utilizing radius to

697
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,320
authenticate authorize profile and do

698
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
posture evaluations of what that

699
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
endpoint looks like to the overall

700
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,200
network also integrating into things

701
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,159
like mobile device management platforms

702
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,000
we need the ability to understand what

703
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,320
our remote workplace visibility and

704
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
monitoring looks like as well

705
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,919
do we have the ability to identify a

706
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,000
device even if it's not on our network

707
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
even if it hasn't plugged into one of my

708
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,520
native switches

709
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,000
or into a wireless lan controller do i

710
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
have the ability to determine what that

711
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,760
device is based on how it's interacting

712
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,159
with the network and then once i

713
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,480
identify it do i have the ability to

714
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
gain visibility into how it's

715
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,799
interacting with my network overall with

716
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,200
things like network visibility as well

717
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,159
as

718
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,559
providing my managed devices with a

719
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,440
trusted network detection capability

720
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
i need to understand how it interacts

721
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,919
with the outside world through dns

722
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,240
monitoring for example so that i can

723
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,640
understand what the malware on the

724
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,600
network looks like where it came from

725
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,240
based on a device possibly

726
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,399
accessing a website that spun up just

727
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,440
mere moments ago and being somehow redir

728
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
redirected to that website through

729
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
cross-site scripting or overall phishing

730
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
attacks

731
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,159
as devices connect into my network while

732
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,799
in my workplace i want to understand how

733
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,720
those devices interact with one another

734
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,399
one of the best ways to do that is

735
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,640
through netflow netflow gives us the

736
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,559
ability to understand what is contained

737
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,360
within the headers within the flow ports

738
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
protocols etc

739
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
and then in my data center or in my

740
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,080
virtual workload i have the ability to

741
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,960
utilize tetration to understand how

742
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,200
these devices interact with a virtual

743
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
server that may not be possible with

744
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,799
some of the standard monitoring

745
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,559
techniques

746
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,880
because as i said we need that

747
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
contextual identity we need to

748
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,559
understand everything about this

749
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,120
endpoint and what threats it poses to my

750
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,240
network

751
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,159
the way that we used to do this was just

752
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,399
with an ip address or just with a mac

753
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,559
address that i p and that mac

754
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,200
combination don't mean much when macs

755
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,159
are very easily spoofed and ip addresses

756
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,360
go away after eight hours or whenever we

757
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
unplug the device and plug it in

758
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,279
somewhere differently if we have an

759
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,840
overall campus with thousands of devices

760
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,480
and a massive dhcp pool to enable their

761
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,440
access we can't necessarily write

762
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,760
control rules to prevent those devices

763
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,919
from interacting with the outside world

764
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,320
unless we get as close to the device as

765
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,960
our control capability allows us to do

766
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,159
so and therefore we need to understand

767
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
who is on that device where it's located

768
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,440
what that device is what access it's

769
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,840
being granted what medium it's coming in

770
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
over and what the threats and

771
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
vulnerabilities to our overall network

772
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,960
are so that we can apply that control as

773
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
close to the endpoint as possible

774
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,000
now by this point you're probably sick

775
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
of hearing me say identity visibility

776
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,279
identity disability

777
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,440
but at the same time

778
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,600
i think that also reinforces how

779
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,399
important identity and visibility is to

780
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,960
our overall network it truly is the

781
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,080
keystone of securing a smart or xero

782
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
trust based implementation

783
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,600
and we need to understand what access

784
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,760
should this user have but that comes

785
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,960
from knowing who the user is what role

786
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
does this user have and therefore what

787
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,880
access should we give it what is it

788
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,120
accessing where are they trying to go

789
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
who is on the machine currently

790
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,559
especially if it's a shared machine with

791
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,320
multiple accounts etc

792
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,559
the next step of this

793
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,760
is the ability to control based on that

794
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,880
identity

795
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,320
we need the ability to enforce and

796
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,039
ensure that we can prevent that device

797
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,520
from interacting with other areas of the

798
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,279
network that we don't want it

799
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,440
interacting with

800
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
we can do that with a number of

801
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
different products or different

802
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
capabilities we can do that with a

803
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,200
downloadable access list an automated

804
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
push of an access list based on what

805
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,880
that device looks like and what its

806
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,559
contextual identity

807
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,559
is on our network

808
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,960
when we determine that malware is out

809
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
there that malware protection

810
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,399
application can also prevent that device

811
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,919
from interacting with the rest of the

812
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,080
network until it determines that that

813
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,720
malware is no longer present

814
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,120
we can manage mobile devices in these

815
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,279
little boxes in our pockets

816
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,000
with some sort of mobile device manager

817
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,279
and then our

818
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,960
corporate machines with an endpoint

819
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,240
manager

820
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,799
we can also now detect what malware

821
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,120
exists within the network by scanning

822
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,760
all files that come through a firewall

823
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,000
or a centralized control point that's a

824
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,760
little bit further away from the access

825
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,919
layer so that we understand what our

826
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,240
overall vulnerability management

827
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,320
looks like out there and then prevent

828
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
certain traffic flows based on that as

829
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,679
well

830
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,919
we can control utilizing two-factor

831
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,279
authentication

832
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,279
we can control based on

833
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,000
dns lookup and we can also control

834
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,799
within the workload by utilizing a

835
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,360
virtual workload control capability with

836
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,440
ip tables and built-in firewall

837
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,440
capabilities

838
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
we then need to understand what our

839
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,399
vulnerabilities look like out there

840
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,320
and the control and vulnerability

841
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,360
management pieces could be interchanged

842
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,080
i cover control first to reinforce the

843
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
idea that just having the knowledge of

844
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,600
what identity is out there is fantastic

845
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,320
but until we have the ability to control

846
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
and understand what vulnerabilities an

847
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,200
endpoint poses to our overall network

848
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
we're going to be left behind and

849
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
prevented from implementing the overall

850
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
zero trust solution

851
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,200
so the ability to do vulnerability

852
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
management with a posture and compliance

853
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
module for example utilizing our

854
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
intrusion prevention systems utilizing

855
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
malware detection systems

856
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,320
encrypting

857
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,960
the transport between devices whether

858
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,360
that's layer 2 encryption between

859
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,799
two devices that exist between

860
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,039
two switches and those switches have

861
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,559
some sort of direct connection to one

862
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,840
another or over the lan or over a

863
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,559
private mpls for example

864
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,640
and then same thing for virtual

865
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,440
workloads utilizing ip tables built-in

866
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,640
firewall capabilities to understand

867
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,799
what they are currently seeing in terms

868
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,200
of open ports and whether those ports

869
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
cause some sort of

870
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,080
vulnerability to possibly be exploited

871
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,799
within our overall network

872
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,120
finally we're analyzing

873
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,159
we're utilizing our sim we're using

874
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,720
profiling information about what devices

875
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,640
are out there how they're configured

876
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,960
what the best practices are

877
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,919
etc and then utilizing that information

878
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,880
to feed into our identification or

879
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,679
radius engine feeding that into

880
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,720
our

881
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,360
firewall and then logging all of that

882
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,399
back to the sim and understanding how

883
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,918
devices are interacting out on the

884
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,560
network and what their behaviors are

885
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,800
and this allows for us to do automated

886
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,199
provisioning and overall automated

887
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,399
detection and response

888
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,800
for smart building central we followed

889
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
this very model

890
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,918
we had our overlay on the underside of

891
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,918
understanding what our motivations and

892
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,239
challenges were going to be

893
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,320
and next we'll talk a little bit about

894
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,119
policy and how policy interacted with

895
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,119
smart building central

896
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,199
but they utilized identity services

897
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,960
engine for workforce profiling and

898
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,280
visibility they utilized umbrella for

899
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
dns monitoring

900
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,599
stealthwatch they enforced with ice

901
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,040
downloadable access lists trustsec etc

902
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
they had advanced malware protection at

903
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,359
the network layer to understand files as

904
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,000
they traversed over a given firewall and

905
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,720
then prevented the categories of urls

906
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
that weren't business relevant adult

907
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,800
themes etc

908
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,280
utilizing intrusion prevention and that

909
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,760
advanced malware protection we ensured

910
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,640
that

911
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,119
as files came into the network or as

912
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,599
behavioral analytics indicated that

913
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,440
there might be a threat on the network

914
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,240
either from a file or from a given user

915
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,160
those could be blocked and then we

916
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,720
encrypted all transport point to point

917
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,118
whenever possible

918
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,040
now

919
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,880
typically the biggest feedback that i

920
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
get from customers whenever i have this

921
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
conversation at this point is

922
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,800
you're talking about a lot of products

923
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,640
you're talking a lot about a lot of

924
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,359
capabilities that we can't necessarily

925
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,480
implement all of tomorrow it's just not

926
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,800
feasible both from a budgetary as well

927
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,960
as an overall manpower

928
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,240
need to make this a success

929
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,880
we can't change our entire approach to

930
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,200
networking to integrate with your model

931
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
and you don't have to

932
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,440
what this comes down to is it lays out a

933
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,520
model that you can utilize bits and

934
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,839
pieces of as you're ready as your

935
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,480
organization can take them on and as you

936
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
have the ability to administer log and

937
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,400
overall operate and troubleshoot these

938
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,200
capabilities within the network

939
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,359
so the key is to layer security

940
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,119
throughout the architecture

941
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,040
while the overall security onion for

942
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,280
smart building central was vast this

943
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
isn't going to be the bulk of many

944
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
customers at least not right now

945
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,720
but distributing static policy onto

946
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,240
firewalls policy that doesn't

947
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,480
necessarily change

948
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,880
and dynamic policy with downloadable

949
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,160
acls policy that can actively be changed

950
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,480
based on what we see as the endpoint's

951
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,800
contextual identity and its overall

952
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
vulnerabilities

953
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,960
that gives us the capability to layer in

954
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,520
additional security in a piecemeal

955
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
fashion

956
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
we then exchange that contextual

957
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,040
identity across all mechanisms that have

958
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,599
the ability to consume that identity

959
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,839
into our stealthwatch records into our

960
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,079
sorry netflow records into our firewall

961
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,079
records into

962
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,800
our overall dns resolution to be able to

963
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,480
say this user on this device went here

964
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,880
and they tried to perform this action

965
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,960
which led to an overall threat to the

966
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,920
network and therefore we responded to it

967
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,800
based on an established policy that said

968
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,280
we need to quarantine devices that take

969
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,079
this sort of action

970
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,839
so step number one

971
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,680
gain visibility

972
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,920
the design principles will hold

973
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,160
regardless of the controls and

974
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,079
vulnerability management that we're

975
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,359
applying here

976
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,880
we still want to understand what's on

977
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,560
the network but we're still going to

978
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,359
logically segment them with vlans and

979
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,560
vrfs

980
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,000
the nice thing about dynamic

981
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,079
capabilities within radius is we have

982
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,280
the ability to say that a vlan can be

983
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,920
dynamically allocated to a port based on

984
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,839
its identity as well

985
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,880
we overlay radius dns and net flow on

986
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,160
top of this and we log log

987
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,280
log

988
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,599
by logging this it gives us more

989
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,760
information to filter down

990
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,680
the challenge is we need a good

991
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,160
correlation engine that says these

992
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
things happen based on these identities

993
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,599
and these overall processes so we need

994
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,400
to continue continually go back review

995
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,560
the logs and have that influence our

996
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,720
overall policy

997
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,520
so

998
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,119
what was the journey that we went down

999
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,280
with smart building central to do

1000
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
exactly this

1001
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,480
well we started with lab-based

1002
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,760
vulnerability

1003
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,599
we knew that we would have a handful of

1004
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,920
devices regardless of whether this was a

1005
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,720
greenfield or a brownfield building

1006
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,920
that

1007
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,599
we knew would have to be present within

1008
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,640
the building

1009
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,800
corporate pcs aren't going to change

1010
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,839
just because a new building opens up

1011
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,599
phones are not necessarily going to

1012
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,680
change in their overall behavior even

1013
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,520
though the model may change when the

1014
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,960
building opens up

1015
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,839
same thing for physical iq cameras badge

1016
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,800
readers

1017
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,680
etc that all give us the capability to

1018
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,000
identify at least what the baseline

1019
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
understanding of a device from the same

1020
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,560
vendor looks like and be able to

1021
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,440
identify it to work into the contextual

1022
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,079
identity conundrum

1023
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,079
we then went into monitor mode

1024
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,480
collecting as much data as possible on

1025
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,520
how these devices operate how they look

1026
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
and how we could interact with them to

1027
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,839
ensure that we could identify them as

1028
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,520
clearly as possible

1029
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,599
because that identity would then be

1030
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,320
shared throughout the entire

1031
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,040
ecosystem to ensure that as these

1032
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,200
devices interacted internally and

1033
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,440
externally we understood what that

1034
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,359
traffic looked like

1035
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,200
the question came down to

1036
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,839
now how do we process that visibility

1037
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,359
what are these endpoints interacting

1038
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,839
with how are they interacting because

1039
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,240
that would help us formulate a plan

1040
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
utilizing the lab first starting in

1041
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,920
non-production giving us the ability to

1042
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,880
gather that information create a policy

1043
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,440
minimize vulnerabilities and enforce

1044
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,280
that as much as possible

1045
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,960
wash rinse repeat

1046
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,040
so the most common mistakes that i see

1047
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,680
customers go about with something like

1048
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,560
this well honestly are numerous

1049
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,599
so the first one is i have had a number

1050
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,760
of customers tell me before we know how

1051
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,440
all of our systems interact it's

1052
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,880
relatively simple

1053
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
we know that they interact on these

1054
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,200
ports with these external systems with

1055
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,560
these capabilities and that's it

1056
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,640
but when we start to do the contextual

1057
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,960
identity identification

1058
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
we now build in traffic gathering and

1059
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,079
understanding what that traffic looks

1060
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,800
like out on the network and when it

1061
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,119
comes to just the 500 endpoints that we

1062
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,440
have or 500 users with 3 to 4 endpoints

1063
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,880
so 1500 endpoints within smart building

1064
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,079
central

1065
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,480
we came up with

1066
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,480
145 different classifications of devices

1067
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,319
now each of these cells that you see

1068
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,720
within this spreadsheet is a set of

1069
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,400
ports and protocols for each one of

1070
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,240
those 145

1071
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,480
different types of devices which means

1072
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,040
that any one device could be at

1073
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,760
interacting with only one other device

1074
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,040
or could be interacting with 10 20 even

1075
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,839
100 separate devices as you can see with

1076
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,560
the green cells there

1077
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,400
now the challenge that you run into is

1078
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,920
now it's almost like information

1079
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,720
overload i know so much about my network

1080
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,880
and i need to classify and i need to

1081
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,480
analyze it as much as we possibly could

1082
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
so now

1083
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,720
i need more than five to seven groupings

1084
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,800
now let's take a step back and let's

1085
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,680
talk about groupings for a minute

1086
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,800
groupings

1087
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,440
are essentially the way that we used to

1088
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,720
classify endpoints into vlans

1089
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,560
we used to say i'm going to put these

1090
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,400
devices on a voice vlan i'm going to put

1091
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,240
these devices on a data vlan these

1092
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,880
devices on a guest vlan et cetera

1093
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
but eventually we started to say you

1094
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,119
know what in the data vlan i may have

1095
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,680
corporate devices that are pcs i may

1096
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,560
have corporate managed mobile devices

1097
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,359
i may have voice devices that are also

1098
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,280
video enabled and others that aren't

1099
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,800
video enabled

1100
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,720
and what it comes down to is we want to

1101
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,319
broadly classify as i said five to seven

1102
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,359
groups

1103
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,760
so that we can then within those broad

1104
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,599
classifications break that down into

1105
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,880
more detailed classifications and better

1106
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,839
be able to apply policy that is both

1107
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,000
common to the broad as well as more

1108
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,960
specific to the the smaller without

1109
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
boiling the ocean

1110
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,640
because the best way that we can go

1111
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,760
about this with cisco technologies is

1112
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,319
utilizing security group tags

1113
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,880
a security group tag is the ability to

1114
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,000
at layer 2 similar to the vlan header

1115
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
utilize the unused 16 bits within the

1116
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,800
frame to apply an identifier and write

1117
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,880
policies based on that identifier which

1118
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,040
is the entire concept behind cisco

1119
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,640
trussec

1120
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,440
so

1121
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,760
when it comes down to analyzing what

1122
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,400
those 145 devices

1123
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,240
looked like and how they interacted with

1124
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,319
every other one we knew it was going to

1125
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,880
be information overload what it came

1126
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,599
down to is for one 24-hour period we

1127
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,160
were talking about almost 90 000 flows

1128
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,200
between these devices

1129
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,319
with that in mind 2.6 million flows over

1130
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,480
the course of 30 days

1131
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
how is an operations engineer going to

1132
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,960
differentiate between an itpc and a

1133
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,040
finance pc if we apply different

1134
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,599
distinct policies to each of them and

1135
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,599
put them in their own unique group

1136
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,240
scaling up to that 145 by 145

1137
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,079
it starts to kind of look like a whole

1138
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,160
bunch of ones and zeros

1139
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,359
if we don't simplify and then educate

1140
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,240
while also expanding down into something

1141
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,760
more discrete

1142
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,920
the other big mistake that we

1143
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,040
get a lot of times is

1144
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,359
our customers tell us hey we know all

1145
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,160
the devices we know all the users and we

1146
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,880
know that they're all within policy

1147
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,520
and my next question to that is do your

1148
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,119
users know that

1149
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,119
do your users understand what your

1150
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,040
overall policy is

1151
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,200
because to be honest corporate endpoint

1152
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,319
managers

1153
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,040
give a false sense of security

1154
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,880
it gives us the ability to say hey i

1155
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
have all these devices out there but

1156
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,280
what about that cell phone that's on

1157
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,960
your guest internet

1158
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,440
logged in with a username and password

1159
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,200
from a corporate user

1160
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
how is that interacting with your

1161
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,240
network

1162
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,319
how do we know that someone didn't bring

1163
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,720
their own pc and with a little bit of

1164
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
google searching configure their own

1165
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,880
supplicant to be able to use peep with a

1166
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,640
username and password

1167
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,319
just with their own

1168
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,440
machine that is completely against uh

1169
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,520
corporate policy

1170
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,920
what about smart devices if that smart

1171
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,640
device couldn't actively identify itself

1172
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,800
do we know that it's on the network

1173
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,720
have we done any analysis for what may

1174
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,319
be connected to the network on an

1175
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,960
overall connectivity favored network as

1176
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,920
opposed to a security favored network

1177
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
the question comes down to what is

1178
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,480
really connected and where

1179
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,800
and then just because a device is up to

1180
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,040
date does not necessarily mean that's

1181
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
behaving as expected

1182
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,599
going back to the camera use case

1183
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,880
just because the device is behaving as

1184
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,440
is up to date doesn't necessarily mean

1185
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
that i can't pull up the camera feed and

1186
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,000
see it from any pc on the network with

1187
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,920
the default credentials

1188
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,800
the firmware may be up to date but if

1189
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,160
the credentials are admin admin

1190
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,760
anybody's going to be able to log into

1191
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,599
that again with a very simple google

1192
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,359
search

1193
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,400
now

1194
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,160
that leads into one of the additional

1195
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,079
challenges that we run into

1196
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:10,880
is

1197
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,079
we have

1198
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,400
a lot of customers who say anyone can

1199
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,480
purchase a device and add it to the

1200
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,720
network at any time

1201
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,599
well

1202
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,800
this really yields the need for a

1203
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,599
onboarding policy a consistent policy

1204
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,480
that can be applied across all endpoints

1205
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,400
and ensure that we understand what the

1206
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,800
device looks like what access it's going

1207
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,520
to get based on its contextual identity

1208
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,160
that who what where when how and its

1209
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,319
overall threat network

1210
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,599
so threat to the network so now when

1211
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,760
we need that consistent onboarding

1212
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,680
process we need to develop something

1213
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,160
that gives us the ability to identify

1214
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,680
and therefore based on that

1215
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,240
identification what capabilities do we

1216
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,200
have to control it based on both the

1217
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,119
identity as well as the vulnerability

1218
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,599
management what information did we get

1219
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,119
and how do we prevent this device from

1220
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,200
being exploited or having an overall

1221
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,079
larger blast zone or

1222
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,400
impact to the network if a nefarious

1223
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
actor has introduced it into the overall

1224
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
network

1225
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,800
and then hey we can't do this on the

1226
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,520
timelines that we have

1227
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,880
this is again a massive endeavor that

1228
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,680
you patrick are saying to us we can do

1229
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,319
but we have really quick

1230
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,559
uh projects that we're trying to knock

1231
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,880
out on a regular basis we're

1232
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,960
understaffed those staffed are

1233
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,319
overworked

1234
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,640
but we still want to take the first

1235
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,880
steps on a zero trust journey

1236
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,680
so every journey has its first steps

1237
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,040
let's talk about how you can get started

1238
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,359
again we go back to what we were talking

1239
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,599
about before the croc crawl walk run

1240
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,520
need for introducing additional

1241
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,839
capabilities onto the network in other

1242
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,480
words don't expand behind beyond your

1243
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,319
operational abilities

1244
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,240
you're looking to gain visibility for

1245
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,440
example

1246
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,160
understand what those devices are

1247
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,400
with radius with some sort of network

1248
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,119
access control solution that isn't

1249
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,119
implemented in any sort of enforcement

1250
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,119
enforcement mode

1251
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,760
understand those devices on your network

1252
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,280
once you understand those devices on

1253
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,400
your network as the next budgetary cycle

1254
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,640
comes around or as the next free period

1255
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,480
comes around now understand how those

1256
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,200
devices interact with one another it may

1257
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,119
extend out your journey but at least

1258
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,760
your journey is moving forward remember

1259
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,640
it's a journey not a destination

1260
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,559
and then add layers to the overall

1261
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,760
basics

1262
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,200
if you already use

1263
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,079
vlans but you don't use vrf's try

1264
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,480
breaking those vlans into

1265
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,040
segmented areas that are all prevented

1266
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,280
from accessing other vlans that they may

1267
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,160
need may not need access to unless they

1268
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,440
go through a firewall an east-west type

1269
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,760
lateral firewall with policies that

1270
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,760
dictate what that looks like as opposed

1271
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,240
to routing your vlans everywhere

1272
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,160
same thing if you're

1273
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,640
commonly interacting with the outside

1274
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,119
world well understand what that outside

1275
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,119
world interaction looks like with dns

1276
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,680
monitoring and then prevent some of

1277
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,520
those categorical

1278
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,520
uh needs from being prevented from being

1279
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
accessing the outside world and those

1280
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,839
resources that aren't necessarily needed

1281
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,880
when we talk about implementing this

1282
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,640
we're typically talking about phases of

1283
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,240
implementation i've been kind of

1284
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,359
referring to that throughout the

1285
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,960
presentation here

1286
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,880
start in some sort of open mode of

1287
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,839
visibility mode understand what those

1288
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,559
devices are doing on the overall network

1289
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,680
first

1290
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,559
then do some sort of enforcement between

1291
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,480
your vrfs as i talked about with a

1292
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,880
firewall you can prevent vrfs that

1293
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,960
contain vlans that have no need to

1294
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,119
interact with one another

1295
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,359
but still allow for exceptions to the

1296
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,599
rule a white list approach

1297
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,640
by applying policies via the firewall

1298
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,520
and then start within your overall vrfs

1299
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,119
as well

1300
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,559
eventually this will move down to the

1301
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,280
vlan level and it's working

1302
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,760
towards the individual endpoint and

1303
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,599
controlling that individual endpoint

1304
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,040
based on the information that we're

1305
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,119
gathering about it

1306
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,880
now the one nice thing that i've already

1307
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,839
kind of mentioned here is utilizing a

1308
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,520
radius solution

1309
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,119
like ice to apply vlans dynamically

1310
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,280
validate that this endpoint is on the

1311
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,079
right vlan for the operations that it

1312
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,680
should be performing

1313
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,640
you could also use downloadable acls a

1314
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,720
dynamic ability to prevent that device

1315
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,319
from interacting with areas of the

1316
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,240
network that it shouldn't be based on

1317
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,520
its identity

1318
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,160
and then move towards a layer 2

1319
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,800
segmentation ability with security group

1320
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,000
tags

1321
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,240
for those who have tried to

1322
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,800
administer private vlans or mac based

1323
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,920
acls we can tell you it is an absolute

1324
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,559
nightmare to try to implement that

1325
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,559
so instead move towards a dynamic

1326
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,880
capability where you can modify the

1327
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,760
packet header and prevent access without

1328
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,280
having to actively change your acl or

1329
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,480
add in thousands more vlans

1330
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,160
just to control those endpoints and how

1331
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,879
they interact

1332
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,079
essentially automation is going to be

1333
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,680
that ultimate goal

1334
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,640
prevent your users from taking

1335
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,760
manual actions to free them up to work

1336
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,640
on

1337
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,920
other policies other

1338
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,040
operational pieces of the network

1339
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,119
give us the ability to dynamically

1340
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,319
provision

1341
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,720
and utilize machine language machine

1342
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,839
learning to influence policy

1343
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,760
and then we can quarantine on action

1344
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,240
where we do need to manually influence

1345
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,760
how an endpoint interacts with the

1346
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,119
network

1347
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,680
so the question at this point is well

1348
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,720
is

1349
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,119
smart building central still out there

1350
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,319
absolutely

1351
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,559
they're continuing on their zero trust

1352
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,680
journey

1353
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,440
one of the pieces that they found has

1354
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,359
been the most challenging for them is

1355
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,599
that onboarding consistency

1356
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,359
the onboarding consistency that we

1357
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,440
implemented is any new device that's

1358
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,520
never been seen on the network before

1359
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,079
automatically gets quarantined into a

1360
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,319
vlan that has very little access

1361
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,839
whatsoever

1362
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,599
therefore they have to take it to some

1363
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,280
sort of genius bar or some sort of help

1364
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,400
desk or lab based area to introduce that

1365
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,119
device onto the network gain visibility

1366
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,599
into what it's attempting to do and then

1367
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,319
operationally authenticate authorize and

1368
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,559
profile that device

1369
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,880
their procedure and policy is also

1370
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,520
constantly evolving as new endpoints

1371
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,040
come onto the network as they're

1372
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,040
purchased for the network we need the

1373
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,400
ability to onboard consistently but also

1374
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,119
be able to identify what those devices

1375
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:03,920
are

1376
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,640
before we statically classify them and

1377
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,240
work around the implementation

1378
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,960
techniques that we've used to prevent

1379
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,680
that

1380
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,359
overall vulnerability being on our

1381
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,480
network

1382
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,359
and then log analysis and automation

1383
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,200
smart building central has a ton of

1384
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,880
tools to crunch all of that noise into

1385
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,480
signal and say

1386
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,760
here's what you need to be most

1387
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,920
concerned about and here's how we

1388
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,040
identify or address what those

1389
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,359
identities are and what access they

1390
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,599
should be provided

1391
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,480
now

1392
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,280
as one of the final mistake final

1393
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,520
greatest mistakes here i have a ton of

1394
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,280
customers who said to me listen my

1395
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,240
endpoint is never going to work with me

1396
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,559
to change endpoint policy to push the

1397
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,640
supplicant to give me the ability to

1398
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,440
authenticate endpoints onto the network

1399
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,480
and we don't necessarily need to it's

1400
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,720
ideal but there are workarounds

1401
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,280
available as well all we need is

1402
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,440
identity services engine and an active

1403
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,200
directory machine account

1404
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,920
it's what we refer to as easy connect

1405
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,160
it's the ability to integrate our

1406
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,280
identity and access solution with an

1407
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,559
integration into active directory to say

1408
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,880
hey i just found this device that came

1409
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,839
onto the network without 802.1x but we

1410
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,359
know that it had to do dhcp dns and

1411
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,680
login via active directory

1412
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,920
if we have those credentials that had to

1413
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,960
authenticate against active directory we

1414
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,440
there's also a log in active directory

1415
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,520
possibly on your domain controller that

1416
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,359
this user logged in

1417
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,720
so now we utilize our identity and

1418
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,960
identity implementation to query active

1419
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,440
directory to say i have this device that

1420
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,520
just logged in you have anything that

1421
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,000
looks like this possibly has this mac

1422
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,480
address and logged in at this given time

1423
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,280
stamp and by doing so we can now

1424
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,640
identify that hey that was the user and

1425
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,720
changed their access to provide them

1426
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,280
more dynamic access even without

1427
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,799
interacting

1428
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,200
with endpoint teams that may also be

1429
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,760
very much overloaded

1430
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,799
and then

1431
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,200
hey my workforce has shifted to mostly

1432
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,160
remote

1433
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,079
let's face it i'm remote in north

1434
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,960
carolina right now even for those of you

1435
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
on site in texas

1436
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,680
how can i apply this to my remote medium

1437
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,720
well your remote medium needs all the

1438
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,040
same things that your physical mediums

1439
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,440
are going to require as well you still

1440
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,160
need that flow visibility

1441
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,400
with that flow visibility you can

1442
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
utilize that to better modify your

1443
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,240
policies and give you more information

1444
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,839
on what you can offload to local

1445
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,079
internet as opposed to sending over your

1446
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,280
wan to a centralized data center that

1447
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,400
may be consuming more throughput on your

1448
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,240
interconnection links

1449
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,720
we can do dynamic authorization even

1450
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,599
over the vpn medium and then we can gain

1451
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,400
visibility for remote access

1452
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,640
with the same outcome we can still

1453
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,720
understand what the network traversal

1454
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,280
once that device has remotely connected

1455
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,160
to a vpn termination device

1456
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,400
that it's doing we can understand what

1457
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,119
the dns lookups look like what any file

1458
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,760
trajectory as it migrates throughout the

1459
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,640
network look like and it gives us more

1460
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,359
oversight into compliance

1461
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,559
so

1462
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,960
to really briefly wrap up let me bring

1463
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960
you back to the three points that i've

1464
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,160
mentioned at the beginning of the

1465
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,599
presentation

1466
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,760
first off most of our customers been

1467
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,240
working towards zero trust for years

1468
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,799
i think i illustrated this with a bit of

1469
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,400
conversation around your vlans your vrfs

1470
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,920
your firewall policy now you can overlay

1471
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,160
identity utilizing radius utilizing dns

1472
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,319
utilizing netflow

1473
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,119
zero trust is an evolving process that

1474
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,079
onboarding process is going to be a

1475
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,760
massive change for

1476
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,720
many companies who have been focusing on

1477
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
just get the connectivity don't

1478
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,359
necessarily worry about security

1479
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,839
that change alone can make a massive

1480
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,799
difference in what capabilities a user

1481
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,200
has when they get on the network and

1482
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,440
what ability you have to identify those

1483
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,040
users and what devices that they're

1484
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,880
currently on

1485
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,000
and bottom line start with visibility

1486
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,720
understand identity understand the

1487
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,480
interaction outside the network

1488
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,400
understand the interaction inside of the

1489
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,160
network develop a policy based on that

1490
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
enforce that policy based on the

1491
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,240
potential vulnerabilities that are

1492
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,480
pertinent to the network

1493
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,440
again i'd like to thank you for

1494
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,680
attending this presentation i'll be in

1495
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,760
the discord during the presentation here

1496
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,359
to answer any questions that you might

1497
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,000
have and again if you have any questions

1498
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,119
