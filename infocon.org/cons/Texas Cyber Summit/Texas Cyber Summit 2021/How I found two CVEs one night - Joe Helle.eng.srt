00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,000
hello everyone my name is joe helly

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,520
senior penetration tester at tcm

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,600
security solutions and here today we're

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,359
going to talk about how i was bored one

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,840
night and found two cves and how we can

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,519
leverage this the hack to hiring process

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,480
by pen testing green open source

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
applications

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,080
so who am i i'm an army iraq and

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,480
afghanistan war veteran i'm also known

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,880
online as the mayor and why because i

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,199
was an elected mayor i hold three

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,760
individual cves as you can see there and

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,599
also have two cves that i earned with

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,000
another person i hold multiple

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,079
penetration testing and

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
i t certifications the ecppt the ewpt

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,079
the pnpt oscp etc

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,920
i'm a huge advocate for changing the

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,840
entry processes into cyber security

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,039
careers

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
and my first professional job in it was

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
actually as a penetration tester i'm the

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,879
creator of the popular movement pivoting

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,399
and persistence course and i'm a former

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,120
moonshiner

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
we're here today because hiring and

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,559
offensive security cyber security

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
positions is broken right you need

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,920
experience to get the job but you need a

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
job to get the experience

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,560
bug bounty hunting has become saturated

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
and as more and more people try to break

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
in the certificate value diminishes for

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,640
people as more people obtain the same

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
credentials it's you know basic

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,640
economics

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,479
and supply and demand

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,080
candidates struggle to set themselves

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,479
apart from their peers because of this

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,240
and unfortunately with as many

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,600
certification companies and

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,960
organizations as there are few

44
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,799
organizations speak the same language

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,360
when it comes to quantifiable experience

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
but in security one thing does stand out

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,720
among

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,520
most

49
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
cyber security realms and that is cbes

50
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,799
what is a cve a cve is abbreviated for

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,200
common vulnerabilities and exposures

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,840
it's maintained by mitre the cv database

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,079
is repository of publicly disclosed

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,520
vulnerabilities

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
a publicly disclosed cve through mitre

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
is a first time disclosure of a zero day

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
vulnerability finding

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
many professionals in the field will go

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,479
through their entire careers without

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
finding one others may find several over

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,280
the same amount of time

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
some cbe findings affect security on a

63
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
global scale we're talking about things

64
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,599
like zero logon solarwinds etc other

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,440
findings might affect small applications

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
created and maintained by small brick

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,879
and mortar companies and are free and

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,160
open source

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,000
my first cbe for instance came in my

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,160
first month as a pen tester on a client

71
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
web application pen test

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
size doesn't really matter when it comes

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
to cvs either so it doesn't matter if

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,319
it's a simple reflect collected

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
cross-site scripting or

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,560
again something as large as solar winds

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
a cve is a cve

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
and being able to find a zero-day

79
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
vulnerability that is reported to mitre

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
shows your initiative your ability to

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,319
research

82
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,560
the ability to create proofs of concept

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
write technically and manage client

84
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,319
communications

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
why are we doing this and why are we

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
talking about here today as the title

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,280
suggested this was born from a boring

88
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,519
sunday night that i was having i spend a

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,440
lot of time mentoring people struggling

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
to find work in the field and helping

91
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,480
them try to break in the same way i did

92
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,159
this means that i struggle as well since

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,239
the hiring process is really a huge

94
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,680
challenge

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
so leveraging my boredom and knowledge

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,440
on a sunday night i decided to test my

97
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
theory that earning a cv will help

98
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,799
people find gainful employment

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,239
so

100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,599
in order to

101
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
find a cve we really need to find

102
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
potential exploitable targets and this

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
can be easier said than done

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
considering application scale i didn't

105
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
want to take on a project that was going

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,959
to take months

107
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,760
of research and

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,159
you know scraping you know

109
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,720
windows applications and

110
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
etc to see if i could find one i just

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
wanted to quickly see how fast i could

112
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,159
find

113
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,720
a cve to be able to help other people so

114
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
i looked at free and open source

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
projects that were likely to not have

116
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,439
much security support right

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,280
larger more you know widely used

118
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
projects like wordpress are tested

119
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,480
constantly

120
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,159
smaller less used but maintained

121
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,680
projects likely were not that was kind

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,920
of my mindset going into this so this

123
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
served the dual purpose of not only

124
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,200
increasing our chances of finding the

125
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
zero day but also the opportunity to

126
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,879
help a smaller organization secure their

127
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,519
application

128
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
so i went to town

129
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
just thinking of things that i could

130
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
search for in google and using a bit of

131
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
google foo i thought of

132
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
you know big ticket industries that

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
uh oftentimes do their own in-house work

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,080
and i started targeting those industries

135
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
specifically things such as hospitals

136
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
schools hotels etc proved to be

137
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,039
successful

138
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,560
so i searched for hotel cms foss

139
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
and it's the search landed multiple

140
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
results the next challenge was going

141
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,560
through those applications that really

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
were free and open source and not

143
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
paywall applications hiding behind

144
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
marketing walls one in your email

145
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
wanting to

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
market their product to you etc

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
websites that proved

148
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
results of value or provided results of

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,000
value were sourceforge and github and

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,520
then the final challenge in which

151
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
applications the target

152
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
was really was i able to install them

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,280
so not having systems administrator

154
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
uh

155
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
experience not really you know working a

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
help desk before anything like that

157
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
uh not being a web developer

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
not being a database administrator some

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,199
of these things were challenging for me

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,360
so i finally chose the application hotel

161
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
druid it was straightforward it was an

162
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,479
easy install

163
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,320
and kudos to the developer for that

164
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
so a quick note downloadable

165
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
applications are generally safe to test

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,759
meaning you likely do not need

167
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
permission to do so on your own machine

168
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
some applications may have licensing

169
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
agreements that provide for criminal or

170
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,600
civil liabilities if testing is

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
conducted so ensure you read any of the

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
fine print available

173
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
boss applications generally will not

174
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
have those stipulations because they're

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,359
using

176
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
open source licensing

177
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
and even if you are in the clear know

178
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
that not all developers will be excited

179
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
that somebody tested and explored their

180
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
application so you might have to use a

181
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
little bit of verbal or email judo when

182
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
you're talking to these folks

183
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,440
and use your best judgment so back to

184
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
our talk now

185
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
so the exploitation itself is probably

186
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
the easiest part of the entire process

187
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,520
good testing methodology matters here

188
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,479
and using tools also works well so burp

189
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,800
suite pro oasis app

190
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,319
help really well

191
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,160
as the time was of the essence i use

192
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
burp suite pro because i have it you

193
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
could also use osap which is a free

194
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
product which is incredible

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
however these tools are really not

196
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
necessary it's just going to help you

197
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
with time management and project

198
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
management a bit

199
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,360
the vulnerabilities that i found in the

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
short exploitation window i had could

201
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,680
have been found with basic inputs

202
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,199
so in less than an hour i had already

203
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
found reflected cross-site scripting and

204
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
sql injection vulnerabilities

205
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
so sql injection allowed for full access

206
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,360
to the sqlite database which allowed

207
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
takeover of the data right so here we

208
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
see

209
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
the web application itself which i was

210
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
hosting on ubuntu machine

211
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,840
and you can see at the end i simply

212
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,240
add a semicolon here which you can use

213
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
to try to break

214
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
application logic

215
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
and

216
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,599
here now you see that i've generated a

217
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
reflected cross-site scripting payload

218
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,680
which got that payload to jump up and

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
here we can see arbitrary cross-site

220
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
scripting parameter injection and all i

221
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
did here was a simple

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
i broke the logic using a double quote

223
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,759
and closing bracket and then the

224
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,440
javascript payload itself

225
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
the sql injection once i determined that

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,800
i had sql injection i used sql map which

227
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,879
is a very common tool as well

228
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
and really just kind of makes some of

229
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
these things easy you could do this

230
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,680
manually you can see here the payload

231
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
itself for the

232
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
the union query it's union all select

233
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
and you can just insert no no no null

234
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,039
and then

235
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,960
the parameter values you want until you

236
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,800
get

237
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
the output that you're looking for again

238
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
because this was sql light light the

239
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
payloads are a bit different than

240
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,919
something like mysql etc so

241
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,280
here you can see in this case i was

242
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
running the php server

243
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,360
the backend database with sqlite and you

244
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,319
can see the version there

245
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,759
in total i found nearly 50 reflected

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,599
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

247
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,039
because all these pages were developed

248
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,240
the same way

249
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
and multiple input parameters were also

250
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
vulnerable to sqlite and the total time

251
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,240
of testing was less than two hours so

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
literally from

253
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,039
installation of the application and

254
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,360
ensuring that it's working until i found

255
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
the vulnerabilities themselves

256
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
and decided to wrap things up two hours

257
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,880
i think i did from like 8 p.m on a

258
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,040
sunday till 10 p.m that same sunday

259
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
so the application process itself can be

260
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
quite daunting when we're applying for a

261
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
cve and it's because there's not a lot

262
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,519
of documentation

263
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,880
available for this process

264
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
the first step in the process is

265
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
determine if the developer is a

266
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,800
certified number in authority or a cna

267
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,040
if the developer is a cna the cv

268
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
application process must process through

269
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
the developer themselves

270
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,959
if they're not a cna you can go through

271
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,000
mitre

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
and we will be covering the process of

273
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
going through miter here the process

274
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
will be changing in the future you'll be

275
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,519
using a cna of last resort at some point

276
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
which will be

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
a third party that will be processing

278
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
these for them but that's not the

279
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
current process and you should be good

280
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,360
for the next year doing it this way if

281
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
you choose to do this

282
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
after determining that the developer is

283
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,000
or is not a cna which you can do on

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,440
miter's website there will be a cve or a

285
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,680
cna link that you can click on and then

286
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
you just go through

287
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,360
i think there's about 200 of them

288
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
and you just search to see if the

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
developer is a cna and if not

290
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,959
then you're in the clear otherwise again

291
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,320
you have to go through them and then

292
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,240
it's a best practice to contact the

293
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,640
developer about the vulnerability we do

294
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
this out of respect to the developer

295
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
but to also give them an opportunity to

296
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
remedy the vulnerability before we make

297
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
it public right

298
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,959
so if it's a lesser used application

299
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,680
it might not have a whole lot of

300
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,839
ramifications right if

301
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,279
you release it

302
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
without talking to them but if you did

303
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
something

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
and you release the vulnerability and

305
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
say ios or

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,279
windows

307
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,079
without going through the cv process it

308
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,440
could really really affect

309
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,399
infrastructure so in this case

310
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,839
you know both of those companies are

311
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
cnas but if we just release things into

312
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,640
the wild then we have a whole another

313
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
problem that we look at so

314
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
again we want to

315
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
be respectful to the developer

316
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,959
and give them the chance to fix it and

317
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,399
we want to

318
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
just be respectful to to our peers right

319
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,480
we're not doing this to damage folks

320
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
we're doing this to help our industry

321
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
it's not an absolute requirement

322
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
it is a best practice

323
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
and if your

324
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,279
developer is not a cna use your best

325
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,399
judgment with response time i usually go

326
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,079
72 hours myself i think 72 hours is a

327
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,760
fair amount of time

328
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
uh you know if you submit it on a

329
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
thursday maybe go you know through

330
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,600
mid-week the next week but if it's a

331
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
maintained application it should be

332
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
expected that they're going to contact

333
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
you back again use your best judgment

334
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,800
here

335
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
so after you've contacted or attempted

336
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
to contact a vendor it's time to apply

337
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,480
for the cv itself and it's done through

338
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,160
cveform.org the submitter needs a valid

339
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
email the number of vulnerabilities to

340
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
report that you have verified the vendor

341
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
is not a registered cna and that you

342
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,519
have verified the vulnerability isn't

343
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,200
already listed you have to do a bit of

344
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
research on that part right

345
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
you can go through the cv data bank or

346
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,079
database to see if that application's

347
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,600
been tested and found to be vulnerable

348
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
before to the vulnerability that you're

349
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,480
reporting

350
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,800
uh you can use google you know search

351
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,279
engines etc to do some of that research

352
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,880
you want to spend a decent amount of

353
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,399
time here

354
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,399
you really would hate to spend a lot of

355
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,320
time submitting your report just to find

356
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,220
that it's a duplicate

357
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,440
[Music]

358
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
so when you go to submit a cve request

359
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
you see some things here on the screen

360
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
again at the top you want to select a

361
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
request type you're reporting a

362
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
vulnerability you enter your email

363
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
address the number of vulnerabilities

364
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
you want to report and again down here

365
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,399
at the bottom you can see that we're

366
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,160
verifying this is not a cna covered

367
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
product

368
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,480
and that it's not already been assigned

369
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,040
to cve

370
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
next you simply describe the

371
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,000
vulnerability type the product vendor

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,519
product name version of vulnerable

373
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,839
software application etc so in this case

374
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,519
this was the sql injection i submitted

375
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
on hotel druid 3.0.2

376
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,959
[Music]

377
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
is the ender confirmed or acknowledged

378
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,120
at this time they didn't it took a while

379
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
longer to get a response back

380
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,920
um but that should be changed after

381
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,240
uh you can always send an update to

382
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
mitre to say hey look they've you know

383
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
they've acknowledged at this point and

384
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,800
it's again just a good practice

385
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
the attack type here was remote because

386
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,079
that's what it was and then you just

387
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,079
insert this information based on your

388
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,480
findings so if you've done bug bounty

389
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,200
before this will look similar to you

390
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
the affected components sqlite database

391
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,480
and

392
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
i just included the one link

393
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
or the one page

394
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,399
uh the attack vector you just want to

395
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,560
specify what it took to do it and the

396
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
description of the vulnerability this

397
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,040
will be what is listed in the cve itself

398
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,959
so you want to make sure that whatever

399
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,519
you want the cv to say is what this says

400
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,760
here

401
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
the cve database is public and a cve

402
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,399
number is only made public if the

403
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,920
finding is as well

404
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,199
so

405
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,720
if you want to

406
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
have the

407
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
finding made public rather than private

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,760
there are a lot of private findings if

409
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,240
you want to be public you need to refer

410
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
or have a public reference made

411
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,920
for your findings so

412
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,519
my recommendation is typically in the

413
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
additional information box down here

414
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
you'll see we'll provide github link

415
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,680
once the idea is issued

416
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,920
you can just create a new github repo

417
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,360
and make it private for now and just

418
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,079
name it whatever your finding is

419
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,320
and then once you receive your cv id you

420
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,680
can change your repo name to

421
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,959
cbe2021 38351 or whatever you want

422
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,680
and then you'll just email back the

423
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,560
uh the person who emails you from from

424
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
miner

425
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
and let them know

426
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,680
uh that link and here you can see me

427
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,079
doing that so you'll receive an email

428
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
eventually confirming the finding or a

429
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,199
denial email requesting more information

430
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
here for instance you see that

431
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
these are reserved so

432
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,600
in the database you might find those

433
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
reserved findings there won't be any

434
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,760
information talking about this here

435
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
it'll simply say reserved and that

436
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
there's a number

437
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
reserved for this finding

438
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,920
so the cv ids are issued and this is the

439
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
time where you would

440
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
update your github repo or whatever

441
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
reference you're using whether it be

442
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
medium or a public website that you have

443
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
etc and then you're just going to

444
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,639
respond to this email with those

445
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,440
reference links

446
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
then after the ids are issued here you

447
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
can see i've changed the names of those

448
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,839
github repos i made them public

449
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,000
in order to reference them and again

450
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,759
reply to the email with the valid links

451
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,160
mitre will eventually make those

452
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
findings public it might take a little

453
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,839
while these are humans doing this this

454
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,079
work and you can imagine how many

455
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,720
requests they get from folks right uh

456
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
whether it be valid requests or people

457
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,000
thinking they have something and it's

458
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
not having to request more information

459
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,639
they are overworked they do a ton of

460
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,800
work so it could take a couple of days

461
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
it could take months i know folks who

462
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,399
have waited months for a finding before

463
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
they've gotten their approval so

464
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,320
um use your best judgment again with

465
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,800
replying or following up to see if

466
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
you're finding or if your submission has

467
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,399
been forgotten about if it's still being

468
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
worked on etc

469
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,320
and then once it is made public nist

470
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
will also assess those findings

471
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,959
and update the resources with a cvss

472
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,040
score this can take many many days or

473
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,199
weeks so just be patient with that as

474
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,199
well

475
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,440
quick note miter does not attribute

476
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
findings to individuals you will not see

477
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,360
your name in the database

478
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
the individual is the owner of the

479
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
reference that's used in the cv id

480
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,839
itself

481
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,759
so it's your responsibility to attribute

482
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,279
yourself to the finding in your

483
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
reference and to maintain and protect

484
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,519
that reference specifically

485
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,800
if you were to

486
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,479
delete that reference if you were to

487
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
not have it anymore

488
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,560
that's the only thing that's attributing

489
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,399
your name specifically to that cb id so

490
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
this is like gold here you just if you

491
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,519
want to be able to leverage this you

492
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,880
need to make sure that you maintain the

493
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,199
reference

494
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,959
and then speaking of leveraging after

495
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,559
you've received a cv idea it's time to

496
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,000
leverage that success right we post it

497
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
to our socials our twitter our linkedin

498
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,520
etc we network it

499
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
i know people who have had it put in

500
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
their local newspapers they've been on

501
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
local news channels before

502
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,919
because they found zero day

503
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,559
vulnerabilities and there's really a lot

504
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
of creative ways to do this so here down

505
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,559
here you can see i've posted up on

506
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,400
twitter and then i post on my linkedin

507
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,720
as well

508
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,480
for those networking channels i have

509
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,799
you also should update your linkedin

510
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
biography your resume and whatever else

511
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
you use whether

512
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
your cover sheets your title line etc

513
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
whatever it is that you're doing so here

514
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
you can see i've updated my

515
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,400
awards on linkedin as well as my resume

516
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
i include my cvs underneath my

517
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,679
certifications and here's a couple

518
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,760
success stories just from some folks who

519
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
have

520
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
um

521
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
in my local discord channel or in my

522
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
discord server who

523
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
uh obtained cves and then got jobs right

524
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,960
a lot of people i know since uh

525
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,799
originally posting the article that this

526
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
presentation is based on

527
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,640
it found work because of this

528
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,320
it truly does work

529
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
the

530
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
cbe market so to speak

531
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,240
is not super saturated people think

532
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
about ways of leveraging how to break

533
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,120
into the industry they're thinking bug

534
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,919
bounty they're thinking ctfs etc this is

535
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,960
something that's

536
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,600
oftentimes forgotten about so

537
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,280
since writing that article in august i

538
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
have seen probably seven or eight people

539
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,679
get job offers because of this process

540
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,000
so i really really recommend

541
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
if you're you know looking to break into

542
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
uh offensive pen testing or offensive

543
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,440
security

544
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,840
that you consider

545
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,320
this a few closing thoughts entry into

546
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,720
security positions can be a huge

547
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
harrowing task right

548
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
a lot of people in the industry who are

549
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,400
already there

550
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
sometimes forget what it was like when

551
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,559
they were trying to get into

552
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,400
uh maybe they didn't have much challenge

553
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,720
right this is still a newer a newer

554
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,039
field so

555
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,240
maybe they just got in by necessity and

556
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
hey we need someone to start doing this

557
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
and they never had to go through the you

558
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,440
know through the fight so to speak

559
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,760
their challenge was developing the tools

560
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
tasks and procedures we use today

561
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,039
um

562
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,000
so please if you break in leave the door

563
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,919
open for the folks behind you make it

564
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,360
easier

565
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,799
for people to

566
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,559
get into this field there are a lot of

567
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,400
technically proficient folks who can get

568
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,360
work

569
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
prop the door open once you're in it

570
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,160
know that there is no one right pathway

571
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
to break in as well so if you're

572
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,679
listening to this talk and you're trying

573
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,280
to become a pen tester you want to

574
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,480
become

575
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,960
a red teamer etc

576
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
there is no one right way

577
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
you really are going to have to make the

578
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,919
best you

579
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,000
and find ways that set you apart from

580
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
all the other applicants and peers so

581
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,320
if all you know if a job requires the

582
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,559
oscp you have to expect that a lot of

583
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,799
people applying are going to have ocp so

584
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,400
what on your resume what in your

585
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,039
experience is going to set you apart

586
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,240
from everyone else and that's why we

587
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
gave the cbe presentation today because

588
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
truly it does set you apart whether you

589
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,240
work as a soccer analyst whether you

590
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
work as a

591
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
security architect or a pen tester

592
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,600
people understand what a cv is

593
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,520
and finally make yourself seen

594
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
this can be hard

595
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,840
i myself am very very introverted so

596
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,000
being seen being public is difficult and

597
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,400
it was crazy as a mayor trying to be

598
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,720
introverted while being a person of the

599
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,400
people so to speak

600
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,760
but you have to make sure you have to

601
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
make sure that people are seeing you

602
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520

603
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880

606
