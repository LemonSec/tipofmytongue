9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
i don't know how many awards you've won

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,160
for women of the year women in cyber

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,119
security of the year all women teaching

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,560
in cyber security of the year i don't

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,720
know there's so many of them

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,840
i don't have a list of them i don't

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,920
think it would fit on the screen anyway

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
um but yeah i would like to welcome you

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,360
tia hopkins to the to the stage

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,610
[Applause]

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,559
i always get really embarrassed when i

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
get uh introduced because i'm like all i

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,879
do is wake up in the morning do a couple

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,800
nice things and go to bed at night

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,399
that's the goal let me find my

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,160
clicker i think i put my clicker in my

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,559
bag one second

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
all right so

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,360
we're going to talk about what classic

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,759
arcade gaming can teach us about

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,200
cyber security and by the end of this

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
thing you'll tell me whether

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
i'm on to something or not and i'm open

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,640
to the honesty so

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
let's get right into this thing

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
so when i was thinking about this uh

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,000
this presentation i took a step back and

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
i'm like okay when i hear ghosts in the

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
machine what

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
what do i think about

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
and the first thing that came to mind

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
honestly was

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,719
when you take your car to the mechanic

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,479
for making that noise that it makes all

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
the time the really really annoying

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,560
noise but then you get there

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,079
and it doesn't make the noise anymore

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
right and the mechanic's like

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
well if you could just show me what it's

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
doing that'd be great that's that's

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,360
fantastic maybe we could do something

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,319
about it

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,879
so i was like well you know i don't know

52
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,400
that folks attending a cyber security

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
conference would want to spend an hour

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
talking about auto mechanics so i'm

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,319
going to need something else here so a

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,720
turn to my most trusted advisors for

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,239
some advice

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,599
my two sons

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,879
14 and 8 years old so i asked my 14 year

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,319
old hey

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,519
what do you what do you think when you

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,599
hear ghost in the machine and he's like

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,879
oh mom it's definitely the ghost

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,000
in the dryer i do my laundry

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,640
i wash it i dry it i fold it all up i'm

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
missing a sock

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,120
i look everywhere for it okay i can't

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
find it i finally make peace and say

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,920
goodbye to the lonely sock in my drawer

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
and then all of a sudden

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,599
it's back in the dryer i don't

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
understand mom

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
it's very frustrating

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
i said son i understand i agree with you

75
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,000
that was number two on my list

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
still got this cyber security problem

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
so i turned to my eight-year-old this

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
guy's a genius

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
and he says

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,959
well

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,640
it's a ghost

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,159
and

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,760
it's coming after you

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,519
so you got to run away

85
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,280
and it's in a game

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
and you're trapped

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
and also

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
can i have a donut

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
thanks kid appreciate that sure you can

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
have a donut so they're both like mom

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
what is this for why are you asking us

92
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,680
this is like well i'm speaking at a

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,920
cyber security summit and the theme is

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
ghost in the machine so i got to talk

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
about ghosts in the machine does that

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,920
change your answers

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
nope

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
all right good talk guys thanks

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
so i turned to

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
uh the actual um

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
the blurb of the conference itself

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
and so i wanted to bring it up here just

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
in case someone hadn't had the

104
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,040
opportunity to to see it and i'll read

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
through it so it's when our computers do

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
something unexpected or start to make

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
changes to documents and auto launch

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,280
things we didn't click on randomly

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
reboot we call it a ghost and when it's

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,120
extreme we call it a menacing ghost

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
so today i'm i'm going to eventually get

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,880
to the point of talking about the ghosts

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,358
in the machines of our cyber security

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
programs but first

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,360
a bit more on my process so this was my

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,040
presentation a short while ago this was

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
all of it and i don't know what i was

118
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,160
going to talk about with this for for an

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
hour but

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,639
eventually a light bulb went off and i

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,000
was like oh my goodness i can't believe

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
i didn't think about this before

123
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,120
my most my earliest memories of ghost in

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,400
the machine

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
went along something like this

126
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,080
[Music]

127
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
yes

128
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
pac-man

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
the first ghost ever in a machine in my

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,199
life

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,600
and so i'm an educator okay so you're

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
gonna have to bear with me a little bit

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
here you never know maybe there's

134
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
someone that doesn't know what pac-man

135
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
is so let's go through this

136
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
so it's an action maze game right we're

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
moving pac-man through this maze we're

138
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,840
trying to eat dots and we're trying to

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
avoid ghosts

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
tia's definition most iconic arcade game

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
ever few facts about the game the

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
objective is to eat all the dots in the

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,120
maze while avoiding the ghosts there are

144
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,560
244 dots in the maze

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
240 tiny ones and the four power-up

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
dots

147
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
you get points by eating the dots eating

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,000
the vulnerable ghosts which turn blue

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
when you eat a power-up dot and fruit

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,080
255 levels now

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
couple of fun facts

152
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
after you pass level 19 in this game the

153
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,000
ghosts don't turn blue anymore and the

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,600
game isn't actually over at level 255

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,520
it's just unplayable after that because

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,319
once you get to 256 half the screen

157
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,199
glitches uh due to an integer overflow

158
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,720
which is so strange but people still

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
continue to play there's a whole write

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
up on how you can still continue to play

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,759
while not being able to see half of the

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,280
screen it's insane

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,199
almost done with this

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,960
so quick history lesson

165
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,160
the game was released in japan in may of

166
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
1980 and that's the name of it um feel

167
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
free to read that i cannot

168
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
uh in 1980 in october

169
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,400
midway purchased the rights to pacman

170
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,520
and so when the translation came over

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
because pac-man looked like a hockey

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
puck this is i thought this was really

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,600
funny and interesting it was translated

174
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
to puckman

175
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
which didn't last very long because they

176
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,720
were concerned about arcade games being

177
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,199
defaced with the p being turned into a

178
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,880
different letter and i'll leave it there

179
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
so they changed it to pac-man which is

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,639
actually closer to

181
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,919
the original intention um when it was uh

182
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,759
released in japan because the japanese

183
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,639
name actually translates to something

184
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,199
closer to paku paku which means to

185
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,120
gobble things up so changing it from

186
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,400
puckman to pac-man actually got us

187
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
closer to um what was originally

188
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
intended 1982 my fave miss pac-man was

189
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,039
released and then in 2021 some keynote

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,000
speaker randomly tried to associate

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,720
pacman with cyber security so i'd say

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
the game's having a pretty good run

193
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,000
all right so let's get into this thing

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
and meet our ghosts

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,240
in the machine we have blinky pinky inky

196
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
and clyde

197
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,120
and i think this slide right here is

198
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
enough to tie it to cyber security

199
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,599
because blinky pinky inky

200
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,120
you get in a groove you're expecting

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,599
something like stinky maybe and you get

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,240
clyde and cyber security as soon as we

203
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,639
think we found a pattern well then we

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,240
find an anomaly and we're back to the

205
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,479
drawing board so just a bit about the

206
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,520
the names here blinkies our chaser

207
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,120
and in the midway version um we call

208
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
blinky shadow

209
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,879
pinkies are ambusher and midway called

210
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,440
them speedy which the speedy translation

211
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
in the u.s is not

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,759
really really accurate because pinkie's

213
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
not faster than any of the other ghosts

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,319
or ambushers actually more accurate inky

215
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,039
is intended to be unpredictable uh u.s

216
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,520
translation is bashful and

217
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
clyde

218
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
it's pain ignorance

219
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,039
and pokey so we're going to talk about

220
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,280
the personalities of these ghosts and

221
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,400
that's how we're going to get into cyber

222
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,240
security but first

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,039
one more detour what about sue anybody

224
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,479
think about sue when i was going through

225
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,599
the ghosts

226
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,880
i was thinking about so it was like what

227
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
happened with two and i looked it up and

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
was like oh sue did not release with

229
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,519
pac-man she released with miss pac-man

230
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
so i just this slides for me more than

231
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,880
anything so

232
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,560
thanks for hanging out with me

233
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,680
all right

234
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
so tia what does all of this have

235
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,760
anything to do

236
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,839
with cyber security

237
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,519
and the connection for me is ttps the

238
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,680
tactics techniques

239
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
and procedures of these goals so

240
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,120
why are they even doing the things that

241
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
they're doing how are they doing the

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,800
thing that they're doing and what

243
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
specifically enables them to do the

244
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
things that they're doing and we're

245
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
going to tie those things uh to some

246
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,720
cyber security concerns that we should

247
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
be paying attention to in the coming 12

248
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
to 18 months

249
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,320
so in terms of what to look at uh what

250
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
to look out for so eastern tire has a

251
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,680
team of individuals that do thread intel

252
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,800
research

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
look for advanced detection mechanisms

254
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,519
to to enable us to find

255
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,920
more i would say advanced ways to detect

256
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
and respond to attacks and then we have

257
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
a team that creates or writes the run

258
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
books associated with those detections

259
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
and then we also have a team of

260
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
distinguished security professionals

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,600
that also do research and come up with

262
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
innovative ideas to contribute to our

263
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
efforts as well and these teams are

264
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
constantly performing research into

265
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,399
trends

266
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
what's happening in the industry what

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,920
should organizations be paying to paying

268
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
attention to so so this is a lot of what

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
i'm going to go over here is is their

270
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,440
research

271
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
so we'll start with blinky

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,360
the tactic for all these ghosts the dead

273
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
giveaway is the catch pac-man

274
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,959
i mean yeah just in case you didn't know

275
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,200
blinky's technique is to meet pac-man

276
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
where he is okay

277
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
and the way that he does that blink his

278
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
procedure is to target pac-man's current

279
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,279
tile so pac-man moves through the maze

280
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,880
on tiles there are tiles in the

281
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,079
background of the screen that you

282
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,040
typically can't see so when blinky is

283
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,519
targeting back uh pac-man what he does

284
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,360
is look for the title that he's in and

285
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,279
he just goes right there so for me

286
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,079
mentally that translates to attackers

287
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,839
meeting our users

288
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
where they are in order to infiltrate

289
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
our environments so what popped into my

290
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
mind when i was thinking about blinky

291
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,800
was initial access

292
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,079
and so

293
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,640
attackers are becoming a lot more

294
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,120
innovative when it comes to how

295
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
they're approaching getting into our

296
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
environments to to achieve or to

297
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
accomplish their objectives and the

298
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,680
reality of it is our technologies are

299
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
becoming more and more advanced

300
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,920
they're able to detect a lot more things

301
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
our response capabilities both in our

302
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,320
organizations with our service providers

303
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
are becoming more advanced we're

304
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,519
becoming more aware

305
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
so why deal with all that you know time

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,920
is money in our world but time is money

307
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,040
and it also in their world so why not

308
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,839
just trick a user into doing what i need

309
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,200
them to do so i don't have to worry

310
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
about circumventing all these

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
technologies and i'm sure a lot of these

312
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
you're familiar with but

313
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,079
when it comes to search engine

314
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,600
optimization that one kind of blew my

315
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
mind when i started reading about it

316
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,839
attackers are actually leveraging search

317
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,040
engine optimization to plant information

318
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
into

319
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
what users will find when they go to web

320
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
browsers so you go to google and you're

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,279
looking for you got to put a

322
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,720
presentation together so you need a

323
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
template i needed a template for this

324
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
presentation so users search for these

325
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
templates

326
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
and they find them

327
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,000
but they're actually executables

328
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
but attackers are using search engine

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
optimization to make sure that these

330
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,839
searches come up higher in the chain or

331
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,720
higher in the search results for users

332
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
and so users will download these click

333
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,399
on them thinking oh i've got this

334
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,399
amazing powerpoint presentation that i'm

335
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,880
going to modify it's a drive by download

336
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
they're in your environment off to the

337
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,040
races and i think that is

338
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,240
totally in insane um but also what that

339
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,399
says and on the keynote yesterday was

340
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,480
saying a lot of this as well our the

341
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
attackers are using the same

342
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,480
technologies we are but more so than

343
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,760
they have been ever in the past so you

344
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,279
know you think about something as simple

345
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,360
as search engine optimization all the

346
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
way up to something as advanced as

347
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
artificial intelligence and attacks that

348
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,720
are being enabled with artificial

349
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
intelligence so moving on to supply

350
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,399
chain compromise i mean there's no

351
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,240
secret um you know with what's going on

352
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
there you think about the solarwinds

353
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
hack all things where you know they are

354
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
targeting a different target to get to

355
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,560
the ultimate outcome so i don't think i

356
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
need to spend too much time on that and

357
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
then zero day vulnerabilities right the

358
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
idea there being patch patch patch so

359
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
with initial access we have to make sure

360
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,880
our users are aware

361
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,480
we have to go back to basics and make

362
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
sure we're regularly patching and we

363
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,200
also have to continuously validate the

364
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,519
security practices and controls in place

365
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,320
for our third-party partners and vendors

366
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
okay

367
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
moving on to pinky

368
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,000
tactic you guessed it catch pac-man

369
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
technique

370
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,760
predict where pac-man is going

371
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,639
and pinky's procedure is to target four

372
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,440
tiles ahead of pac-man's current tile so

373
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
wherever pac-man is

374
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
pinky is going to calculate four tiles

375
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,240
ahead of that

376
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,519
and go there

377
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,320
but i mean dead on just coming after

378
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,639
pac-man like nothing ever so when i

379
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,560
think of pinkie i think okay my blood

380
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,720
pressure's going up pinkie's that ghost

381
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,399
that causes me to make really poor

382
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,560
decisions in the game and make bad

383
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
choices and it's usually pinky um that

384
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,920
catches me so what that made me think of

385
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
is ransomware

386
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,760
and where ransomware is going right my

387
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
first memories of matt of ransomware

388
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,399
were okay we encrypted your data pay us

389
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,240
and we'll give it back to you but that

390
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
is advanced because we started to say

391
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,199
well my data's backed up have fun

392
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
so then attackers came back and said

393
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
i see your backup and i raise you the

394
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
fact that i have found it and deleted it

395
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,360
so what now

396
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
and we're like wow all right well let me

397
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,800
think about this

398
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,399
all right well i got more backups i'm

399
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,040
fine and attackers are like all right

400
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,000
well

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
i've got your backup

402
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
but i also have your data and if you

403
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,079
don't pay me i'm gonna leak it on the

404
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,360
dark web

405
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
so how about that and it just keeps

406
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
getting worse and worse and worse and

407
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,800
the idea behind ransomware now is just

408
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,519
apply all the pressure to get

409
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,440
what what they want and something else

410
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
that that the keynote mentioned

411
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
yesterday was that a lot of in a lot of

412
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,839
cases these attackers know

413
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,680
how much your cyber insurance policy

414
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,639
will pay

415
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,040
and so they leverage that information to

416
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
set the ransom that they're going to

417
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
charge you to not only release your data

418
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,959
to you but also not serve it up on the

419
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,440
dark web which is which is crazy um so i

420
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
covered and then um

421
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,800
just i skipped over the point of

422
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
expansion to cloud and mobile i mean if

423
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
i think about my personal machine if

424
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
something on my personal computer were

425
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
to get ransomed i'd be okay but if

426
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,959
something happened to my iphone

427
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,399
i probably

428
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,639
lose my mind right and and i think most

429
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,639
of us are in that situation where a lot

430
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
of times we live on our devices i'll be

431
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
sitting at my desk my laptop is right in

432
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,560
front of me and i'm emailing and doing

433
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
all kinds of things on my phone and

434
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,199
cloud as well you think about ransomware

435
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
in the case of like a data center or

436
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,959
on-prem environment

437
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
spreading from from server to server and

438
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,040
encrypting files in a share think about

439
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,639
what would happen if

440
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,880
that happened in sharepoint

441
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
that would be

442
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
in insane and these are the directions

443
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,639
that these these attacks are heading

444
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,279
wherever attackers think we're going

445
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,800
that's where they want to be so that we

446
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
can say so that they can say when we

447
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
come back to them with well we got this

448
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
we're not going to do that yeah we

449
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
already got that so yeah go ahead go

450
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,320
ahead and pay that money

451
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
and then lastly ransomware as a service

452
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,279
and specialization this thing is it's a

453
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
full-on business it's not opportunistic

454
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,639
it's not a few guys hanging out in a

455
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,560
basement seeing who they can get money

456
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
from

457
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
these ransomware gangs are

458
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,279
operationalizing their businesses and

459
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,759
their gangs the way we operationalize

460
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,680
our security teams and they're

461
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,639
specializing now it's it's okay

462
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
i'm going to specialize in um

463
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
initial entry i'm going to specialize in

464
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,720
establishing a foothold i'm going to

465
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
specialize in the distribution of the

466
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,519
malware and i'm going to specialize in

467
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
achieving those objectives and like

468
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
they're building partnerships

469
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,839
like our organizations build

470
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
partnerships right like i'm a managed

471
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,439
services provider i'm going to partner

472
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,199
with the security firm to deliver a full

473
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
package to my customers and ransomware

474
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,000
group gangs are doing the exact same

475
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
thing which makes it incredibly

476
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,359
challenging for us and another thing

477
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,679
that they're doing is actually releasing

478
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,079
the information around how they're doing

479
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
the things that they're doing so it

480
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,679
becomes public knowledge which makes

481
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,400
attribution incredibly incredibly hard

482
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
all right

483
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,320
inky

484
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,960
is unpredictable

485
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,360
but he also wants to catch pacman

486
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,160
his technique is to be confusing and

487
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,280
this one i'm gonna have to look at my

488
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,000
notes for because it is um it's pretty

489
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
insane

490
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
so the way he establishes his target is

491
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,039
by

492
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
calculating it's a combination of

493
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,919
pac-man's location and blinky's location

494
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,880
so if pac-man's here and blinky's here

495
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,200
all right inky draws a vector between

496
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,440
the two doubles it and that's where inky

497
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
goes for pac-man which makes it very

498
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,120
unpredictable because blinky

499
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,440
is also moving so for inky he's the only

500
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,559
ghost that considers multiple factors

501
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
when targeting pac-man so that made me

502
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
think of the spike

503
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
that we can expect in identity-based

504
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,880
attacks when it comes to multi-factor

505
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
authentication oauth fishing and deep

506
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,320
fake fishing

507
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,480
so multi-factor authentication

508
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
interception

509
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
what are we talking about here that's

510
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
you know if you're using sms which by

511
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,679
the way is considered i mean

512
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,120
multi-factor listen don't get me wrong

513
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,360
we all need multi-factor authentication

514
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,640
i'm shocked

515
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
when i have conversations where it's not

516
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,919
in place

517
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,000
and we're getting better but we also

518
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
need to get to a place where it's

519
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
enforced and i understand that it's a

520
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
it's a huge lift right it's a bit of a

521
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
lift to get multi-factor authentication

522
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
rolled out to the organization to get

523
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
users to adopt it etc

524
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,840
but it's a much much bigger problem when

525
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,039
you don't have it in place and then

526
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,559
you're dealing with some sort of event

527
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,840
because an attacker was able to gain

528
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
access to your environment so anyway

529
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,799
back to

530
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,640
sms so sms is considered one of the um

531
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
the least secure methods for

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,840
multi-factor authentication because of

533
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
its susceptibility to interception so

534
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
i'm just getting a text message on my

535
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,120
phone

536
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
to to to serve as my means for

537
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,799
multi-factor authentication you think

538
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,200
about things like sms

539
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
i'm sorry

540
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,440
sim swapping not sms sim swapping when

541
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
you uh when an attacker leverages social

542
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,679
engineering to to do a

543
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
provider a cell service or mobile

544
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,080
service provider into moving

545
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
service from a phone number to a

546
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,840
different sim that they have control

547
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,720
over or move the service to an entirely

548
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,200
different provider all together right so

549
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
that's why that's considered

550
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,400
one of the least secure methods again

551
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,559
that's that's a lot of work and the idea

552
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,400
here is not to say oh i have

553
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
multi-factor authentication so we're

554
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
totally safe we're good we all we all

555
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
know better than that because if

556
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
anything in this industry tools

557
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,440
processes whatever if anything just

558
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
worked we'd all be out of work and we

559
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
wouldn't be having these conferences and

560
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,919
i'd be doing my dream job popping

561
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,760
popcorn at a movie theater i'm going to

562
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
do that one day i promise

563
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,000
so the the most secure method of

564
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,679
multi-factor authentication today is

565
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,240
considered mobile push and one-time

566
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
password is another mechanism but that's

567
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,799
also susceptible to

568
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,200
again social engineering because a user

569
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,559
could be tricked into giving that

570
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,880
password up or to

571
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,320
you know logging in and providing their

572
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,080
credentials and the one-time password

573
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,919
into a malicious website

574
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,840
but mobile push

575
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
it's just a push right to the device

576
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,760
right did you did you request

577
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
authentication to this thing the user

578
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
accepts and and you're fine

579
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,720
but the the sort of caveat there is that

580
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,280
you want to make sure that when the user

581
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,679
is accepting that they there's a way you

582
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,039
can indicate

583
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,880
where the request is coming from right

584
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
because a lot of times we're busy

585
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,919
something comes through you get this

586
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,000
request and oh yeah i think i maybe

587
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
tried to log into onedrive

588
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,039
two hours ago so yeah i'll go ahead and

589
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,960
accept that thing but if you have the

590
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,200
time and you have where the request came

591
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,080
from the user can clearly see well

592
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,600
i'm sitting in my home office in new

593
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,039
york why in the world did this come from

594
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,600
kalamazoo at least that's something to

595
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,760
tip the user off to maybe i shouldn't be

596
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
approving this thing okay

597
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,039
oauth fishing oauth phishing well oauth

598
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,640
let's talk about that first that's what

599
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,919
like microsoft facebook google

600
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,480
these organizations use to authenticate

601
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
applications to have access to user data

602
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
so for example you book a flight through

603
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,320
expedia and all of a sudden it shows up

604
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,559
on your google calendar okay

605
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,640
oh off fifth oauth fishing is really

606
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,720
just fishing still right where attackers

607
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
are trying to get users to give them

608
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
this information give me access to your

609
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
account so i can set up forwarders so i

610
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,640
can get access to being connected into

611
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,000
the same things that you're connected

612
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
into and i can send emails and i can

613
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,039
change your information i can do these

614
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,240
things again

615
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
social engineering at the crux of all

616
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,400
this is social engineering and i get a

617
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,240
lot of eye rolls when i talk about user

618
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
education security awareness training

619
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
but at the end of the day that's what

620
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
it's coming down to all right and then

621
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
deep fake fishing has to be the one that

622
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,720
scares me the most because

623
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,159
it's

624
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,480
we're very excited about ai and all the

625
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
things that ai means in terms of what

626
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
we'll be able to do there was a video

627
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,600
played yesterday where it was like if

628
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,760
you're a busy ceo when you love the

629
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
ability to just record your voice and

630
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,480
have it be learned and be able to make

631
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,640
statements and put out announcements and

632
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,080
things like that without ever having to

633
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,600
be there without ever having to find

634
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,840
time in your busy schedule to do so

635
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,080
well yeah that's awesome except that

636
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,480
someone else could also do that and make

637
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,440
me say all sorts of things that i never

638
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
said

639
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
and we're starting to see in the news

640
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
where uh deep fake fishing is being

641
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,480
leveraged to you know trick people into

642
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,440
making payments or to to deliver false

643
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
information

644
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,760
so this is this is very scary and the

645
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,240
the idea of remote work and the

646
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,760
distributed workforce makes this

647
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
really

648
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
a really big concern because you have

649
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
you think about it you have individuals

650
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
that were hired say during covid that

651
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,880
have never even seen their boss never

652
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,799
met their boss doesn't know

653
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,600
the the posture the the body language of

654
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,919
their boss and so if they get

655
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,520
a voicemail

656
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,840
that's a deep fake and their boss is

657
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,240
saying i need you to wire a million

658
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,880
dollars to blah blah blah well i mean

659
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,080
most likely they're going to do it

660
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
especially if there's some sort of

661
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,600
emotional driver behind it i need you to

662
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,799
do this before in a day or we're going

663
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,080
to lose this deal like all those

664
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
emotional things that that really good

665
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
social engineering attackers pylon to

666
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,400
drive

667
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,080
users to do what they want them to do so

668
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,159
moving on to

669
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,760
clyde i roll my eyes every time i say

670
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
cloud i really have a problem with this

671
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
name

672
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
i do it's just give me some give me

673
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
something else inky like just just be

674
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,240
consistent anyway

675
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,919
all right so

676
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,080
what's clyde want to do catch pac-man

677
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,400
technique is to be elusive

678
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,559
and the procedure is

679
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,480
so clyde changes his persona based on

680
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
his proximity

681
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,440
to pac-man and so that the idea behind

682
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,559
that is i gotta look at my notes here

683
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,520
if

684
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
clyde is more than eight tiles away from

685
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,320
pac-man then he takes on the persona of

686
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,120
blinky which is just going to where

687
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,200
pac-man is if clyde is less than eight

688
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
tiles away from pac-man he goes to the

689
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,559
bottom left-hand corner of the screen so

690
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,919
basically clyde becomes who he needs to

691
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,640
be

692
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,799
based on the situation which led my mind

693
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,520
to social engineering which honestly

694
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,000
we've been talking about the entire time

695
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,840
with all these different the other types

696
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
of threats that that that we've been

697
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
talking through here so i didn't want to

698
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,279
list the social engineering types that

699
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,360
we're all familiar with like like

700
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
fishing and spear fishing and whaling

701
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
and things like that but what i did want

702
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,320
to do is categorize them just to to get

703
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,000
us thinking about the different ways it

704
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,159
can happen because again at the end of

705
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
the day it boils down to making sure our

706
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
users are aware of all the ways that um

707
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,159
they can be compromised that leads to a

708
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,640
business compromise and so all familiar

709
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
with internet email

710
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
phone i'm going to call you i'm going to

711
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,279
get you to give me your credit card

712
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,360
information or i'm going to email you

713
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,400
and i'm going to give you the winning

714
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,320
lottery numbers or i'mma send you a cute

715
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,080
kitty photo and you're gonna click that

716
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
link because you're having a great day

717
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,120
and you just think it's your lucky day

718
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
to be a millionaire or you just can't

719
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,120
resist kitties one or the other um and

720
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,799
then the internet like was talking about

721
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
with uh with search engine optimization

722
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
and things like that human interaction

723
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
i was watching uh 9-1-1 not too long ago

724
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
it's one of my favorite shows it's so

725
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
good if you haven't watched it you

726
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,279
should and then you can be very upset

727
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,480
with me when you get addicted to it

728
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,320
because there's like 13 000 seasons but

729
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,799
it's awesome

730
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,919
one of the individuals on the show

731
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,000
was in a dating app

732
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,559
met someone talked to them for a couple

733
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,880
weeks oh i think i found my person i'm

734
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,760
so excited we're gonna go on a date they

735
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
go out the guy gets beat up

736
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,679
doesn't know why

737
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,240
and then a week later in the 911 call

738
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,480
center there's a takeover

739
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
and so

740
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,880
this guy was targeted so that they could

741
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,000
not not not steal his key card they made

742
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,679
a copy of it because they knew if they

743
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,240
took it then that would alert hey

744
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,400
something's going on we need to like you

745
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
know beef up security but they took a

746
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
copy of it they had some machine they

747
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
copied it and they put it back and then

748
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,799
they took over the 911 call center

749
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,080
because they had access to the whole

750
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
building because this guy was pretty

751
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
high up in the company

752
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
that all started

753
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,919
with an online dating app so how much

754
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,120
research

755
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
did this attacker do on this individual

756
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,760
to set up a profile that this individual

757
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,240
would find attractive and then have

758
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,640
these conversations to keep them engaged

759
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,400
and go on a date with them i mean that's

760
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,799
a commitment right these attackers are

761
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,360
are committed but these things can

762
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,720
happen and

763
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,440
it's hard to say hey don't don't be

764
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
paranoid we still want to live but i

765
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,600
mean by some stretch we kind of have to

766
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,320
be you know i i am still kind of in the

767
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,720
camp of trust but verify but i'm

768
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
definitely not full-on in the in the

769
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
trust camp i i do verify everything

770
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,480
really really leaning more toward

771
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,640
pessimism and and paranoia the more i

772
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,159
read what's going on um in the world so

773
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,240
and then passive that's like shoulder

774
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,840
surfing so i'm going to stand over your

775
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,200
shoulder pretend i'm talking to you

776
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
about the weather while you're typing in

777
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
your password or i'm going to ask you

778
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,320
for direction somewhere when you're

779
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,039
putting your your pin in at an atm and

780
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,960
things like that so

781
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
these are the categories i think it's

782
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,240
really important when we're

783
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,559
communicating with our users the types

784
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
of things that they need to look out for

785
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,399
i think our users are wired to just

786
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,240
think about phishing let me just make

787
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,399
sure i'm not clicking on a bad link but

788
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,640
i mean it's way bigger than this

789
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,919
and it's something i didn't touch on

790
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,200
when i was talking about ransomware i

791
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,480
actually want to go back to that for a

792
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,440
moment is you know we we say

793
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,679
cyber security isn't an i.t problem it's

794
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,600
a business problem and that's true but

795
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
it's becoming more than that it's

796
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
becoming a matter of human life it's

797
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,320
becoming a matter of human safety right

798
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,720
you think about the pipeline hack

799
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
that had people going to the gas station

800
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
literally filling up plastic bags with

801
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,600
gasoline for fear of running out of gas

802
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,279
i live in greensboro south carolina so

803
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,279
it happened in my backyard and it was

804
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,120
pretty crazy and you had airlines that

805
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,559
had to ground planes because they

806
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,919
couldn't get fuel for the jets and

807
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,399
things like that but then you also read

808
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,600
stories

809
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,080
like the lady that died on her way to a

810
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,240
second hospital after she was turned

811
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,640
away from the first hospital she went to

812
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,559
because they were under attack

813
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,000
from ransomware

814
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,159
that's the first case at least in my

815
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,799
research that was reported

816
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,440
as ransomware being linked to the death

817
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,640
of of a human and it's it's getting

818
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,159
really serious

819
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,799
it is really about more than

820
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,120
corporate sustainability it's about more

821
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,000
than protecting brand and and corporate

822
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,399
reputation it really is a matter of

823
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,320
human life and i was in the elevator

824
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,559
this morning and a gentleman got in and

825
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,000
he said how many people are at this

826
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,679
summit i was like oh quite a few he's

827
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,840
like that's great cyber summit's great

828
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,919
we definitely need more people for

829
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,279
protection

830
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,720
i was like yeah that's right we're like

831
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,080
the modern day warriors we're going to

832
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,159
do this thing but it's true right we

833
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,960
have to be i think gone other days are

834
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
going are the days of bhutan ground and

835
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
and kind of fighting fighting the war

836
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
that way the war is

837
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
increasingly becoming digital and you

838
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
know all of us are are the warriors and

839
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,480
we have to make sure what we know what

840
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,600
we're looking out for and doing the

841
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
right things so

842
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
leveling up

843
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,679
how do we do that

844
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,760
we got to go back to basics do not roll

845
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,000
your eyes when i say

846
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,039
people

847
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,240
process

848
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
technology

849
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,120
okay you can roll your eyes i get it

850
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,679
we've been talking about it forever

851
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,320
but it's still it's not that

852
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,840
we need to stop talking about that and

853
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,520
start talking about something else i

854
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
think we need to continue talking about

855
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
these things but we need to make sure

856
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,279
we're talking about everything that we

857
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,960
need to be talking about considering all

858
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,919
the things that we need to be

859
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,559
considering and not just doing things

860
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,320
the way we've always done them we need

861
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
to ask the hard questions we need to ask

862
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,000
why are we doing this this way is this

863
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the right process is this the right

864
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,240
procedure so just keeping with the theme

865
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,559
for a second if i if i turn things on

866
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,840
myself

867
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,480
and for for pac-man for a moment

868
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,279
and

869
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,520
think about a people perspective

870
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,799
all right so how can i get better or

871
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,559
do i just suck at this game should i go

872
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,200
play fogger or something like that

873
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
from a process perspective do i have the

874
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
right strategy should i be approaching

875
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,120
this

876
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,039
a different way do i know do i know

877
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,519
enough about these ghosts right to level

878
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,360
my game up and and perform better next

879
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,279
time and then from a technology

880
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,200
perspective i'll tell you i'll tell you

881
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
a quick story so

882
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,240
at the beginning of covet i was

883
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,880
traveling all the time i think if i was

884
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,679
home

885
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,519
three days a week i was i was having a

886
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,919
good week so needless to say when travel

887
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,480
was shut down i was home i was kind of i

888
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,399
was kind of lost like everyone had their

889
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,840
little corners their little things that

890
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,279
they did at the end of the day and i'm

891
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,640
sitting there like

892
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,159
i need something to do

893
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,360
so

894
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,559
i'm a project person i built an arcade

895
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,000
in my basement

896
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,720
so i got these quarter cades from arcade

897
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,960
one up i got pac-man i got mortal kombat

898
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,080
i got street fighter and marvel

899
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,519
it's awesome

900
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,799
i didn't get a lot of work done when i

901
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,159
first finished it but i've gotten it

902
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,840
together now much better

903
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,320
um but when i got it all set up i was

904
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,159
playing pac-man and frogger because i

905
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,320
wanted to show my youngest son what a

906
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,799
boss i am at these games and i lost both

907
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,720
of the games at like

908
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,000
level three

909
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
and i was upset

910
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,399
and my first comment was oh this

911
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,240
joystick is garbage i need a new

912
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
joystick it's trash

913
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,640
and the funny thing is we do that a lot

914
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
in cyber security we have a problem

915
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,320
and we turn

916
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,440
to tech

917
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
but then tech becomes a problem because

918
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,159
we have tool sprawl our tools are making

919
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,240
too much noise we don't know what to do

920
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,320
with the information coming out of them

921
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
so i do think that i mean don't get me

922
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,440
wrong technology does solve problems but

923
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
it doesn't solve all problems and we

924
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
need to make sure we're solving the

925
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,600
right problems

926
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,039
so

927
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,600
focusing on people from a cyber security

928
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,240
perspective of course

929
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,679
i'm going to get into the communication

930
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,240
bit in a second but just really pushing

931
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,960
on

932
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,080
user education and awareness our users

933
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,640
cannot be responsible for information

934
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,120
that they don't have we can't assume our

935
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,240
users know anything we wake up in this

936
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,840
world every day we live in this world

937
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,120
we're reading the news but our users are

938
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,440
looking at cat videos and shopping on

939
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,840
ebay in amazon and looking for

940
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,320
powerpoint templates to get their job

941
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
done so we have to take it upon

942
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,120
ourselves to tell them what to look out

943
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,000
for

944
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
but we also have to communicate with our

945
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,320
users in a way where this information is

946
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,760
is going to stick

947
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,320
i was speaking on a panel last week and

948
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,000
i made the joke that

949
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,679
the only thing i liked about security

950
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,760
awareness training a couple years ago at

951
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,080
my company was the fact that we got free

952
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,679
pizza

953
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,799
because

954
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,240
who wants to go to security awareness

955
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,679
training right

956
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,640
and everyone left but it's true you know

957
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,799
what are our users actually getting out

958
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,159
of our security awareness training

959
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,399
programs are we training them on the

960
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,320
right things so i really just kind of

961
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
wanted to wanted to touch on that

962
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,760
because the way we train our users are

963
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
the way our users are are going to

964
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,159
respond it's just like pro athletes i

965
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,360
don't know what the heck's going on with

966
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,440
kansas city but i think they might need

967
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,719
to train a little differently because

968
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,918
they don't look like the team they look

969
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,359
like last year or the year before i'm

970
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,440
just saying okay we can cut that part

971
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,879
out of the recording because that's

972
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,320
that's my wife's favorite team so i

973
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,599
didn't say that

974
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,320
um so anyway getting to what i have up

975
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,520
here

976
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,639
communication within our security teams

977
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,679
communication across the business from

978
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,879
our security teams i think and this is

979
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,119
this is world according to tia

980
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,719
that a big challenge we have in the

981
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,719
cyber security industry right now is the

982
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,918
fact that cyber security is seen as a

983
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,839
separate discipline

984
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,879
when in actuality it's an overlay of

985
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,839
every other function of it and i feel

986
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,960
like that we should treat our security

987
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
teams that way and our business instead

988
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,079
of all of these organizational units and

989
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,320
here's the security team over here our

990
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,960
security teams should be an overlay to

991
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,839
every function of the business it drives

992
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,119
awareness it drives communication it has

993
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,880
the security puts the security team in a

994
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,400
position to be seen as a business

995
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,040
enabler instead of a roadblock and it

996
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,240
just fosters a feedback loop that can

997
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,280
help mature security programs

998
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
tremendously

999
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,040
so along those lines you know here's

1000
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,960
some considerations for for getting that

1001
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
done

1002
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
when you establish

1003
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,200
your programs when you establish your

1004
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,359
processes and you determine what your

1005
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,640
approaches are

1006
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,920
begin

1007
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,400
with the end and in mind what are we

1008
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,320
trying to accomplish here and that's

1009
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
what you need to work towards i think

1010
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,640
i'm guilty of this too as a technical

1011
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,440
individual myself i'm focused on well

1012
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,200
how am i going to get there

1013
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
what are you going to do

1014
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,960
and i'll get wrapped around the actual

1015
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
on features and functionality and how

1016
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,119
does it deploy and how much does it cost

1017
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,040
and what's it take to rip it out

1018
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,280
and i'm not thinking about i'm thinking

1019
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,119
more about the moment that i'm in

1020
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,359
instead of where i'm trying to go and

1021
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,920
that leads to sometimes not making the

1022
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,760
best decisions for our teams and for our

1023
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,079
organizations because ultimately i don't

1024
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,359
care if you're studying for a security

1025
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,800
plus a cissp a cism

1026
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,280
all of the answers come to the questions

1027
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,480
come back to

1028
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
are you really focused on protecting

1029
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
your users and aligning the business

1030
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,640
outcomes that's at the end of the day

1031
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,960
that's that's what it is all right so to

1032
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
the second point of speaking the

1033
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,880
language that needs to be

1034
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,560
spoken

1035
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,599
my famous line with this is

1036
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,160
if you are a security leader

1037
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,720
you cannot speak to your cfo who's

1038
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
listening in dollars and cents

1039
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,119
in terms of bits and bytes you will

1040
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,119
never be able to communicate you will

1041
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,640
never get buy-in

1042
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,480
it'll be hard to get funding

1043
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,800
so you have to speak according to who

1044
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,160
you're speaking to in the language of

1045
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,240
the listener critically important and

1046
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,800
that's your users as well so if a user

1047
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,320
says well

1048
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,560
why can't i do this on my computer

1049
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,839
you can't say

1050
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,440
well because if you aggravate the flux

1051
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,960
capacitor then we're just going to have

1052
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
to go back to the drawing board and

1053
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,359
we're going to have to deploy this and

1054
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,880
do that it's going to take weeks and

1055
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,040
like they don't care about that all they

1056
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
want to do is finish their powerpoint

1057
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,240
presentation so they can get back to

1058
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,480
their kitty videos and so we have to

1059
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,040
explain to them their role in protecting

1060
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
the business it's our responsibility to

1061
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
make sure that security and protection

1062
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,440
of our organizations is in the dna

1063
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,160
literally in the dna of of our users and

1064
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,520
so that's what i mean speak the language

1065
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,839
that needs to be spoken it's our job to

1066
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,560
make sure everyone is picking up

1067
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,400
what we're putting down or we're not

1068
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,599
going to be able to move our

1069
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,400
organizations or this industry forward

1070
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
and the last point remain focused on the

1071
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,040
desired outcome now this ties back to

1072
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,800
the the first one begin with the end in

1073
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,040
mind we know the path we're going down

1074
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,200
don't get lost on that path

1075
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,720
have you ever

1076
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,599
said i want to take a vacation

1077
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,680
i want to go to miami

1078
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,520
i'm going to sit on the beach

1079
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,480
have a few drinks and just relax

1080
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,079
then you open up your laptop and you

1081
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,839
start looking at flights and you start

1082
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,599
looking at hotels and you start looking

1083
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,280
at rental cars

1084
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,880
and you go on vacation in colorado

1085
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,240
and you're skiing

1086
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,560
it's you and 15 friends

1087
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
this is not what you had in mind but you

1088
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,839
got wrapped around the axle in the

1089
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,920
details and you ended up somewhere that

1090
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,400
you did not originally intend

1091
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,720
and that happens a lot of times in our

1092
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,760
programs as well and the big one i like

1093
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,839
to talk about here

1094
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,240
and that's going to get us to to process

1095
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,200
where we need to focus on outcomes and

1096
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,480
that is literally how we are managing

1097
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,440
our cybersecurity programs what is the

1098
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,960
point of that

1099
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,320
our goal

1100
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,960
in all things is to reduce

1101
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,480
organizational

1102
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040
cyber risk and i say cyber risk

1103
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,880
specifically right because if we're

1104
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,160
focusing on the threats in our

1105
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,760
environments if we're focusing on our

1106
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,000
users we have to say cyber risk or

1107
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,520
because if you just say risk it just

1108
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,960
blows up now we got to talk about

1109
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,720
compliance and we have to talk about

1110
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,000
reputation we have to talk about all

1111
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,920
these things so we stay focused on cyber

1112
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,280
risk okay

1113
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,400
making sure that we're leveraging the

1114
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,520
right processes and programs and

1115
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,720
management capabilities to get the job

1116
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,640
done and so

1117
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,520
the goal here is actually

1118
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,040
from it's a combination of the

1119
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,760
definition from isc squared on what risk

1120
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,680
management is with a little something

1121
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
tossed in that i'll tell you about in a

1122
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,280
second so the goal

1123
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040
is a cost-effective approach to cyber

1124
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,560
risk management that enables security

1125
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,119
teams to quantify and measure cyber risk

1126
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,040
and risk reducing terms

1127
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,720
so yesterday someone in the audience

1128
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
asked the keynote said hey i have to

1129
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
start presenting to my board and i don't

1130
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,400
know what to what to show them whether

1131
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,640
you recommend i start and i thought the

1132
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,079
answer was spot on it was first off do

1133
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,119
not report to your board in terms of

1134
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,359
technology metrics don't say we're

1135
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,599
deploying this endpoint and we've got

1136
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,560
700 out of 1 000 endpoints deployed the

1137
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,400
board's going to say

1138
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,760
okay so what

1139
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,920
right so we have to make sure that we we

1140
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
are ticking are articulating the

1141
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,839
appropriate information and gartner

1142
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,400
released a report recently on the top

1143
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,839
security

1144
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,480
trends of 2021 and one of the things on

1145
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,720
that list was cyber security savvy

1146
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,760
boards

1147
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,280
which does not mean our boards are going

1148
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,119
out and getting certifications in cyber

1149
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,520
security degrees but they are adding

1150
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,800
expertise

1151
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,560
in cyber security to the board and the

1152
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,720
way that they want cyber security

1153
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,960
program effectiveness communicated is in

1154
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,839
risk reducing terms so if we're not

1155
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,440
actually reducing risk in our

1156
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,640
environments

1157
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,599
we're not going to be able to

1158
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,760
communicate that to our boards and where

1159
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,240
i'm going with this in terms of process

1160
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,720
and focusing on outcomes there's a great

1161
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,960
debate in the best approach to cyber

1162
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
security management or risk management

1163
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,040
and the two most debated are the

1164
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,800
maturity-based approach and the

1165
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,040
risk-based approach compliance-based is

1166
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,560
another approach but i think that one is

1167
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
a little less

1168
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,160
convoluted or brought into the argument

1169
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,000
because it's clear right what that what

1170
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,079
that's intended to do but if you think

1171
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,880
about it think about all three of them

1172
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,160
being compliant does not mean i'm secure

1173
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,400
being secure or reducing my risk does

1174
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
not mean i'm compliant

1175
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,680
okay

1176
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,079
and being mature doesn't mean i'm doing

1177
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,119
any of them

1178
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,680
now you may be regulated to

1179
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,359
have to demonstrate your maturity and

1180
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,440
that's fine if that's your outcome know

1181
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,200
that that is your outcome and align your

1182
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,680
program to that but if it's reducing

1183
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,480
risk don't chase maturity don't chase

1184
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,800
compliance quantify the risk in your

1185
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
environment establish your baseline

1186
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,359
establish your kpis and then build a

1187
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,359
program that allows you to articulate

1188
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,720
the reduction of that risk over time

1189
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,000
i could talk about i could have talked

1190
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
about this for an hour because i think

1191
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,359
as an industry we're getting it very

1192
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,720
wrong and it's not us it's just that

1193
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,800
in an industry where things are changing

1194
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
every day how can you possibly have

1195
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,079
enough data to make the right decisions

1196
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,240
all the time right so we just have to

1197
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
get to something that

1198
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
makes us comfortable based on our

1199
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,839
understanding of our environment the

1200
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,160
threats that our environments face what

1201
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,560
our business priorities are and what the

1202
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,440
risk profile of our organization is and

1203
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
that's our organization's risk appetite

1204
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,079
and risk tolerance and we have to build

1205
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,800
a program around those things the

1206
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,560
challenge with this is every

1207
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,640
organization has different priorities

1208
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,040
every organization has different uh

1209
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,119
resources available to them some are

1210
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,200
endless some are limited

1211
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,440
some are kind of sad and we have to work

1212
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,119
through those things right so there's

1213
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,359
it's difficult to standardize on what we

1214
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,520
should all be doing and that's why back

1215
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,280
to to my last point of communication we

1216
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,599
have to over communicate and remain

1217
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,839
focused on the outcomes why does the why

1218
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,760
does our security team exist what are we

1219
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
here to do are we actually doing those

1220
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,040
things or are we just getting wrapped

1221
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,319
around the axle with things that are

1222
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,839
distracting us

1223
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
technology

1224
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,280
this one

1225
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,880
well let me talk about what's on the

1226
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,480
slide first before i get distracted and

1227
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,640
start rambling so if you've not seen

1228
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,400
this slide this is momentum cyber's

1229
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,480
cyberscape and what they do is they take

1230
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,240
all the vendors and they put them in

1231
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,119
categories so we have this view of all

1232
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,880
the security vendors that we can choose

1233
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,760
from and this is tools this is service

1234
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,560
providers all these things now

1235
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,319
if i'm a cso

1236
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,560
or if i'm a vp of i.t or director of

1237
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,960
security and you give me this thing

1238
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,400
i'm going to look at you and say it

1239
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,040
looks like rsa or black hat threw up on

1240
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,880
a piece of paper what am i supposed to

1241
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,599
do with this but that is a problem

1242
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,200
that we have in this industry and i will

1243
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,720
we don't have to delete this i'll go on

1244
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,400
record saying this i've actually become

1245
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,119
very frustrated with where

1246
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,400
the industry

1247
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,599
has gone again world according to tia it

1248
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,560
feels like it's more marketing

1249
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,640
than reality and it makes it very

1250
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,880
difficult for buyers to understand what

1251
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,560
they should be evaluating how they

1252
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,640
should be evaluating and what's actually

1253
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,800
going to solve problems for them and

1254
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,400
that results in just buying all the

1255
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,960
things to make sure you don't go to work

1256
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,520
and get fired because something blew up

1257
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,160
and i think as vendors we have to take

1258
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,240
on more responsibility of being very

1259
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,160
clear about the problems that we're

1260
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,119
solving for and i feel like a lot of the

1261
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,520
the power of of delivering this

1262
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,800
messaging to to organizations to buyers

1263
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,720
uh to these companies that we are

1264
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,040
supposed to be protecting has been taken

1265
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,119
away from the solutioners

1266
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,040
and been placed more in the hands of

1267
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,200
revenue generators and that is that's

1268
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,800
going to be detrimental it has been

1269
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,960
detrimental to our industry and that's

1270
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,800
why we end up with things that look like

1271
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,200
this so technology

1272
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,520
more tools please

1273
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,960
said no one ever

1274
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,160
so

1275
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,920
let's make sure we're evaluating the

1276
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,680
tools that we have the capabilities of

1277
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,920
the tools that we have are they doing

1278
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,359
what we need them to do

1279
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,440
is it actually doing what i was told it

1280
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,960
was going to do when i purchased it is

1281
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,680
it solving the problem that it needs to

1282
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,240
solve do i need to add more technology

1283
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,200
or can i cover this chat or solve this

1284
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,640
challenge with something that i already

1285
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,640
have

1286
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:34,880
so in

1287
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,319
summary

1288
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,000
as an industry

1289
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,160
we need to step our game up we have to

1290
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,200
be vigilant we have to be strategic we

1291
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,280
have to be smart

1292
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,960
otherwise

1293
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,560
the ghosts in our machines are going to

1294
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,920
own us

1295
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,400
and it'll be

1296
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
game over

1297
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,520
and with that i thank you for your time

1298
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,659
[Applause]

1299
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,079
excellent job i think i love the way

1300
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,319
you took the acceptable approach

1301
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,800
i was going to say i heard it's another

1302
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,200
way to get a sticker

1303
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,319
i was gonna say either i nailed it or

1304
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,000
everybody's asleep with their eyes open

1305
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,560
first of all thank you for your speech

1306
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,160
really enjoyed it and i appreciate your

1307
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,280
time

1308
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,040
and i would like to know what your

1309
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,160
favorite cyber security tool is

1310
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,920
oh man

1311
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,240
you only pick one

1312
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,000
my favorite cyber security tool holy cow

1313
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,680
i might have to get back to you on that

1314
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,839
that's a loaded question

1315
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,359
but i'm gonna say

1316
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,880
everything east entire does because

1317
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,930
[Laughter]

1318
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,960
so in

1319
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,959
those

1320
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,040
yeah i think that the easiest way is to

1321
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,599
take all of the

1322
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,800
really complex terminology that we use

1323
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,839
and figure out user level terminology

1324
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,040
that we can leverage in those

1325
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,720
conversations because for someone in

1326
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,480
accounting right it's very easy to say

1327
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,440
well you have access to financial data

1328
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,760
and if that gets stolen that's very bad

1329
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,520
i think most people will understand that

1330
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,319
right but if we go in saying well you

1331
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,480
know the information that you're you're

1332
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,319
leveraging is stored on a file server

1333
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,640
that's hosted in aws so if you were to

1334
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,160
click on a link that then sent you to a

1335
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,760
malicious server that started well

1336
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,359
they're they're already thinking about

1337
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,280
lunch they're not listening to you

1338
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,079
anymore right so simpler the better and

1339
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,480
what you find is when you connect with

1340
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,400
them they connect with you and when they

1341
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,960
understand they want to know more

1342
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,520
because the the very reason that social

1343
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
engineering is so successful is because

1344
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,680
people by nature want to help

1345
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,839
and so if you enable them and empower

1346
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,559
them to help then they will want to help

1347
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,240
more so we really just have to i don't

1348
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,400
want to say dumb it down because i don't

1349
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
think our users are dumb i just think we

1350
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,319
need to do a better job of speaking

1351
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,920
their language in

1352
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,000
an endpoint yes it's an endpoint because

1353
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,680
that's how we talk about it but it's a

1354
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,240
it's a computer to them you say endpoint

1355
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,680
to someone in accounting they might pick

1356
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,680
up a number two pencil and say this is

1357
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,280
that that we were talking about right so

1358
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,880
we just need to be more aware and if we

1359
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,240
are going to use that language if we

1360
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,920
want to standardize on it at the very

1361
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,480
least educate our users on what we mean

1362
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,720
when we say that

1363
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,400
that's a great point i've been dealing

1364
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,960
with that all my life

1365
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,200
from a single perspective how do we

1366
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,480
maintain communications

1367
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,000
i'm sorry what was that yeah

1368
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,240
so change management has been like

1369
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,839
like

1370
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,599
uh what does that mean like

1371
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,480
it's like

1372
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,800
it's not

1373
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,210
give them a glossary

1374
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,119
[Laughter]

1375
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,280
i mean listen if you're gonna put if

1376
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,839
they're asking for

1377
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,800
technical and then coming back and

1378
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,440
saying i don't understand technical then

1379
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,119
what that says to me is that the

1380
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,680
technical detail is a requirement so it

1381
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,760
needs to be documented but there's also

1382
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
the requirement that they understand it

1383
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,119
so i think i mean glossary is a little

1384
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,440
sarcastic but if they want that type of

1385
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,119
terminology in there if they want you to

1386
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,680
say smb instead of talking through it in

1387
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,000
terms of explaining what it is then yeah

1388
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,839
maybe either put in parentheses what

1389
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,079
that is or here is an accompanying

1390
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,400
document to you know explore all of the

1391
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,720
technical terminology in here and the

1392
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,640
the thing is constant communication

1393
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,040
right if it's here's what you asked for

1394
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,960
no i need something else okay try this

1395
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,160
no i need something else if you feel

1396
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,200
like you're banging your head against

1397
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,800
the wall set up a meeting look let's

1398
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,000
just sit down for an hour and read

1399
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,920
through this so you can tell me where

1400
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,599
i'm missing the mark what you need more

1401
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,599
of what you need less of and that will

1402
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,760
save you so much time and then you can

1403
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,119
go back and say

1404
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,480
well what do you mean you need something

1405
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,400
else you told me you need i do this at

1406
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,079
home you told me this is what you wanted

1407
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,760
this is what i did what are we talking

1408
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,200
about here right so once you've had that

1409
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,359
conversation and established this is how

1410
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,359
we're going to work together then it

1411
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,200
should be less friction for for

1412
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,680
everybody

1413
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,799
until we met

1414
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,540
okay

1415
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,670
[Music]

1416
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,680
this company focuses on phishing

1417
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,760
and specifically stopping phishing

1418
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,319
emails by

1419
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,440
i'm sure the ever elusive inky that

1420
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,880
makes sense for a fishing company

1421
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,040
um

1422
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,319
i've been trying to think how to best

1423
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,680
articulate it i have a background in

1424
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,440
software development and a key thing

1425
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,680
that i've run into is

1426
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,520
when you're developing a product some of

1427
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,280
the first things that kind of get

1428
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,559
de-scoped

1429
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,800
tend to be around cyber security because

1430
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,480
it's not functional based

1431
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,319
and the person who's purchasing it is

1432
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,559
always thinking about

1433
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,240
the functional component sometimes not

1434
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,280
always thinking about cyber security

1435
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,040
how often have you run into where that

1436
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,800
is happening a lot do you see that

1437
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,319
cultural

1438
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,559
shift left mindset meaning

1439
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,440
putting

1440
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,040
and cyber security into the development

1441
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,640
process rather than having a customer

1442
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,720
figure out how to wrap security around

1443
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,839
the product

1444
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,240
yeah it's it's actually quite common and

1445
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,800
that's that's why all the rave around

1446
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,119
security should be part of all processes

1447
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,440
not an afterthought because

1448
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,400
it's much more difficult to go back and

1449
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,720
add cyber security at the end or add

1450
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,280
secure coding at the end of building an

1451
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,119
application and i think it really is a

1452
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,319
matter of

1453
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,400
restructuring the way

1454
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,280
um

1455
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,280
i'll say the deliverables are met right

1456
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,760
when when we are developing applications

1457
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,359
but it's challenging

1458
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,960
because

1459
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,599
software developers are software

1460
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,839
developers not security professionals

1461
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,760
right and security professionals are

1462
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,079
security professionals not software

1463
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,839
developers and that goes back to my

1464
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,400
point that security is not a separate

1465
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,240
silo it is not a separate function it

1466
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,960
needs to be an overlay so imagine if you

1467
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,119
were in an organization where software

1468
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,680
development was a team that partnered

1469
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,559
with

1470
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,720
a specific team in security or a couple

1471
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,480
of individuals in security and you guys

1472
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,079
got to talk through the things that you

1473
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,359
were doing in coding and they were

1474
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,480
helping you with things that you should

1475
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,839
think about and those were things that

1476
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,599
you could communicate back to the

1477
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,400
customers so it really is a big issue

1478
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,839
industry wide

1479
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,680
i think years from now

1480
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,400
in any individual in it doing any

1481
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,880
function of i.t will have some sort of

1482
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,799
background understanding insecurity in

1483
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,040
the function that they perform but today

1484
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,880
everything is so siloed it is like

1485
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,480
taking a bunch of legos and putting them

1486
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,960
together and deciding when to do it so

1487
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,839
your problem is not uncommon

1488
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,440
