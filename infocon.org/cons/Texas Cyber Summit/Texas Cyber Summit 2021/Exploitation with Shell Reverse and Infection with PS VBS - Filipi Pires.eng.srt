at singapore since a good international

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,320
company um

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
responsible to provide some pan

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,439
solutions and privilege access

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
management solutions and all those

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
things related to zero trust in my

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,159
security research in these companies and

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,200
my

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
job there is you know to make a research

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,799
about securities related to a moral

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,400
analysis what kind of attacks uh

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
related to exploitations these attackers

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,400
have been using different techniques or

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
different approaches in this uh

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
exploitation that attacker have been

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,799
used and i'm advocate of the hacking is

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,280
not a crime very no product here in us

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
and in the europe and i'm advocating

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
from brazil here and this project is

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
awesome for me and um because the idea

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,320
of this probably need to talk about the

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
mindset about the future about the life

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
cycle because hak is really not a crime

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
right so you can find many information

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,159
about that in the website and if you

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
have time you can explain more about

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,479
that another day right so i'm a part of

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,479
the coordinator team or the staff team

57
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,920
of the deaf home groups here in sao

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
paulo and by the way i'm talking from

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
brazil now some people hearing my small

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
walls of my balcony as you can see here

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
my good vision i like this vision by the

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
way and i'm struggle of the hacker

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
security it's a brazilian company and

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,239
i'm instructor of the mar analysis

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
course there and i'm structured

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,959
and right and reviewer in this three

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,400
magazine and by the way i have the

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
course of the malware attacks um

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,840
with the strategy with the keychain

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
inventors magazine right so just

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
informations about me if you'd like to

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,120
see more information you can find in my

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,239
social medias okay so this is our agenda

74
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
during this day so first of all i'd like

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
to put all those people in the same page

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
basically to explain more about what is

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,840
thread so change your mind i would like

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,760
to provoke you about this thing and some

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
responsible disclosure because i will

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,000
talk about the crowd strike and attack

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,879
actions api manipulations in box using

82
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
by the microsoft using the

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,519
microsoft evolves right so the through

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,519
process actually any in the infection

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,080
process process in the end and the

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,599
question the end of this presentation

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,400
right so just to be clear my idea here

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
is not to

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
give you what the best solution that you

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
can use in your

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,599
atr or your antivirus solutions no that

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,599
my idea is not to explain that just to

93
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,599
explain how you can use

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,480
your creative mind in different

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
ways or a different efficient detection

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
tests because

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,519
when you need to to test some product in

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,920
your environment for example when you

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,280
test using some poc pro of concept

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,319
usually

101
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
it makes sense for me because

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
how you can prove that this solution is

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
it's really efficient for your

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
environment you need to receive some

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,439
attacks during the poc but it's not make

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
sense because it's difficult you don't

107
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,360
know if you are receiving some attacks

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,239
or not so because of of these it's

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,280
important you create your kind of tests

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,000
to test to practice these steps with

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,760
performing these tests in different

112
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
solutions not only how to track but you

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,599
can basically for example in cyber

114
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
reason trying micro or cymaticy or and

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,760
not someone you know it's not a

116
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,839
different name as i think it's a

117
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,199
broadcom right and a mcafee or kaspersky

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,600
or another you know solution that you

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
can imagine okay so that's my idea just

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,600
to clarify okay so what is exactly a

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
thread this is the main topic here just

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,040
to put all those people in the same page

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
it's not my definition it's the

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
definitions according this is okay so

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
thread is defined as a quotation called

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,919
an incident may cause arms in the system

127
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,360
or organizations okay so i mean it's all

128
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,960
usually is that it's related to a

129
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
software attacks because

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
this software can be you know exploited

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,320
or used in some hour to explore the

132
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
bigger machine but in the end of the day

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
they will exploit some systems and

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
probably the system has software so

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
maybe if the threat is related to a type

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,199
of intellectual property so when you are

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,680
a company responsible to provide to

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
create some product and probably you

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,360
have some intellectual property of this

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,919
product okay so the death of this

141
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
intellectual property is it it is a

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,720
threat okay i didn't did that because of

143
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,919
this many companies now um

144
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,160
are applying the zebra test concept

145
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,199
using in

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,680
identity access management and privilege

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
access management because the identity

148
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,120
of the company is pretty pretty

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,080
important right and sabotage it's

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
another different threat okay because

151
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
probably when you expose some

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,440
informations in the internet so maybe

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
it's from the attacker or maybe it's a

154
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
civil page from the you know some

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
malicious guy the red hacker and

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
information distortion for example all

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,039
the information security threats okay so

158
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
just to put all those people in the same

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,720
page a lot of people another point is

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,639
when you need to as a good something

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,639
related to omar analyst the first idea

162
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,479
is to need to identify

163
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,919
the artifact because we don't know if

164
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,120
the money shows not you have the

165
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
artifacts this is the important is the

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,600
identification step so you can see it is

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
malware malicious software or maldoc

168
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,319
just to a simple explanation okay and

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
after that you can define what the best

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
methodology to apply in these analysis

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,039
if you use the statistic analysis or

172
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,360
dynamic analysis of course you need to

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
study more deeply about

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,919
each one of this methodology that you

175
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
can apply in this analysis because you

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
can using tools to help your comments

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,840
and different

178
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
ways okay and my suggestion and you

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
create a report no matter

180
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,199
the action or task or activity you

181
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
execute but it's important you prepare a

182
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,479
report because you need to have

183
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,880
something to present in to your manager

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,199
your coordinator because and after that

185
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,880
you can create

186
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
that i call the provision improving

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,720
defenses mechanisms because probably

188
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,039
when you analyze some at the fact in

189
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,400
your environment

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
you can see what is exactly the network

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
or not the network but what exactly the

192
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
path that the attacker using in your

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,039
network for example what kind of bypass

194
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,120
the attacker use in your environment

195
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,960
okay so because of this you can be very

196
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
important you can improve your defenses

197
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,759
mechanism

198
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,840
and of course you can create the cyber

199
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,599
threat intelligence in your environment

200
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,840
because you can build it right you can

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,560
uh

202
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
working better to productively in a

203
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
product practically way okay and of

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
course your wheel is strengthening the

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
cyber resilience because the threats are

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
changing all the time okay this is the

207
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
simple definition so changing your mind

208
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,319
this is my uh

209
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,880
you know my idea to provoke you now to

210
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
changing uh to give a change about this

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
because

212
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
usually when you talk about the stock is

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
cyber trading hunting in the market

214
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
usually talk about the guy

215
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
working in a stocking security operation

216
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,639
center or mania maybe on a support team

217
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
or maybe inside of the blue team but my

218
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
suit now i suggest my idea you know it's

219
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
a bringing storm here uh that you can

220
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
using the hunting

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
more related to a researcher right

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,800
because of course the log is pretty

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
important but how the threads works how

224
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,599
the malware works exactly more deeply

225
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
okay so when you understand this when

226
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
you have in this in your mind you can

227
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
create a different efficient and

228
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
detection testing in the security center

229
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,560
sensors remember this is the main point

230
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,720
here in our conversation in this day

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
okay so freddie hunting is a productive

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,440
approach to cyber defense with a what

233
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,399
a defense's mindset this is my idea talk

234
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,880
about the cyber defense but with the

235
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,360
offensive mind when you use the process

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,640
productively and interactively surging

237
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
through the network to the attack and

238
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
isolate advanced

239
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,640
threat so but to understand about the

240
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,279
advanced procedure thread you need to

241
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,399
understand how the thread is and how the

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,880
binary on the mowers on the kind of

243
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
attacks works and when you understand

244
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
that

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
remember this is the mindset

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,880
about that you need to understand about

247
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
this threat not of course the log is

248
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
important because no logs no crimes you

249
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
know it's a kind of joke but but it's

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
true you need to have the

251
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
the logs to investigate okay but how the

252
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
exactly binary works what kind of tll

253
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,080
you can find inside of the binary

254
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,279
to

255
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
to have the the real track more deeply

256
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,800
inside of the binary this is the mindset

257
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
here this is my idea from this that

258
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
topic when you talk about the hunting

259
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
mower hunting it's more related to a

260
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,720
mower hunt so how you can hunting the

261
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
mower okay what is a hunter it's a

262
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
person right so it's a qualified

263
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
security professional to recognize but

264
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,320
to recognize they need to understand how

265
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
the known threats works and of course

266
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
when the proper professional the

267
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
security professional know how that

268
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
no threats works they can recognize the

269
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,800
unknown threats or unknown behavior okay

270
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
so after that they can isolate and

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,920
disable potential apts the economy of

272
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
their advanced persistent threat okay

273
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,640
it's more advanced using a manual or

274
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
maybe a an intelligence art or

275
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
artificial intelligence based on

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
techniques or different kind of tools to

277
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
using to help you to identify and this

278
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,760
uh kind of techniques and detecting and

279
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
monitoring in the network so oh he can

280
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,839
or this professional

281
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,800
can

282
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
search for a possible internal take a

283
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
look that internal or

284
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
external intruder but nowadays we have

285
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,200
an internal instructor much much time

286
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,640
because

287
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
and of course the pain of the

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,040
the step or not the step it depends on

289
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
the phase of this attack is it happened

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
external when the attacker tried to

291
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,360
explore the perimeter or maybe they are

292
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,519
in the insider of the

293
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
in your environment inside of your

294
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
perimeter right so this professional

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
it's uh have the capability capability

296
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,200
to identify this kind of uh attacks okay

297
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,959
so i'd like to

298
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,560
explain about the two different

299
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
techniques using them our hunting on

300
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,959
ready hunter first of all basically ioc

301
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,120
maybe this is very known in the security

302
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
communities and the security or info

303
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
security market okay and um is an

304
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,920
indicator of compromise it's pretty

305
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,800
no

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
it's but in this case it's always

307
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,000
related to that

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,560
post attack so you already suffering uh

309
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,360
you already suffered the attack okay and

310
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,839
after that you can collect the domain ip

311
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,160
address will link it to this website you

312
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,480
are looking at some phishing or part of

313
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
the some checks and in your or develop

314
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,680
the checks and uh related to some

315
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,639
malware or what kind of email it was

316
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,399
delivered when you have

317
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,639
so some indicators included like a

318
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
suspicious on on

319
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,399
or no hostile domain or ips suspections

320
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,320
or maybe a signatures to detect the

321
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
suspect suspected or no hostile data

322
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
it's pretty important such as antivirus

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,480
or ideas signatures but as you can see

324
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
here usually it's related to them post

325
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,320
attack okay or data related to a

326
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
potential exploitation of a

327
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
vulnerability exploit like as

328
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
you know like

329
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,639
related to some cve ig okay that you

330
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
have that you can find or it's known

331
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,519
by my tree and and

332
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
another indicator is that using that

333
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
some techniques and techniques and

334
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
procedures associated with with a

335
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,920
suspicious or no host to events

336
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,519
uh or such some underwriter tools like a

337
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
mimikats for example or

338
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,200
you know when you see this in your

339
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
environment this tool is including in

340
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,120
your environment but you don't have any

341
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,839
offensive uh security team in your

342
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
environment if you see here and in your

343
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
environment or here but when you see in

344
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
your environment maybe you need to see

345
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
because probably you are suffering some

346
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,560
uh exploitation or some people or some

347
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,800
intruder to try to collect the

348
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,480
credentials in your environment okay so

349
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
this is the technique based on ioc

350
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,079
and

351
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,600
and you have the malware information

352
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,120
centering practical form the current is

353
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
misp that you have the treaty sharing

354
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
platform it's a free and open source

355
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
software helping information to sharing

356
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
with the community it's pretty nice

357
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,000
because here you can collect and you can

358
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
share with this indicator of the

359
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,240
compromise okay here's the link of the

360
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,959
project probably already know about that

361
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
i've already heard about that and here's

362
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,880
the picture that i this picture is from

363
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,040
google okay so from the internet so no

364
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
worries about that you don't have any uh

365
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,279
pii here or any information about the

366
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,240
customers okay so and it just to show

367
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
you the simple lock here and as you can

368
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,800
see here the event is from lock key

369
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
maybe it's a short letter but it's a

370
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,279
lock key it's kind of rents or any as

371
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
you can see here different events

372
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
different um informations related to

373
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
these some urls and that you can using

374
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,320
this kind of attack so here as you can

375
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,160
see some event informations the the url

376
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,839
here the title of the email so different

377
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
indicators related to this io system

378
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
this is one of these techniques using an

379
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,920
intraday hunting okay and another

380
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
techniques is based on the eoa okay it's

381
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
indicator of attacking solely and

382
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,399
behavior on the focus if they focus on

383
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,880
why it's nice because you can ask

384
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
because it's a focusing behavior the

385
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,399
idea of the eoa is based on the attack

386
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,120
before happened it's a pretty important

387
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,000
understand right because here you can

388
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
using in a practical way before they

389
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,720
happen some attacks in your

390
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,120
organizations okay and based on the

391
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
intention of the attacker okay it's more

392
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,839
technique strategy it's more

393
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,000
looking deeply based on tactics and

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
techniques and procedures the famous

395
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,680
ctps okay

396
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,800
when properly positioned in more mature

397
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,120
intelligence programs so remember and

398
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,279
these are your ways it's more related to

399
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,079
the intelligence and the questions so

400
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
you need to understand more deeply

401
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
because you can see some suspicious

402
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,760
behavior you can investigate to

403
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,120
investigate more before having some

404
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,800
attacks okay some some indicators

405
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,680
include the real behavior okay not

406
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,279
limited on the end point behavior

407
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,120
analysis is a different when you have

408
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
some function function inside of the the

409
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
antivirus you have this behavior

410
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,040
monitoring or intelligence or machine

411
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,360
learning whatever name you prefer use

412
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000
you have dignity point but the real-time

413
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,839
behavior like

414
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,480
how you can see the windows inventory

415
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,600
right so uh how you can monitoring this

416
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
different behavior how you can

417
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
set some tags in your environment to see

418
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,759
these suspicious behavior okay another

419
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
is the code execution method that data

420
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,399
or some

421
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,120
and then again some dll or dynamic

422
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
linked libraries

423
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
called so how you can see the sequence

424
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
of the events

425
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,519
all the actions you can find or how you

426
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
can see this kind of action in your

427
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,560
environment right species and user

428
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,199
behavior in relationship to the digital

429
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,399
thread so

430
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,800
some different behaviors based on some

431
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,240
users uh or maybe some accesses by these

432
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
users in unknown a work time for example

433
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
right so how we can see and

434
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,000
remember why it's based on the why why

435
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,959
these users are working at this in this

436
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,920
way okay and the ttp statistics and

437
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,079
techniques and procedures procedures are

438
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,399
linked to the hostile oscillator such as

439
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
a mower used in some attacks and

440
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,680
persistent and health components as you

441
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
can see some

442
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
different components in your i don't

443
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,399
know

444
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,279
windows task manager for example using

445
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,679
in some attacks and let's see some

446
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
indicators i would like to

447
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
give you 10 example okay some internal

448
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
hosts with a bad destination it's pretty

449
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,959
common to see internal holes to try

450
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,439
connecting in a bad destinations about

451
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
different countries that you don't have

452
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,799
any business uh with this country so why

453
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,599
that happened this okay so internal was

454
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
with the no standard ports it's very

455
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,919
common too

456
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,480
because again so why the these internal

457
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,760
hosts are

458
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
requesting some access in an unknown

459
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,799
known standard ports and the public

460
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,320
server and dmz

461
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,799
to internal host so i mean to try

462
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,480
connecting internal holds if you don't

463
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,360
have any services or processing and

464
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,799
these different uh servers okay

465
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,440
of our detection it's a no it's not

466
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,400
common

467
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
time

468
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
for example you don't have any

469
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,640
jobs at one am

470
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,760
and why you have you can find

471
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
many tentative of the attacking this

472
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
exactly time okay network is kind of

473
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
inviting kind of hopes if you don't have

474
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,039
any security offensive teams okay

475
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,600
multiple alarms events for a single host

476
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,080
it's very nice here i have some example

477
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,640
i can explain in another time with you

478
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,000
but you have one single host but it's

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
receiving or having many different

480
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,520
alarms

481
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
the system is reinfected with the mower

482
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,120
so what kind of also why these systems

483
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,720
are infected

484
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,880
in different models it's the same hour

485
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
different techniques

486
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,360
why remember based on behavior

487
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,640
even you

488
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,280
you can block it pay attention this even

489
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,039
you can block at the access it's not a

490
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
problem but you can block it you you

491
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
maybe you are thinking okay but i'm

492
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,640
blocking the identity so why not

493
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,919
investigate because you need to ask why

494
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,400
this same system are trying to be

495
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,520
infected by someone so why even you were

496
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,080
blocked but you need remember when you

497
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
talk about that advanced versus

498
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
translating not a short short time

499
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,440
attack that's a long time attack so the

500
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,840
attacker can or the threat actor will

501
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
try to in fact infect you a long time so

502
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
because of this we need to understand

503
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
and you need to ask yourself about the

504
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,600
why okay

505
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,679
so multiple logins from different

506
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,679
regions it says it's a simple question

507
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,200
right it's a simple point here because

508
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
we want one person it's impossible to

509
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,880
make a multiple logins at different

510
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,000
regions okay nintendo has to use a much

511
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,280
uh smtp protocols right so that you have

512
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,160
one smtp server or maybe you have more

513
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,559
than one but a different internal host

514
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,320
to try connect you know

515
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,720
internal hosts using many queries to

516
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
external any internal dns when you have

517
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,720
someone through or two dns so why you

518
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,799
are having internal hosts to try

519
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,600
connector to try using another external

520
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,280
dns so pay attention this and okay so

521
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
first of all i will explain

522
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
the idea of the threads and the hunting

523
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
to suggest to some something related to

524
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,280
a change your mind why i do that because

525
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
this is the mindset that i'm using when

526
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
i execute these tasks remember again i

527
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
will i will uh clarify one more time

528
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,919
it's not to explain what the best

529
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,760
solution is strike yes you know sofas or

530
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,400
or silence or whatever solution you have

531
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,799
a microsoft no not my idea here during

532
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
these presentations i made these tests

533
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,240
in different sensors like count strike

534
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
like a surface like a cyber reason

535
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
right so and i

536
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,880
i realized i i realized i execute this

537
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,120
task and i present the report for all

538
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,520
those vendors i just would like to

539
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,480
explain in this process and this

540
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,559
company called crowdstrike so this is

541
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,280
the response responsible uh disclosure

542
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
about this so i reported this in this

543
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
the first reporter i presented to the

544
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
code strike at october 220 as you can

545
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
see here the data and the time

546
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
and by the way

547
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,400
the email as uh i

548
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,240
i wrote in portuguese because i reported

549
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,080
for the portuguese team in that time

550
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,120
okay so i explained so sorry uh for the

551
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,760
time because it's too late how we we

552
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,840
talked in our conversation our call

553
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,760
because i called to the

554
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,880
the manager okay i started this week to

555
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,919
do some testing about the detection and

556
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,000
efficient test with the called strike

557
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
right it's a poc as you can see here but

558
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,640
i explained to the uh

559
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,880
to the construct team that i do execute

560
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,760
some efficient that's eci bypass

561
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
the solution i would prepare a report

562
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
and i you submitted this report to the

563
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,080
company okay so i'm right here i'm

564
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
saying i'm sending two reports in

565
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,919
english uh

566
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,240
right by me and and the equipped in the

567
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,320
team from the zoo security labs this is

568
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,280
my previous job okay and

569
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,600
that we execute these tests

570
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,280
so some important information the first

571
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
is that

572
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,120
we the solution not block at the same

573
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
hour called vba using the vbs that we

574
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,679
will show you here during the

575
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,559
presentation and the second test we can

576
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
uh

577
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,360
in the second test we can have another

578
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,120
infection using another mower in

579
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,679
msa

580
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,760
from the mower bazar report i mean by

581
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,159
using two different reports here and the

582
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,480
zoo testing it's a github

583
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
repository with many mowers that you can

584
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
find there and the marbles are another

585
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,679
search of them

586
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,760
all those my tests is in my course i

587
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,679
always use in the real malware because

588
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,080
in this way you can really

589
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,200
your skill and you can try and you can

590
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,520
prove if this solution is efficient or

591
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
not okay so here's some impact that i

592
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,039
explained to the count strike not

593
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,000
detected by signature base and depend

594
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,919
dependence of the real-time engine

595
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
engines so for my side it's dangerous

596
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,320
because you need to test

597
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
the mower and in the same time the

598
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,559
energy is work it works if the engine

599
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,240
doesn't work so what happened you would

600
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,159
be in fact there so this is some impact

601
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,120
that i explained to the counter strike

602
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,559
and take a look at their answer for the

603
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,720
vendors right we just

604
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,120
received a generic answer on wednesday

605
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,240
and the next day okay our technical team

606
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,400
analyzed the points and we didn't

607
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,640
validate them then as a validated test

608
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
for the solutions

609
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,440
okay you take your conclusion

610
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
and uh this is the printing in

611
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
portuguese the answer so i just

612
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
translate for you and the construct team

613
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,960
send me a some links about the deaths of

614
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
the solutions uh executing by the 30

615
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360
parties and the market market global

616
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,520
okay so here's some reference that

617
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,320
showed me but i explained again okay

618
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,039
i agree about this test but i performed

619
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
my test here in my way i explain all

620
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,679
those steps all those steps i publish

621
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,559
and now after the disclosure time okay

622
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,880
and it's not a validation test okay but

623
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,520
i continue to ins to talk with the team

624
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,039
i open the support case and after

625
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,559
three months that you can see here the

626
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,320
data i received this answer from the

627
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
vendor the final answer felipe i'd like

628
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,880
to thank you for your submission youtube

629

for a full review and modification or

631
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,039
create an additional capabilities in

632
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,440
falcon and falcon should they be

633
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
necessary as you are not a current

634
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,360
customer so here it's making you know

635
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,200
i'm disappointed here in this in this

636
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,720
phrase okay uh it's my just my opinion

637
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
you can just not agree with me no

638
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
worries about that but i i was

639
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,679
disappointed at that time okay i uh as

640
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
you are not a currently customer with

641
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,320
that activity support subscription

642
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
however you can we can't

643
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,760
uh we cannot provide you with any

644
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,480
further information or results

645
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,679
so what can i do in this case so uh they

646
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,600
suggest me to talk with the equip the

647
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
account team but i don't have accounting

648
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,080
because i'm not a class customer i'm i'm

649
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
doing the psd trying to be a new

650
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,039
customer but it has to imagine how the

651
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,880
results in the end of this

652
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,799
tests right and unfortunately we

653
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,400
we don't know we don't we don't know uh

654
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,360
we don't know

655
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
we don't have a um we don't have the

656
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
private solution actually okay so this

657
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,600
is the answer from the vendor so okay

658
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,200
let's talk about the actions of the

659
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,080
attack

660
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
that i performed in this environment

661
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,840
okay so the purpose was a secular

662
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,159
several yen efficient detection tests

663
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,039
again

664
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,120
in our lab environment to protect with

665
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
the any point solution provided by crown

666
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
strike this document brings the results

667
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,600
of the defense securities analysis with

668
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,919
the offensive mind remember that this is

669
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,400
the idea here offensive mind using a

670
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
reversal shell techniques to gain the

671
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
access inside the victor machine so this

672
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,720
is the first to its test and after that

673
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,880
to performing a mower in a vbs to

674
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,120
infected the vignero machine through

675
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,600
using some script in a power shell to

676
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
call them our in our environment take a

677
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,480
look that that i'm using many behavior

678
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,799
in my in my

679
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,440
laboratory environment because the the

680
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,880
purpose of the tools exactly works in uh

681
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,600
you know in the real time behavior so i

682
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,760
use a good this in this way so the first

683
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,039
uh

684
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,720
shadow that executes the simple part of

685
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,039
script as you can see here i import this

686
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,120
uh you can check this in the internet i

687
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,000
don't remember exactly uh

688
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,760
directory because i'm not creating

689
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,039
exactly this code i have hearing i saw

690
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,960
it in the internet but i don't remember

691
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,279
exactly uh

692
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,360
where i found this code i just made some

693
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,200
adjustment and the code is some

694
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,360
parameter here but it's not my created

695
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,200
to the in the beginning okay but

696
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
basically it's important of the

697
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,799
the same

698
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,880
i eos and sockets basically these

699
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,640
attacks is open and socket as you can

700
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,919
see here right to connected in this ip

701
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,520
address that's my ip address on the

702
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,919
attacker machine and open this

703
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,279
1717 port as you can see and now you

704
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,320
open this process windows system 32 it's

705
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,960
uh administrator administrator access in

706
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,919
this case so i have all privilege to

707
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,240
access in this case okay so the simple

708
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
shell that i am including this so as you

709
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,720
can see in in there as you can imagine

710
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,960
when you have tried to in fact that you

711
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,600
are in the environment so if you have an

712
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,760
antiviral solution should be detected

713
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
right because you are an open a socket

714
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
in your environment and it's a

715
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
it's a known behavior used by the

716
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,480
attacker okay so let's explain here the

717
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
first demo that i will explain so first

718
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,720
of all this is my machine and by the way

719
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,799
i record all those tasks because it's

720
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,880
very important to show to the vendor and

721
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,600
always when i execute some testing i try

722
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,080
i know i try recording all those stats

723
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,559
and after that i present you to the

724
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,320
the vendor because i will explain all

725
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,880
those steps so first of all i said here

726
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,960
right now set but i i

727
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,039
i show here my ip address of the bitmap

728
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,000
machine about the the user connected

729
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,240
here and the information about the

730
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
system infos okay this is the first idea

731
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,039
it's a microsoft windows 10 pro it's um

732
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,919
you know it's actually updated solution

733
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,320
here as you can see and all those

734
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,039
informations about this machine okay the

735
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,640
call i called it ready hunting

736
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,399
repository and so on

737
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
second i will

738
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,799
explain about some directory and some

739
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,279
files here let me check here okay i will

740
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,640
delete this

741
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,840
this file here the vbs underscore here i

742
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,600
think i will delete okay yes i will

743
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,399
delete this here because i view after

744
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,240
i'm recording a new transfer after that

745
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,840
as you can see okay i have here the

746
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,480
shell.php php no sorry shell dot python

747
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,600
my script as i mentioned okay but first

748
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,440
i would like to

749
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,320
show you the all those policies applying

750
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,880
this laboratory applying this bitcoin

751
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
machine as i will show you okay so first

752
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,399
of all are you open by the way the

753
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,720
process explorer to show you about the

754
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,760
behavior

755
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,000
about this system operation so how the

756
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,080
system operation works so first of all

757
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,399
this is my machine windows 10 as you can

758
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,120
see

759
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,440
and the whole thing name is already

760
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,480
hunting and you can find here the sensor

761
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,480
version that i am using in this test so

762
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,399
first of all i will go to the preventing

763
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,039
policies to show you about all those

764
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,399
policies that i am applied in this

765
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,279
environment so one important thing is

766
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,120
here is i apply the best practices from

767
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,960
construct so i'm using this process

768
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,720
practice to apply but as you can see

769
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,320
here one hold uh protected by this

770
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,520
policies and this um

771
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,360
this vault is my whole super back so as

772
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
you can see here so all those uh

773
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,960
features is enabled as you can see here

774
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,799
so if you see here take a look it will

775
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,880
cause the video here and take a look at

776
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,799
this when you talk about the cloud

777
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
antivirus malware and here you have the

778
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,440
edward and

779
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,679
kind of mower and as you can see here

780
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,240
you have the detection in an extra

781
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,080
address aggressive

782
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
and then the cloud in tomorrow the same

783
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,559
case extra and aggressive

784
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,399
and if you see here the next generation

785
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,200
antivirus category by cloud machine

786
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,120
cloud machine learning probably based on

787
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,880
this some engine okay

788
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
as you can see here another um the cloud

789
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,080
edge virus and that you can see here

790
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,039
it's totally extra aggressive i mean

791
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,720
it's i

792
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,600
apply it the more aggressive to detect

793
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,440
so i need to have

794
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,159
the

795
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
the logs about some information the next

796
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,080
generation antivirus the same case is

797
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,799
extra aggressive it's totally uh

798
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,960
paranoid right you know paranoid

799
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
applications of the policy as you can

800
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,600
see

801
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,440
in this case it's called strike not

802
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,520
recommending to put in the extra

803
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,760
aggressive y because probably you have a

804
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,279
false positive right but i am trying to

805
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,279
block my tentative

806
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,039
because of this i put in the extra

807
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,519
aggressive and i can talk now as you can

808
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,440
see here the ransomware applications

809
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,240
okay the ransomware behavior take a look

810
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
that they have the answer behavior

811
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
exploit mitigations as you can see here

812
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,600
it's enabled okay exploitation behavior

813
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,399
enabled for all those things

814
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,200
is

815
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,440
the solution is totally enabled okay

816
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,519
and after that i will show you here the

817
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,919
process of the construct running as you

818
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,919
can see here the falcon container and

819
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,080
the focal services two services

820
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,880
responsible to execute the engines

821
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
inside of the victor machine and again

822
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,880
i'm sure i will show you here in the

823
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
process explorer it's a small because

824
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,919
it's a recorder okay but just to show

825
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,000
you about that this is the bigger

826
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
machine so the second point is i will

827
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,039
show you my attacker machine this is my

828
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,679
attacker machine i will open the 70-70

829
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,080
port in one more time and i will

830
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,919
listening in the sport this

831
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,159
communication using a python so we're

832
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,559
using a python simple python script and

833
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,640
i execute this open the process

834
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,399
including a red

835
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,720
in a green color as you can see here and

836
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,399
take a look at the process it's not too

837
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,720
high in a cpu and after that i open

838
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,000
socket and now i gain t-access in the

839
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,399
bitcoin machine as you can see here so i

840
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,559
have here the

841
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,480
informations inside of the speaking

842
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,799
machine i have the control of the

843
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,440
treatment machine so i'm just simple

844
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
like that i execute the finance script

845
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,039
call it and assume some spine script

846
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,240
open a socket using rtcp okay

847
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
again the access in the video machine

848
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,559
but as i show you all those policies uh

849
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,519
is applied as i show you okay and as you

850
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,960
can see

851
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,360
not detect that this simple behavior

852
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
okay and by the way malicious behavior

853
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,399
so

854
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,640
after that i go to the desktop folder

855
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,440
here and i will create a simple uh joke

856
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,080
as i show you here we don't have any

857
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,399
files created here in the desktop and

858
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,320
after that i will create a simple folder

859
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,679
in a folder sample file here and i call

860
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,799
uh

861
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,919
lose dot tax just a simple job okay and

862
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,240
uh as you can see here

863
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,559
and after data is a good this and all

864
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,799
those things is righted in the big no

865
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,399
machine and if you are returning the

866
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,039
victor machine as i will show you here

867
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,679
take a look that i have this file here

868
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,039
and if i minimize here i can see

869
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,320
the

870
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,519
file here so i have a control in my

871
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,960
machine okay so the second test is

872
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,600
api manipulation so i am here in the

873
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,399
victor machine so what kind of i gain

874
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,080
the access using the reversal shot so

875
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,559
the next steps i'm using an apa

876
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,880
manipulation so i would like to call

877
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,200
sam mower or something in some

878
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,200
repository okay so i using this this api

879
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,080
manipulations using a vbs underscore q

880
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,600
dot ps1 so basically this descriptive

881
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,879
power in powershell using uh this api

882
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,040
manipulation by the

883
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,760
mower bazar um repository i don't know

884
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
if you know but i can share the link

885
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
after it's presentations but by the way

886
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,359
are you using

887
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,918
this api to call something and whatever

888
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,480
you call this hash file i will set this

889
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,839
specifier and when i after i

890
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,800
i'm

891
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,320
seeing

892
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,199
uh

893
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,480
what kind of path i have in my victor

894
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,800
machine in this case i have this path

895
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,960
because in the video when i infected a

896
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,359
little machine i found this path i can

897
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,599
using this to download my vbs underscore

898
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,399
q and i can using the two different

899
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,639
invoke requests okay just to explain

900
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,040
about the api manipulation but

901
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,159
before is a good api manipulation i you

902
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,240
need to um

903
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
call this

904
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
powershell because this powershell is

905
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,240
not in the victron machine it is my

906
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,160
attacker machine so i need to download i

907
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,880
need to transfer this file from

908
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,599
my attack machine to the victor machine

909
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,440
so this is what i will explain this the

910
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,240
second video okay so i have the access

911
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
in this

912
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,079
machine as i show you here so the next

913
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,560
step is i need to transfer this power

914
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,920
shell in my my attacker machining to

915
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
the victor machine so this is i will

916
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,400
open the integral to to putting my

917
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,920
um

918
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,520
web my my

919
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,040
my machine in the internet and i'm i'm a

920
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,680
simulator kind of commanding controller

921
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,920
here in this case because i open this

922
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,960
service right so i i open this and i

923
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,599
forward my local machine into this any

924
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,160
grog website right so based on where

925
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
based on the us and when i execute the

926
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,119
stats i am in the brazilian by the way

927
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,839
so i will open my services and put in

928
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,320
the us remember my environment

929
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,000
is and is one is in in brazil and when i

930
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,640
perform this test so

931
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,480
i will here executable check just about

932
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
the files and file as you can see here

933
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,800
this is the folder this is the file dbs

934
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,359
underscore q dot power shell has

935
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,640
animation okay and uh using api

936
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,520
manipulation so i will pass here as i

937
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,320
explain you and this is the url that i

938
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,839
can

939
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,480
move my

940
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
malicious powershell malicious

941
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,119
powershell using api manipulations to

942
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
send something remember in the script i

943
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,160
will send something using this

944
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,079
powershell remember this

945
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,359
and so the next steps i need to call

946
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,000
this i need to call this folder i need

947
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,880
to call this file okay so

948
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,119
i will call the powershell because this

949
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,000
is a true process in the big machine are

950
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,800
you using a vodka invoke weather request

951
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,520
but i will explain the next demo okay

952
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,640
but

953
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,680
i will using this to invoke

954
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,960
this url this url using my

955
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,359
commanding controller server okay based

956
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,960
on beware based on us so that's

957
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,200
the second step step i will

958
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,359
access my commonly controller in us as

959
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,480
you can see here and i will download

960
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
my file

961
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,119
through

962
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,800
the figure machine and as you can see

963
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,599
here

964
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,839
you have the get access and as you can

965
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,040
see here you have the request in my any

966
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,160
krog server okay so

967
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,680
in this moment i have here my

968
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,320
file inside of the bitcoin machine as

969
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,920
you can see here so now i have my

970
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,160
powershell inside of the video machine

971
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,960
but remember i manipulate

972
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,520
requests inside of the victor machine

973
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,400
okay so the next step is using evox as i

974
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,320
using here the web request so that let

975
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,560
me explain about the code one more time

976
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,119
so again this is using the api

977
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,880
remember this api or this power shell

978
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,040
i will call this

979
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,160
file this file is a vbs malicious okay

980
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,040
and are you using the import web request

981
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,960
to execute this request something in

982
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,280
some places inside of this

983
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,359
machine as i used

984
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,720
in this

985
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,560
before in this another demo to transfer

986
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,800
my malicious code in my cc are using

987
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,440
this invoke request okay and the second

988
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,160
invoke using the invoke expression to

989
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,119
call the target folder and to set the

990
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
hash file because this file that i will

991
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,920
download i you need to invoke this i

992
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,720
need to

993
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,280
execute this file in the victor machine

994
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,560
automatically right so i use a good this

995
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,520
and i call the file setting the vbs file

996
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,359
because i know that's this file with the

997
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,760
vbs file okay so this is the second

998
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,160
expression okay so let me explain the

999
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,880
infection process basic based on this

1000
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,680
malware so this model has a code okay if

1001
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,280
you try to copy this code and pass in in

1002
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,640
doc text

1003
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
when you have some antivirus solutions

1004
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,480
based on and the signatures

1005
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,040
always usually always antivirus wheel

1006
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,240
detected has a mower why because this

1007
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,800
vbs is known as a mower in more than 50

1008
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,839
engines

1009
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,920
by the rules total remember this

1010
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,480
information i can share with you you can

1011
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
check this hash and you can put this

1012
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,560
hash in the mail in heroes total and you

1013
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
can check this is a malicious model it's

1014
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,119
not a new attack it's an old attack it's

1015
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,000
a mower okay based on vbs

1016
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,599
and take a look at this code it's pretty

1017
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,440
interesting as you can see the create

1018
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,560
extension so the mower view changing the

1019
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,119
stations in the victim machine type x

1020
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,960
station they will

1021
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,599
change all those extensions in dockax in

1022
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,240
dock xls and the mp3 and text and jota

1023
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,200
pack

1024
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,920
and another is attacked so as you can

1025
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,839
see the view is a good this action

1026
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,400
malicious action the very similar

1027
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
behavior that enhancer have

1028
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,880
right so you can agree with me

1029
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,359
and they will using created this object

1030
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,640
using in

1031
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,319
and basically and windows script

1032
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,119
process right so using the vbs scripting

1033
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,720
in the victor machine okay so this is

1034
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,280
the simple code model so let's see about

1035
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,880
this attack

1036
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,599
so

1037
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,960
remember

1038
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,359
i have my file now my dps in the bigger

1039
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,599
machine i'm using a powershell now to

1040
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,319
execute this powershell in the bigger

1041
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,280
machine

1042
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,240
but

1043
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,040
first of all you put the wbbs and i

1044
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,599
somehow happen why because i need to set

1045
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,880
here the

1046
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,359
dock and um

1047
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,200
and they slash here to execute the

1048
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,440
powershell because of this disabled

1049
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,119
and um i will pass i will type again so

1050
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,200
powershell i will call the powershell as

1051
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,240
you can see and docslash and after that

1052
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
i will call you i'll call my malicious

1053
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,560
folder and take a look at this

1054
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,000
the

1055
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,160
the powershell it's running one more

1056
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,800
time in the weaker machine so and after

1057
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,040
that i will call again the api as i

1058
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,680
mentioned i will download this hash is

1059
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,240
malicious this is the malware okay and

1060
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,560
after that has you can see that you have

1061
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,280
the invoke expression do the malware

1062
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,160
view is a good automatically

1063
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,640
inside of the machine so as you can see

1064
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,599
here take a look at this the wp script

1065
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,560
running in the vipre machine so the

1066
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,680
solution

1067
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,119
didn't block it at this moment now so as

1068
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,119
you can see the windows scripts are

1069
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,040
running and take a look at this the

1070
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,319
pd here and take a look here the

1071
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,040
the informations in the video machine so

1072
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,920
the cpu take a look this it's high cpu

1073
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,640
it's growing the cpu as you can see here

1074
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,440
starting in 49 but now as you can see

1075
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,040
here in 70

1076
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,720
76 uh whether 67 sorry for that and as

1077
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,760
you can see you have the high cpu if you

1078
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,920
see here in the big machine take a look

1079
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,000
that what happened here in the cpu

1080
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,040
in my

1081
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,119
process running the cpu is too high it's

1082
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,000
growing and if i try to open

1083
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,480
another task manager as you can see here

1084
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,000
it's not possible why because the cpu is

1085
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,800
too high in this case and i tried to

1086
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,680
open the task manager to show you how to

1087
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
the windows descriptive but impossible

1088
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,920
to open because the cpu is too high

1089
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,760
something are happening in the

1090
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,480
background of this uh in this bitcoin

1091
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,000
machine as you can see here so let's see

1092
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,240
what happened so let me go to the more

1093
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,200
in the end of this presentations and

1094
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,160
just to show you here

1095
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,160
okay i am no before let me go here let

1096
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,040
me return here just to show you okay i

1097
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
will show you about the connections in

1098
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,680
this victor machine and i will return

1099
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,119
here

1100
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,359
and take a look at this all those files

1101
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,400
are changing to the vds remember that we

1102
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,800
have a different files here so if i show

1103
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,680
you remember all those files is in in

1104
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,280
powershell let me pause here okay

1105
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,839
you have here payload.text

1106
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,119
binary in powershell you have here in a

1107
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,359
tor.c in the in the c programming

1108
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,440
language in a python so we have here

1109
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
individual machine in different files

1110
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,200
right so aviodox vbs and after this

1111
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,160
infection as i show you here all those

1112
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,400
files that were changed by dot dps

1113
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,720
remember in the modern code all those

1114
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,240
exchanging is will be changed

1115
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,680
to doc dbs in which we saw in the code

1116
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,319
okay so if you return here in our

1117
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,720
desktop one more time remember the file

1118
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,200
that i created take a look at this

1119
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,599
doctex doc vbs so our files are changed

1120
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,079
by vbs the infections

1121
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,680
infection happened

1122
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,839
the customer it was in fact that as you

1123
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,599
can see here if i try type take a look

1124
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,720
at this i don't have any other

1125
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,200
information inside that okay

1126
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,079
so if i see here

1127
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,000
the files are infected if i try to see

1128
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,839
about the folders take a look at this

1129
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,920
all those folders all those files that i

1130
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,960
have inside of the machine my tools in

1131
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
this is internals take a look at this

1132
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,520
all those files are changed the machine

1133
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,880
is totally infected as you can see here

1134
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,599
so

1135
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,079
the solution didn't detect that so

1136
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,760
and after that i reported all those

1137
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,000
informations to the vendor but

1138
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,040
unfortunately i don't have any

1139
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,520
informations related to this so i

1140
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,440
execute this and i finish my

1141
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,280
presentations i think so here's some

1142
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,200
