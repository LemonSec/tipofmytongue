1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
into this talk street cred today we're

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,360
looking at

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
fixing authentication and improving

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,320
trust and authentication uh shifting

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,120
from passwords to passwordless my name

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,679
is wolfgang gorlick i am i'm out of

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,799
michigan

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,119
i'm an advisory ceo i've worked in

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,640
healthcare i worked in financial

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
services uh and today i am with uh with

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
cisco secure focusing predominantly on

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,119
duo

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,279
i want to take you back right back back

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,760
a long ways long long ways back to the

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
beginning arguably of computer security

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,160
certainly the beginning of the term

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,520
hacker back to mit in the 1960s

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,960
so

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,079
mit the 1960s the password gets invented

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,760
it gets invented on this piece of

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,920
equipment here the 7094. so ibm 7094

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
great machine mit is like look we need

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,239
to secure this we need to make sure that

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
we're protecting our our data or we need

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,559
to make sure that you know we're we're

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
doing time sharing right and and

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,719
allocating resources to students

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
therefore we shall create the password

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,040
not surprisingly this was also

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
the machine where the first password

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,439
breach happened uh so

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,000
right off the bat we were we were in for

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
trouble but one of the things i want to

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,479
point out is

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,080
from the beginning of security we

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
effectively had

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,720
two paths two tactics

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,240
we could make

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,960
it more difficult on the machine

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,080
think about

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
hashing think about password storage

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,640
think about uh

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
various encryption mechanisms things

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
about behavior analytics we could make

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
it harder on the machine

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,320
or we can make it harder on the person

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
and for the longest time that's what

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
we've done it's been this dichotomy do

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,479
we do we have a stronger algorithm or do

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
we require users to have a

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
longer password

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,840
do we have

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
more complex key length or do we require

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
users to have password complexity do we

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,920
salt and pepper or do we rotate

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
passwords you get the idea and arguably

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,640
we've done both of these but

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,719
the pressures of the ladder the

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,200
pressures on the human have oftentimes

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,239
led folks to make their own path and as

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,160
we know

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
you know the workforce that we're trying

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
to protect in the criminals

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,360
they follow

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
two paths through our organization

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,599
the first path

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
the desire path where the criminal or

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
the workforce is going

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
is arguably

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
made more complex

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,879
by

72
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,599
more complex passwords the more we add

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
constraints

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
to the user the more likely the user is

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,239
to ignore security not participate or of

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
course carve their own path which leads

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
to all sorts of problems

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
and at the flip side the adversaries as

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
they move through our network are using

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,040
whatever we make right whatever piece of

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
software we put in place whatever

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
control we put in place

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,200
that's going to be used or misused or

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
abused by the adversaries to get what

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
they want

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
and this is the way it is with passwords

87
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
fundamentally the way it is with

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,200
passwords for the longest time i mean in

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
thinking back maybe not to the 60s but

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,840
how about the 80s in the 1980s

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
when bsd was being created recently uh

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,959
they found some of the original bsd

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,159
systems and they cracked some of the

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,599
passwords

95
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
and two that struck me as being

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,599
particularly clever but probably

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,840
particularly guessable uh was ken

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,239
thompson ken thompson used a chess move

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,400
all right i mean machine packing that

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,599
would be that would be difficult to

101
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,480
guess

102
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,319
a little bit easier to guess would be

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
eric schmidt's

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,799
use of his wife's name at the time wendy

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
that's adorable

106
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,200
but this is what people do right we make

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,599
meaning out of things and in making that

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,000
meaning we subvert the security and

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
whenever we put too much on the users

110
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,760
we all know that puts us in a bad spot

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
so i want to look today at how we can

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
use more of the machines i want to look

113
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,959
today at authentication factors and

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,560
where they're evolving to

115
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,840
i want to talk about where we're going

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
beyond passwords and some use cases and

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
i also want to look at the security we

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
can wrap around this that goes beyond

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,680
traditional authentication

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,918
so let's start with passwords and and

121
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
multi-factor well you know we we know

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
what the problem is with shared secret

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
so that simple shared string that goes

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
all the way back to the 60s well it can

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
be stolen it can be offline cracked

126
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
people can do credential stuffing

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
attacks on it uh it's long been said and

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
i'm not the first to say it that

129
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
today's adversaries don't break in they

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
they log in you get a password from a

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
password dump in and away you go

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,759
so to to compat this of course along

133
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,880
came

134
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
uh multi-factor authentication we're

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
going to go ahead and

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
add a password plus

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
something we have or

138
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,080
[Music]

139
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,960
something we are now

140
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680
one of the interesting aspects of

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
controls and we see this play out again

142
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
and again and again

143
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
is the minute a security control becomes

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
widely used and widely adopted the

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,039
minute that happens

146
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,520
what's next well what's next is the the

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
adversaries

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
work around it they break through it

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
right all controls make for better

150
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,280
criminals

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
so in

152
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,520
this scenario what's been happening is

153
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
well you know people have been doing

154
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
attacks on sms they can do sim swapping

155
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,759
attacks

156
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,720
for very targeted uh we saw this most

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,039
notably recently uh within past couple

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
years with an attack against someone's

159
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
cryptocurrency wallet that cost them

160
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,000
millions of dollars uh they can use ss7

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
attack so if you can get the cell tower

162
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
and you can do something on that level

163
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
we've got a concern

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
one

165
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
one security conference i was at all of

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
a sudden all our phones time zones

167
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,960
shifted

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,639
and every phone thought we were in

169
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,400
shanghai

170
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
and

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,720
it was effectively

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
uh i don't know if it was an ss7 attack

173
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,039
but it was definitely a cell tower

174
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,680
attack that had shifted us all onto this

175
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
rogue

176
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
rogue cell tower and now of course was

177
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
messing with our gps and reading our

178
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
text and everything else great fun if

179
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
you're at a security conference not so

180
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,639
great if you're concerned about

181
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
protecting uh your organizations

182
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
on mobile passcodes we've we've had

183
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,639
duplicate code generation and other

184
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,720
attacks there and now that people are

185
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
using fish we're starting to see proxy

186
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
attacks like uh evil engine x where

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
the user goes i think they're logging

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
into the page they complete the mfa and

189
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
on the back end that is actually logging

190
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,800
in from the adversaries computer and

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,440
using that mfa request to to

192
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,680
access so we have all sorts of attacks

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
like this now of course on the biometric

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
side we're starting to see cloning

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
which isn't entirely surprising i think

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
anyone who's done

197
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
historic biometrics

198
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
remembers how easy it was to trick those

199
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
due to the

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
crossover error rate

201
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
oftentimes being dialed way too low to

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
make it usable i'll give you an example

203
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,759
i had a data center and uh

204
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,639
and

205
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,919
when the sensor went in in the spring

206
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,240
we had a fingerprint sensor to access

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
the building it worked great worked fine

208
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
spring worked summer worked

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
fall and into winter it started working

210
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,599
less and less and less

211
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
and uh and so we called out

212
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
uh the the folks who did it we called

213
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,479
them out said look we need to fix this

214
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,440
we can not get into our data centers

215
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
please address this problem and they did

216
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
and they did and suddenly we could we

217
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
could all again no problem

218
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,759
except

219
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,400
for the fact that we could all log in in

220
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
any way shape or form and there's this

221
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,280
old uh tactic you could use with a gummy

222
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
bear to simulate a fingerprint and so

223
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,960
for a period of time i was logging into

224
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
my data center and holding it up to the

225
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,440
camera until i made my point abundantly

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,479
clear

227
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
that uh maybe we should

228
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,879
have a better mechanism than

229
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
lowering the crossover error rate so we

230
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
can log in with gummy bears right

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
there's there's a lot of historic

232
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
problems with these sensors

233
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
now sensors have gotten significantly

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,280
better and uh anti-fraud techniques have

235
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
been developed and everything else

236
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
but of course we've moved on from from

237
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,360
gummy bears to doing more advanced

238
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,399
things like

239
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,120
the 3d printing fingerprints and there

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
was a a great blog on talos where they

241
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,640
actually did just that cloning people's

242
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
fingerprints doing the 3d printing and

243
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
using them to log into phones and

244
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,720
everything

245
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,200
so is this a concern and i don't even

246
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,760
have a slide on this but if you look at

247
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,640
it

248
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,440
uh

249
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
look up the news there's also a recent

250
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
attack on windows hello that came out

251
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
about six months ago maybe a little bit

252
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
more

253
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
where

254
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,120
they were able to

255
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
you know clone and brute force faces

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
so on the one hand is uh is this

257
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
biometric attacks

258
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
possible yeah sure absolutely um but is

259
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
it likely probably not yet much like we

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
saw

261
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,279
with multi-factor average series weren't

262
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,200
cloning they weren't they weren't sim

263
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
swapping they were doing any of that

264
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,920
sort of stuff

265
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
and mfa until most people were using mfa

266
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,360
much the same way

267
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
i don't think we're going to see any

268
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
widespread attacks

269
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
against biometrics until everyone is

270
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,519
using it

271
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
and one of the nice things about

272
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,839
the biometric factors today

273
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,399
is that

274
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
well you know if someone says my

275
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
password i can't just have a smarter

276
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,920
keyboard that detects

277
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,160
how the password is typed in

278
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
but if someone is

279
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
brute forcing my face you know there's

280
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,760
better improvements that can be made and

281
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,800
the hardware in the camera and the

282
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
lobbiness liveliness an anti-fraud

283
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,000
also if you're using windows hello

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,880
please

285
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
check your cameras and make sure that

286
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,279
you've enabled the anti-fraud features

287
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
in the touch sensors if someone starts

288
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
widely going after

289
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
and spoofing the touch sensors we can do

290
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
liveliness attacks and and change the

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
biometrics there so i i feel good about

292
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
this because

293
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
it puts a lot of pressure on the machine

294
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
and because we've got a lot of avenues

295
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
where we can increase

296
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
the efficacy

297
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
of the machine detection

298
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
so that's where we are with with the

299
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
factor side of things now when we start

300
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,320
thinking about passwordless we start

301
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,279
thinking about passwordless it's really

302
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,240
taking

303
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,959
this weakest factor in removing it

304
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,640
there's more to it and i'm going to i'm

305
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
going to talk a little bit later on in

306
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
this talk about how i i think the term

307
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
passwordless kind of pigeonholes us but

308
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
just for right now let's let's look at

309
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
getting rid of the password long overdue

310
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,920
i've heard that the you know

311
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
uh

312
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
studies show that a typical person in

313
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,079
the workforce has 191 passwords and we

314
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,000
used to say oh yeah i've got sticky

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
notes all over that i'm concerned about

316
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
i'm one blown sticky note away from a

317
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
breach

318
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,120
which

319
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
i i love that i love the idea that my my

320
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,440
entire security is dependent on one

321
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
blown sticky note

322
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
sounds good right it sounds sounds very

323
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
much like a spaghetti western i think

324
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,519
but the reality is at least

325
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880
since i've been doing consulting circa

326
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
uh

327
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
2005 or 15 to

328
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
19

329
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
no one no one's really doing sticky

330
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,120
notes anymore why because you have to

331
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
have a whole wall of sticky notes

332
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079
especially if you're doing unique

333
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,519
passwords right if you're doing unique

334
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,720
191 unique passwords there's no way

335
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,320
that's going to be remembered so what

336
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
people do is they share passwords or

337
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,079
create a very simple pattern that they

338
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,240
can remember

339
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,200
so when we think about

340
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,680
multi-factor authentication

341
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
once we shift to the stronger factors

342
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
things like biometrics

343
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,639
utf things like dual push or

344
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,959
similar push authentication once we

345
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,279
shift to stronger factors

346
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
the question becomes why are we still

347
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
even reliant on the password right

348
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,360
because the password is one of the

349
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,680
weakest factors and the password creates

350
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,519
a lot of usability issues if we just

351
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
remove that password we'd be in a much

352
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,120
better state

353
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,440
so i think in a very real way

354
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,760
passwordless authentication is simply

355
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
using one of these stronger factors

356
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
hopefully reliant on the very strong

357
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
factors knowing that we've got those

358
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,560
additional weaknesses also hopefully

359
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,000
if you think about all the compliance

360
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,360
regulations if you think about the

361
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
history of

362
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,760
of

363
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
standards bodies like nist and whatnot

364
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
compliance regulations like pci and

365
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
whatnot many many places it says today

366
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,959
thou shalt do multi-factor so not only

367
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,440
that do we need to be reliant on the

368
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
stronger factors

369
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,959
we also need to make sure

370
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,959
that we're using

371
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,040
a couple different factors

372
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
to still be in compliance right to

373
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,160
reduce the the risk and and still

374
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
uh meet our regulatory obligations

375
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,959
so passwordless authentication as we

376
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,399
move forward think about it in in this

377
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,320
term and i'll get to the the underlying

378
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
protocols in just a minute

379
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
from a

380
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,160
pki perspective right we can think about

381
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
this as certificates smart cards and

382
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,959
whatnot

383
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,639
uh log in with the smart cart your

384
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
endpoint device to get in

385
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,000
now

386
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,199
this is fantastic if you already have

387
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,959
smart cards deployed this is very useful

388
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,880
in like healthcare environments you see

389
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
it quite frequently to get into systems

390
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
where speed's an issue

391
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
you'll see it in manufacturing

392
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
environments

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
where the the person's badge is also a

394
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,639
smart card so that allows them to get

395
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,560
into their device without having to

396
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,880
worry about a password or without having

397
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,240
to

398
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
to provide a phone or other form of

399
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,839
multi-factor so that

400
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,600
there's some strength to to that

401
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
approach

402
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,079
another approach that's emerging is

403
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,560
phone as a token

404
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
and

405
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,720
in that scenario it's it's again push or

406
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,240
otp sometimes even qr codes and the

407
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
effective idea is is that maybe you

408
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
don't have a smart card or smart card

409
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,399
reader everywhere uh maybe you went to

410
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,240
the pain the past of having to maintain

411
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,079
smart car readers with driver changes

412
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,000
and code breaks and everything

413
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,279
so you want to use a phone or another

414
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,880
similar device this is really good for

415
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
american workforces for white collar

416
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
workforces for non-union workforces uh

417
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
in some areas you know that you may get

418
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
pushback people don't want to use their

419
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,279
phone for

420
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,680
corporate uh corporate use and so on

421
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
now the emerging standards around

422
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,440
passwordless uh are the 502 standards so

423
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,959
502

424
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
um is

425
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,959
or fido as an organization is the same

426
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
organization that brought you utf right

427
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
the universal second factor

428
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,720
and what uh 502 is is a protocol for

429
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
exchanging with targets so websites and

430
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,480
whatnot using a protocol called a web

431
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
authent which does your authentication

432
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,360
to your web apps

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,480
and then

434
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,440
on the

435
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,199
device endpoint

436
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,279
having a protocol that allows you to go

437
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,800
ahead and check your factors that

438
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
protocol is called ctap so this would

439
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,720
work really well with roaming

440
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,120
authenticators like utf this will work

441
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,639
really well with

442
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
um your your biometric side if you want

443
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,800
to unload key material those sort of

444
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,560
things

445
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,639
now i suspect a lot of

446
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,560
a lot of the industry is going to move

447
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,639
in a phyto 502 direction that seems to

448
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,160
be the the trend we're seeing right now

449
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
and then finally the integration of

450
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,440
courses is just biometrics uh i say just

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,199
biometrics that's usually what's used to

452
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,480
log in to your devices so you know we

453
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
all use face id we always touch id we

454
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
all know how that works windows hello

455
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,079
similarly get your new device one of the

456
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
things i want to point out about this

457
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,839
that is a improvement over my data

458
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,720
center uh

459
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,600
you know

460
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,560
fingerprint id back in the day

461
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,199
is that yes we have better sensors yes

462
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,040
we have better hardware however in

463
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
addition to that we also

464
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,759
have the added advantage that the

465
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,639
biometric is on the device itself uh

466
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,000
what that means is that we're not

467
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
collecting biometrics we're not storing

468
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
biometrics

469
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,920
that is really good from a security team

470
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,079
perspective because we don't have toxic

471
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,160
data concerns uh there are certain

472
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
states like illinois comes to mind that

473
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,959
have rules and regs around storing and

474
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,320
using biometrics so we don't have to

475
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
worry about any of that it also is very

476
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,759
useful

477
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,480
from the perspective of

478
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,799
privacy because if people are concerned

479
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,319
about hey wait a minute i don't want to

480
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,319
give you my biometric i don't give you

481
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,559
my fingerprint well you're not right

482
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,400
it's on your device on your phone and

483
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
your control all we're doing is using

484
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
that to get into the endpoint device and

485
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,079
we're using the endpoint device to go

486
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,438
ahead and pass the key material

487
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
so as things move forward

488
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,799
we're going to see a lot of different

489
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,120
ways to do this windows hello is using

490
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
fido to get into web apps it's using

491
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,440
certificate based authentication again

492
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
traditional ad apps

493
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,400
and that is using the tpm to unlock and

494
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,559
exchange key material

495
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,919
so we've got some really interesting

496
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,400
ways to go ahead and

497
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
provide passwordless by reducing the

498
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
factors and moving on to some of these

499
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,039
things now there's a whole bunch of

500
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,640
different things we got to be concerned

501
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,039
about one of them is what happens if you

502
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,919
have multi factors and

503
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,000
of authentication what happens during

504
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
your recovery process we need to

505
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,799
remember that

506
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,320
when we we extend trust that trust it

507
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,559
can only be measured as the weakest

508
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
possible factor to authenticate or the

509
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,280
weakest possible factor to

510
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,160
um

511
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,840
do account recovery so if someone loses

512
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,240
their uh their key and calls the help

513
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
test and the helpdesk resets their

514
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
account gives them a password well now

515
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
what we're really saying is our security

516
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
is only as secure as a telephone call

517
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,200
and a password if account recovery

518
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
is on a trust chain to our email and

519
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,440
when you lose your account you can't log

520
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
in you reset it with your email what

521
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
we're really saying is hey we have some

522
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,400
fantastic factors for normal use but our

523
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
security is only as strong as

524
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
the person's email so we do need to be

525
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,520
very concerned about those downshifting

526
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,760
uh effects when we plan on our security

527
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,080
for this

528
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,799
the other thing to keep in mind is you

529
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,039
know i mentioned 191

530
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,039
passwords

531
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
other surveys and data show that from an

532
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
application perspective a typical

533
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,120
enterprise has over 1400

534
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
so we've got a ton of applications we

535
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,840
got a very

536
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,520
large attack surface

537
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
so one attack across the primary

538
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
application that's covered with

539
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
passwordless is going to be downshifting

540
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
or doing account recovery

541
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,400
another attack across an organization is

542
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
going to be oh you've got

543
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
those applications

544
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
covered awesome we're going to go after

545
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
any unprotected services

546
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,000
we're going to go after any legacy

547
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
protocols

548
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
we saw this

549
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,160
quite frequently used

550
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,320
legacy protocol attacks quite frequently

551
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,280
used

552
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,919
in attacks against azure where you could

553
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,960
still bind to legacy protocols pop imap

554
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
and whatnot

555
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
and uh

556
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
and in doing so bypass mfa altogether

557
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
verify that you have the right password

558
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
do credential stuffing attack get access

559
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
to certain things at certain times

560
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,240
microsoft's been doing a really good job

561
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,000
at hardening this and of course many

562
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
organizations are aware of it and have

563
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,080
turned off legacy protocols all together

564
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
but i think that sets a pattern in the

565
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,960
standard for what we can expect going

566
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,400
forward

567
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
wherever sears gonna attack over 1400

568
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,559
applications they're going to attack the

569
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,559
apps you don't know about the apps that

570
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,639
are legacy the apps are not protected

571
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,159
all right let's talk a little bit about

572
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,559
the use cases

573
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,159
for passwords and passwordless next

574
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,320
obviously the primary use case

575
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,400
that most people are aware of today the

576
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
the consumer use case that drives all

577
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
these conversations um i had uh

578
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,640
a friend and colleague who's a cso at

579
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,960
another organization who said yeah

580
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,760
the

581
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
at the recent board meeting there they

582
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,919
asked me well how come i can log into to

583
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,960
my

584
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,520
uh you know ipad and my iphone with my

585
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,799
fingerprint

586
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,280
but i can't just get into

587
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
corporate services what are you guys

588
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
doing to to make things easier this was

589
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,440
an engineering firm

590
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
and uh you know the underlying subtext

591
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
is if you make it easier we're more our

592
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
workforce is more productive more

593
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,400
effective and so on so i think the the

594
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,640
consumer side is driving so much of it

595
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,919
and effectively that's just a password

596
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
to the log right in

597
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,559
once you log into to your desktop from a

598
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,320
password today or

599
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
windows hello or some of these other

600
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,679
mechanisms

601
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,080
the next use case to consider is

602
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
accessing any federated sas apps

603
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,159
federated is a key word here now as web

604
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,400
authen and

605
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,520
ctap again for the 502 standard

606
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,440
becomes more acceptable more widely used

607
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,120
it was standardized and accepted by the

608
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,880
wc3

609
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
at uh around rsa2019 so if it's had some

610
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
time to to gain some traction but as we

611
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,679
know with sas apps

612
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,720
it can take a while

613
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,799
for the applications

614
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,600
to

615
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
adopt

616
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,159
new standards i mean saml has been out

617
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:32,960
for

618
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,039
uh what about a decade and we still have

619
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,760
a lot of sites that don't support saml

620
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,559
and don't support ssl

621
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,559
especially in the financial sector where

622
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,480
you've got a lot of legacy portals they

623
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
have a lot of legacy web apps and

624
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,919
they're still using things like forms

625
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,559
based authentication so we know there's

626
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,159
going to be a long tail of adoption

627
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,760
where

628
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
the very well known very well

629
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,960
established very well used sas apps just

630
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
like they adopted ssl and saml early on

631
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
will adopt passwordless

632
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
and

633
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,360
um and 502

634
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,799
quickly

635
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,200
for most of the other ones

636
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,679
if we can do ssl that's what we'd be

637
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,000
pushing them put them in sso portal

638
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,679
deliver them that way

639
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
i think the the most recent uh survey

640
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
point i saw was around 40 to 50 apps is

641
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
what a typical enterprise has

642
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,760
in their

643
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
uh sso portal good good i mean it's a

644
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,240
good start again remember you probably

645
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,400
have 1400 apps and the adversaries are

646
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
going to attack

647
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,880
13

648
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
uh 50 of those if you're doing 50 in sso

649
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,159
but have a plan in place to start

650
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,520
putting those in that will be the second

651
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,200
major use case

652
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
another use case is connecting through

653
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,520
vpn or similar proxy to gain access to

654
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,279
on-prem applications

655
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
so maybe they've gone through all this

656
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,480
maybe they want to send some email or

657
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
check some email so we're also going to

658
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,679
have those

659
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,919
personal apps that are on your desktop

660
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,159
again like your email application

661
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
or or whatnot so very broadly these are

662
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,080
the different use cases to be aware of

663
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,520
and these are the different use cases to

664
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,918
consider

665
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
and at the moment

666
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,240
one of the the challenges in the

667
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,840
passwordless space

668
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,600
is there are ways to solve

669
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,120
each one of these

670
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,440
but uh they're oftentimes not the same

671
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
way which leads to

672
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,559
disparate ids disparate authentication

673
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,520
points uh disparate policies to put in

674
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
place it leads to a lot of a lot of

675
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,840
mismatch

676
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,200
so in addition to looking this from a

677
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,120
use case perspective

678
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
you want to look at opportunities for

679
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,240
consolidation and plan for that

680
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
all right now

681
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,679
around

682
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,720
passwords and authentication oftentimes

683
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,279
password has been the the first in

684
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,799
setting the last line of defense

685
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,559
we need to not only look at passwordless

686
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,799
as a way to address that authentication

687
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,200
factor but we also need to look at the

688
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,559
move to passwordless as a way to improve

689
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,799
authentication make sure it's not just

690
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,960
one line of defense

691
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,799
you know in uh i mentioned earlier i'm

692
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,880
from michigan i'm in detroit

693
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,039
and uh you know what was high tech in

694
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
detroit 100 years ago it was high tech

695
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
in detroit it was the the horseless

696
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,279
carriage of course right it's a carriage

697
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,640
without a horse

698
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
now the term horse's carriage must like

699
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,760
much like passer-less defined the

700
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,159
innovation by what it wasn't

701
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,360
and it belied the incredible increase in

702
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
safety

703
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,039
and speed and the changes in our culture

704
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
that came with the automobile

705
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
um and of course we're making that same

706
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,559
mistake if you think about it today with

707
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,320
driverless cars what is what is a

708
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,919
driverless car it's a car without a

709
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,520
driver just like a horse's carriage was

710
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,000
a carriage without a horse uh we need to

711
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,919
be very very careful

712
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,760
with passer-less authentication that we

713
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,240
don't just pitch and hold into oh it's

714
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
authentication without a password we

715
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,760
need to improve the overall

716
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,600
machine side of authentication

717
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,159
in order to not only uh

718
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,400
strengthen the security properties get

719
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,720
the most out of the shift but also be

720
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
prepared for whenever there are

721
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,760
biometrics attacks and what have you

722
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,200
so how do we do this well step one of

723
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
course is is with good old rules and

724
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,240
correlation and policy

725
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,559
one of the main ways to do that is with

726
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,880
device identity so

727
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
this could be certificate based or it

728
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
could be agent-based it can be managed

729
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,960
by your mdm

730
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
um it could be as simple as a cookie if

731
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,200
we start thinking about like the the

732
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
customer side of this but from a

733
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,679
workforce perspective

734
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
i can have a significantly higher degree

735
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
of confidence

736
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,520
that you are who you say you are

737
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
if you're on the devices i've provided

738
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
you right or if you're on a device even

739
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
if it's a personal device a device you

740
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
use all the time adversaries are going

741
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,159
to be coming in from different devices

742
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,080
that do not have this check do not have

743
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,400
the certs do not have the ability to

744
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,559
authenticate the device so one of the

745
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,960
early ways that we can build policy

746
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,520
around passer-less is to restrict it to

747
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,720
the devices that we have in our control

748
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,520
we could also look at some additional

749
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,799
aspects of that device so adversaries

750
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
are are not breaking and they're logging

751
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,760
in but once they can no longer log in

752
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,039
they're going to start breaking in more

753
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,720
and how do you break in well you break

754
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
in with unpatched software so we want to

755
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
make sure these devices are patched

756
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,440
we want to make sure that they've got

757
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,399
good hygiene on them um that you know

758
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,600
they got a password they're encrypted

759
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,799
all that sort of stuff they're running

760
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,480
anti-malware agents that's important you

761
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,919
know anything

762
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,000
that you can check at a policy level to

763
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,080
make sure that this device is up to

764
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,039
stuff

765
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,520
and finally state

766
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,840
jailbroken is the easy one jailbroken is

767
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
the one that most uh most organizations

768
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,000
adopt very quickly you should jailbreak

769
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
your phones uh that that's a problem

770
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,640
right that introduces all sorts of

771
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
security weaknesses and with a

772
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,399
jailbroken phone it's incredibly easy to

773
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
run malware anything else um

774
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,559
additionally on

775
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,640
desktops and whatnot where you do have

776
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
into mower

777
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,760
you shouldn't be infected you shouldn't

778
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,919
have malware on your box and then

779
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,799
connect now that's

780
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,039
assuming the anti-malware tools can

781
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,279
catch the valor of the box we have some

782
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,559
assumptions there

783
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,799
but uh it will be interesting to see

784
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,640
here's here's a little bit of prediction

785
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,760
for you much the same way

786
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,799
ransomware right in the beginning

787
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,880
ransomware is a consumer driven thing

788
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,039
ransomware attacked a consumer or

789
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,039
someone at home and people paid it and

790
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,279
it was no big deal and then it evolved

791
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,080
into being an organizational problem

792
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
right as being an attack that's carried

793
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,760
out on major organizations

794
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
today

795
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,399
um

796
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,880
you know phone fraud

797
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,720
screen sharing

798
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,039
uh you know those sort of things

799
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,360
warranty fraud where someone calls up

800
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
and says hey hello you know i'm for

801
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,120
microsoft your computer has a problem

802
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
let me log in and fix it those things

803
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
are consumer problems right they they

804
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,240
target uh the vulnerable and uh and

805
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,720
they're carried out in a way that um is

806
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
usually

807
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,840
leading to

808
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,080
getting bank account information whatnot

809
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,919
not a good thing

810
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
however

811
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
you can see a clear path in parallel

812
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,600
between that and ran somewhere right as

813
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,080
it becomes ever more difficult

814
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,200
to

815
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,320
log in

816
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
using someone's credentials

817
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
there's going to be i believe an

818
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
improvement a maturation and a

819
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
weaponization of that tactic today used

820
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
for home users to take over the screen

821
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,960
tomorrow used against our workforce

822
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,880
to go ahead and

823
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,120
wait for them to log in and then go and

824
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,440
ride in that trusted path so we want to

825
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
make sure that these computers are not

826
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,799
affected

827
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,159
and and are free for malware

828
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,039
all right

829
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,039
once we've got those rules and

830
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,480
correlation right the things that we can

831
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,720
codify and get out of the way then we

832
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,919
can start looking at more advanced ways

833
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,760
to increase trust and authentication

834
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,480
so if you look at ml you know one of the

835
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,559
the easiest ways that uh we're all

836
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,559
familiar with it is and i did this many

837
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,080
times putting together this deck as you

838
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,480
go on google and you throw in what you

839
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
want to look for maybe it's cake and it

840
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
you know google returns you a whole

841
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,399
bunch of pictures of cake awesome good

842
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,640
great now what's interesting about this

843
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,520
is a couple things one that training set

844
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,640
required some well-defined results right

845
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,360
we we have a very clear combination of

846
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,279
this action and this result

847
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,960
and the trainings that record a lot of

848
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,120
training data so a million people are

849
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,600
probably searching cake today and every

850
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
single time it's searched is refined and

851
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
improved

852
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,120
and then finally

853
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,679
it requires results that work when

854
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,519
they're good enough

855
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,559
so

856
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,240
if you're getting all these pictures

857
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,080
back for cake

858
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,679
maybe the cupcakes are not what you

859
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
wanted right but it's very easy not to

860
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,000
download or click on that right okay

861
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,399
you've narrowed it down for me i can i

862
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,039
can take it from here it's good enough

863
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,039
but if you look at the top right that's

864
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,200
not cake that's sushi not even close to

865
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,760
correct we can easily ignore that and

866
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
move on

867
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
however

868
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,880
these conditions

869
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,559
well-defined results

870
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,880
lots of training data good enough where

871
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,360
a human can make the the last mile

872
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,159
decision are not necessarily the cases

873
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,200
for

874
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,120
uh insider attacks and for the type of

875
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,640
attacks that can be stopped by aiaml

876
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,120
right they say a sufficiently successful

877
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,360
attacker is indistinguishable from an

878
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,279
insider

879
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,279
well

880
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,880
what do we do with that we got way too

881
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,919
much data it's not a well-defined result

882
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,480
we've got high variability in what looks

883
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,960
like normal

884
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,039
not even to to

885
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,960
even think about what happens for

886
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,600
abnormal i had a lot of conversations

887
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,919
when we did the shift from working

888
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,000
remote to working at home and i would

889
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,640
say hey how did your aiml hold up right

890
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,480
how did that ueba project that took you

891
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
six months or a year to tune hold up

892
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,519
every person to a person said we turned

893
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,480
it off it created too many uh false

894
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,399
positives uh

895
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,720
and it basically treated everything as

896
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,440
intact because everyone was suddenly

897
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
not working the way they used to they're

898
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,120
working remote and working in different

899
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,039
ways and of course

900
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,399
the train data couldn't keep up with

901
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,200
that

902
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,159
so we've got a lot of of challenges in

903
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,960
the data and false positives are very

904
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,120
inexpensive right it's very easy to

905
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,240
ignore the sushi but if the sushi

906
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,559
creates a bunch of alerts well we're

907
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,279
just adding to the alert fatigue that

908
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,519
organizations already face

909
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,440
recent study found that uh you know

910
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
two-thirds of organizations see more

911
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
than ten thousand alerts per day

912
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
we don't be adding to that

913
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
with uh with aml that's one of the

914
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,320
problems uh that's uh the issue and if

915
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,039
you bump out one of the legitimate

916
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,000
alerts

917
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,039
right by adding to the noise well now

918
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,960
we've just actually increased the

919
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,279
organization's risk because they're not

920
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,480
the sock is not going to see that

921
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,840
they're going to investigate it it's

922
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,279
been bumped out and added to

923
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,640
in addition you've got the very real

924
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,480
risk of you know denial of service by

925
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,760
security

926
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
a mistake

927
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,080
in some of these pattern behaviors that

928
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,480
leads directly to policy decision to

929
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,559
block the user depending on what these

930
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,240
users doing depending on what's going on

931
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,360
can of course be very expensive

932
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,480
so if you're familiar with the old

933
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,720
pyramid of a pain by david bianco

934
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,760
very useful for um very useful for

935
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,520
building socks and tools and everything

936
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,879
else

937
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,199
i want you can contextualize these two

938
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,040
steps for increasing trust and

939
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,560
authentication uh as follows the first

940
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,760
layer is the rules the correlation the

941
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,159
solid metrics right we're going to look

942
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,440
at where you're coming from we're going

943
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,199
to look at your host we're going to look

944
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,040
at making sure that the host is

945
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,560
something that we know that the host is

946
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,040
not infected all those sort of things

947
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,679
that can very easily be handled by rules

948
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,639
based

949
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,839
strong policy yes known decisions

950
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,480
on top of that that last mile the more

951
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,560
challenging ttps and whatnot those are

952
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,839
the things that we want to handle with

953
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,320
aml we want to handle those with a very

954
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,480
tight data set hopefully just looking at

955
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
how people are authenticating

956
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,679
and

957
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,440
feed that information into the process

958
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,760
to reduce risk so

959
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,680
all that's to say

960
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,960
a good algorithm in this

961
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
world in this regards is an algorithm

962
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,280
that

963
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,400
is looking at that authentication

964
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,359
and making decisions post policy

965
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,200
to say hey where do they usually come

966
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
from what do they usually run what time

967
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,280
are they usually at what devices are

968
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,440
they usually using what factors are they

969
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
usually using and

970
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,920
build on the fly very quickly a

971
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
fingerprint of what that person looks

972
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,000
like in a normal day-to-day basis and

973
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,119
then raises that risk whenever it's seen

974
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,520
that it's outside of the rack and it's

975
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,440
too far outside the norm of course then

976
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,040
we can go ahead and actually do do a

977
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
blocking we've got a really high degree

978
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
of confidence

979
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,560
that it is where they say they are

980
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,040
all that's to say when we think about

981
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,440
passwordless authentication it has to be

982
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
more than just removing the password we

983
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,520
think about passwords authentication has

984
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,960
to be

985
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,440
putting more onus on the machines

986
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,119
it has to be bringing in things like

987
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,040
contextual authentication has to be like

988
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
bringing in things like risk-based

989
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,040
authentication it has to be

990
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,800
not only are we improving the life of

991
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,760
the user and making their path easier

992
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,480
and making it uh more straightforward

993
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,400
but at the same time we're increasing

994
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,640
the complexity the difficulty

995
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,400
and increasing the number of choices and

996
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,920
decisions that the adversaries have to

997
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
make in order to to get in

998
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,599
if

999
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,640
if

1000
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,160
someone

1001
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,440
is able to

1002
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,760
get into my home

1003
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,400
and get at my phone in my computer

1004
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,599
and clone by biometrics and open up

1005
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,160
applications the same way i do and use

1006
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,720
applications the same way i do um at

1007
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
that point in time well you know maybe

1008
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
i'll just uh

1009
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
maybe i'll just hire him as a contractor

1010
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,119
right i mean at that point in time

1011
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,800
that's incredibly unlikely incredibly

1012
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,720
costly

1013
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,920
attack

1014
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,640
so

1015
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,960
we want to raise those factors the

1016
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,440
risk-based authentication factors by

1017
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,079
using strong policy and by

1018
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
using

1019
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,040
using strong ml

1020
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,720
all right in conclusion and conclusion

1021
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
of this attack as i mentioned earlier

1022
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,280
right most security

1023
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,359
asks too much of the user and doesn't

1024
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,680
ask enough of the attacker

1025
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,280
we know the user and the adversary are

1026
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,520
taking two different paths

1027
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,560
and most the time we put in

1028
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,920
front

1029
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,480
things that are on the user path without

1030
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,280
necessarily putting them in the path of

1031
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,400
the adversary we increase the work load

1032
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,760
on the users

1033
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,200
without necessarily increasing the

1034
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,480
workload on on the adversary it's very

1035
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,440
important with passwordless that we make

1036
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,119
the users lives much easier

1037
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,800
while at the same time adding those

1038
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,119
risk-based factors and additional policy

1039
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,880
to make it much harder for criminals to

1040
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,440
get into our systems

1041
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,040
and this is going to be a rinse and

1042
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,480
repeat process right there's going to

1043
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
need to be a series of use cases i

1044
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,920
highlighted the main ones for you

1045
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,960
earlier

1046
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,520
you want to deploy those use cases

1047
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,760
for usability and defensibility you want

1048
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
to deploy those in sprints

1049
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
checking it with

1050
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,160
your user community get uh get a good

1051
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,320
set of stakeholders get a good set of

1052
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,760
voices we can give you real-time

1053
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
feedback so yes this is great we love it

1054
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,119
or no this doesn't really simplify my

1055
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,680
world think about the

1056
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,599
the life cycle of onboarding and off

1057
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,800
boarding

1058
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,040
think about the life cycle of

1059
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
replacing devices replacing factors or

1060
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,560
losing devices and losing factors as the

1061
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,920
case may be

1062
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,800
and make sure it is truly truly usable

1063
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,359
do a series of pilots with some a good

1064
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,160
team who can give you good feedback

1065
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,320
on the defensibility side

1066
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
this is where you want to

1067
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,119
engage your your red team

1068
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,000
to you know test the solution out to pen

1069
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,160
test it to figure out how to get around

1070
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,359
it

1071
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,280
to make sure that

1072
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,079
in

1073
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,160
changing factors and removing passwords

1074
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,040
that we've also increased the security

1075
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,200
and increase our ability to put in place

1076
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,359
good smart policy

1077
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,119
also in addition to this

1078
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,320
when we start thinking about federated

1079
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,760
accounts and everything else

1080
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,200
keep in mind what happens post

1081
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,960
authentication so have your red team

1082
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,280
also look at

1083
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,359
saml assertions

1084
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,320
uh oauth and oidc access tokens and

1085
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,839
identity tokens

1086
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,280
have them consider

1087
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,359
the whole life cycle

1088
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,160
of

1089
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,400
access including authentication

1090
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,520
authorization and use and and poke at it

1091
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,079
hard to make sure that there's been no

1092
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,480
mistakes in the implementation that

1093
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
could potentially reduce your overall

1094
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,040
security

1095
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,160
a very broad path to passwordless would

1096
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
include establishing multi-factor and

1097
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,800
identifying use cases making sure that

1098
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,880
you've got good coverage over those

1099
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,680
fourteen hundred apps identifying any

1100
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,359
any gaps now you see protocols and

1101
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,480
whatnot

1102
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,520
consolidate authentication workflows

1103
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,920
uh i mentioned a typical user has 191

1104
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,960
passwords we want to get that down as

1105
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,520
few as possible uh i mentioned that an

1106
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,839
average organization only has around 50

1107
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,480
apps in an sso we want to get that down

1108
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,800
as much as possible consolidate it

1109
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,640
because passwordless

1110
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,400
should certainly mean authenticating

1111
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,960
without a password but it also should

1112
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
mean fewer times authenticating right

1113
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,440
fewer times doing that process how do

1114
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
you get there or you get there by

1115
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,880
consolidating it also means you've got

1116
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,040
fewer points to protect and build policy

1117
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,480
around

1118
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,920
from there increase trust and

1119
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
passwordless authentication which has

1120
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,960
really been the bulk of this

1121
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,280
conversation today and i'm going to

1122
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,119
touch on that a little bit more in just

1123
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,520
a second the main points that you can

1124
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
use to increase trust

1125
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
once you've got that once you've got

1126
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,280
good trust you've got consolidation

1127
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,880
you've got factors you can use you can

1128
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
go ahead and enable that passwordless

1129
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,079
experience

1130
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,760
and then you can optimize the passwords

1131
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,640
tool setting in stage four and five what

1132
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,839
i'm really concerned about and

1133
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,920
organizations are more uh you know

1134
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,680
further along this journey than than

1135
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,000
others what they run into is i've got

1136
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
one source of authentication over there

1137
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,119
i got another over here and a third over

1138
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
there and i got multiple policies right

1139
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,520
we need a way to to optimize and

1140
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,839
rationalize that that password policy

1141
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,200
set and a recognition that much like

1142
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,160
the the move to to cloud has meant we've

1143
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,000
existed in a hybrid state for a very

1144
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,760
long time

1145
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,839
the move to authenticating without a

1146
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,400
password with the trusted authentication

1147
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,440
path consolidated authentication path

1148
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,760
will undoubtedly mean

1149
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
that we're going to be

1150
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,079
in the state of still having legacy apps

1151
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,880
stealing old passwords still having a

1152
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,480
hybrid environment so we want to plan

1153
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,640
for that now and figure out how we're

1154
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
going to handle that

1155
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
on the increased trust in authentication

1156
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,760
um some of the ways to do that smarter

1157
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,440
platforms i mentioned some of the

1158
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,800
improvements that have been made in

1159
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
our phones and our laptops we want to

1160
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,960
continue to press

1161
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
our vendors

1162
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,040
to improve these environments

1163
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,359
i really like what's been happening with

1164
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,680
biometrics and how it is held on the

1165
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
device it authenticates and identifies

1166
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,400
you to the device but any authentication

1167
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,839
post that does not rely on your

1168
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,920
authenticator does not rely on your

1169
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,720
biometric it relies on key material and

1170
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,640
oscar on flavor tpm i think that's

1171
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,880
brilliant it's brilliant because we

1172
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,640
don't have to worry about biometric data

1173
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,200
on everything it's just an identifier so

1174
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,760
smarter platforms is going to get us a a

1175
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,160
good way down the path

1176
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,680
device trust is a

1177
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,599
topic i touched on make sure you can

1178
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,599
authenticate the device that only

1179
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,000
trusted devices are able to log in that

1180
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,319
will greatly reduce your attack surface

1181
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,440
and greatly increase the complexity

1182
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,400
of the

1183
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,040
attack path the adversary have to take

1184
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,520
closing residual risk with adaptive

1185
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,079
policies and then apply on top of that

1186
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,599
behavior analytics

1187
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,480
to model your activity and telemetry and

1188
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,119
act accordingly

1189
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,079
so with that it's going to be a a long

1190
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,280
haul as we plug in the puzzle pieces to

1191
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,480
get all our applications into this i i

1192
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,599
would point you back to the journey

1193
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,000
we've all been taking with sso i would

1194
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,280
point you back to the journey we've all

1195
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
been taking with cloud we know there's a

1196
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,520
lot that has to happen to get

1197
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,280
infrastructure to modernize and

1198
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,880
consolidate

1199
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,440
however however i think this is a very

1200
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,960
exciting time

1201
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,000
because we've been stuck with passwords

1202
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,920
since the 60s we've been stuck with

1203
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,240
passwords since that ibm mainframe that

1204
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,000
ibm mainframe by the way

1205
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,200
um was the the same one that inspired

1206
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,359
uh hal in 2001 it was the same one that

1207
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,200
arthur c clarke heard

1208
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,319
singing daisy and hadn't realized the

1209
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,040
the potential uh for ai now of course

1210
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,960
2001 is nothing

1211
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,000
like the the movie 2021 there's nothing

1212
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,560
like the movie we do not have hal

1213
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,400
but we do have

1214
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,640
some compelling technologies

1215
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,480
that can solve a lot of these problems

1216
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,760
and simplify the way people authenticate

1217
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,440
and at the end of the day i think it's

1218
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,119
it's been long enough it's been long

1219
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:29,920
enough

1220
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,319
that we've been reliant on the single

1221
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,319
factor

1222
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,440
this uh this quote comes from uh jake

1223
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,680
ingman at uh duel in r d spotlight last

1224
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
summer and he said you know

1225
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,160
i got a new kid and i i want to make

1226
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,079
sure that he never has to know the pain

1227
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,319
of a password and i heard that i'm like

1228
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,280
yes

1229
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,839
yes let's move things forward

1230
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,839
so with that

1231
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,200
with that thought

1232
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,800
with that hope

1233
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,319
i'll turn you back to the rest of the

1234
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,800
conference i hope you've enjoyed this

1235
