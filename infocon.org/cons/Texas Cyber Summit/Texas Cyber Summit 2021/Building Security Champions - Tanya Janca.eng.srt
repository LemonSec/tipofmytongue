00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,119
hi

2
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,520
my name is tanya jenka and today we are

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,199
going to talk about

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
building security champions

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
so security champions don't just appear

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,359
out of nowhere and be awesome and do

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,599
everything perfectly you have to find

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,239
the right people like attract them find

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
them engage with them teach them and

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,399
build them up

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,360
into being your champions and security

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,280
champions are those people that are on

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
every other team except the security

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,079
team

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,440
but who sing the praises and advocate

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
for security they're the people that

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,039
alert you when things should happen

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
they're the people that let you know

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,960
what's going on and they help

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
proliferate that knowledge that you've

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,760
given them to all the other teams

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,640
and

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
we're going to talk basically about how

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
to scale your team today oh and i'm

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,760
tanya janka um also known as shiax

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,000
purple i am your giant nerd that will

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,960
talk to you during uh this talk

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,080
okay

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
let's do this

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
so

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,520
i like to tell you what i'm gonna tell

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
you then i tell you then i tell you what

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
i told you i'm that type of speaker

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,479
and so we are going to talk about

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,880
scaling your security team and scaling

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,799
your security program we're going to

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
talk about what security champions are

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,960
and how to build them up so how to like

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
find people who are interested in

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,439
security or curious and then turn them

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,600
into champions

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
this is the recipe we're gonna follow so

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
we're gonna go back to this recipe all

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,200
throughout the talk

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
and i'm gonna give you a bunch of action

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,439
items for each one and then basically i

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,360
hope you go off and build totally

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,159
awesome security champion teams yeah

49
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,399
okay so we're gonna recruit people

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,799
we're gonna engage the people we find

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,040
we're gonna teach them awesome stuff

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,038
we're gonna recognize them for the hard

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,959
work we're doing that they are doing

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
we're gonna reward them for the awesome

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
work they're doing and then the most

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,040
important part

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
don't stop

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
most security champions programs start

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
off hot

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,599
fast

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,520
look super energetic and then after

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,599
three months they run out of steam and

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
so we're gonna talk about how to pace

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
yourself so it continues and it's good

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
and basically you have this amazing

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
program for years to come

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
okay so who the heck am i so

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
so speakers do this where we talk about

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
ourselves and tell you about ourselves

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
in hopes to show you that we're totally

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,599
qualified to give our own talk so i

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,640
founded my own startup company we hack

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,680
purple

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
i'm also known as she hacks purple i

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,519
wrote a book alice and bob learns

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,519
application security i've been in tech a

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,159
long time um i'm one of the founders of

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
wosec women of security i love a wasp i

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,159
basically i am a nerd at large on the

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,319
internet and i hope this is enough for

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,920
you you're like she's all right i guess

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
i'll sit through this i'll tolerate

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
tanya for a while

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
good

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,959
so

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,879
okay so let's talk about the problem for

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,640
like one second

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
and then for the rest of the talk let's

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,680
just fix

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,000
the problem okay

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
so the problem there's just not enough

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,560
security professionals and what i

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
specialize in is the security of

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
software so everything i say is gonna

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,799
have like a software slant rather than a

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,080
hardware

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
infrastructure

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
iot cloud slant i'm always focusing

99
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
around software because i was a software

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
developer for a really long time i've

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
been coding since i was 16 years old and

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
that is a long time

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
um and i still write code sometimes

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,080
um and i read a lot of code

105
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,439
and so there's just but there's not

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,400
enough

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
there's not enough security people to do

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,879
all the jobs and it's a problem it's a

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,959
problem in our industry and so what we

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
need to do is we need to scale our

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,200
program and

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,759
often in security

113
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
or just in tech in general we talk about

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,240
scaling like you know i made a web app

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
and i only thought i'd get like 100

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
visitors a day but i'm getting a

117
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
thousand visitors a day and that's

118
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,600
awesome but i need to scale you know my

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,120
infrastructure and maybe i need to

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
re-architect my app so it could handle

121
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,199
this new load well guess what the

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,880
security team

123
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
is drastically outnumbered and so we

124
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
need to scale ourselves and hiring 25

125
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
more people to the security teams

126
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,960
usually not an option and so we need to

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
find other ways where we're not working

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
more hours in burning ourselves out we

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
need to find ways where we work smarter

130
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
and better and more effectively and more

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
efficiently

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,639
and one of those ways that we can scale

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,039
our teams is security champions and

134
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,479
that's what this whole talk will be

135
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,840
about

136
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,000
and you don't have to be in application

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
security

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,199
you could be in other areas of security

139
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,960
it's okay you could still do security

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,680
champions but when i have an app focused

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,280
that's why because that's my history so

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,720
formal definition of security champions

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,080
so i'm gonna read it to you and then

144
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
show it to you because you're just gonna

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
actually just read it together so

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,600
security champion is a member of the

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
team that takes on the responsibility of

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,039
acting as the primary advocate for

149
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,280
security within the team and acting as

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
the first line of defense for security

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,919
issues

152
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,080
within the team so that's like wikipedia

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
thank you very much

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,080
but let's say it more plainly it is the

155
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
person that is the most excited about

156
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,520
security it's the person that reads the

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
book that fixes the bug that asks the

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
questions that shows up for the lunch

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,319
and learn every single time that's the

160
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
champion that's your person

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
and so what what what is a security

162
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
champion tanya like you're giving these

163
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,759
vague definitions could you tell me more

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,639
of course i've got like

165
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,280
34 more minutes more for you

166
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,639
so as a security champion okay they are

167
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,440
your communicator so they deliver

168
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
messages like security messages to the

169
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
dev team

170
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,039
they teach and they share and they help

171
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,840
so you train all of your champions and

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
then they go off and help other people

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
with that security stuff

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,840
they're your point of contact so they

175
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,120
deliver messages uh to like back to the

176
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
security team and keep you up to date on

177
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,440
what matters they alert you if they're

178
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
scary stuff that they noticed if they

179
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,199
trust you they will tell you

180
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,800
so many things

181
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
and they are your advocate

182
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
so they perform security work for their

183
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,520
dev team with your help and they

184
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,639
advocate for security and so what i mean

185
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,520
by that is they

186
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,599
have a bit of a cold sorry there's a

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,680
frog in my throat sort of so if you

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,520
sound scratchy it's because it is

189
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,000
they they advocate for security so

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,840
they'll be the person in the meeting

191
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
that you can't make it to because you

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
were never invited to that team meeting

193
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
and they're like you know what i'm not

194
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,039
sure if that's a really secure way to do

195
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,000
it

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,560
maybe we should ask us to like run this

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
by the security team and like see if

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
they have ideas of how we could do this

199
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
safer

200
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,160
them saying that is such a huge deal it

201
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,240
can change the entire trajectory of a

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,919
project of them just speaking up in a

203
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,960
meeting

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
and they are the peers of their

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
teammates you aren't you're on some

206
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
other team your security you're over

207
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
here perhaps some of them consider you

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
their enemy or their frenemy or that

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
person that says no all the time but

210
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
this security champion is their peer and

211
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,479
what that person thinks matters to them

212
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,240
and they will take them more seriously

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,800
and trust them more readily and that is

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,360
the magic of security champions

215
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
so let's talk about building champions

216
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
and we're gonna do this recipe like i

217
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,560
said so we're gonna go through all six

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
of these one at a time

219
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
for the rest of this talk

220
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,440
and

221
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,759
yeah let's be awesome together okay so

222
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,080
first of all

223
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,599
recruit so we are going to recruit

224
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,639
champions

225
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,360
yeah champions

226
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,599
i know that i'm silly i'm silly all the

227
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,199
time not just when i give talks that's

228
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,479
just part of the deal

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,240
but the information i'm giving is good

230
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,039
despite my silly demeanor okay so the

231
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,440
number one rule

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
in recruiting security champions

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
is the num most important thing

234
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,719
do not volunteer

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,799
someone to be a champion

236
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,480
it's like hey you relate to the meeting

237
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
you're a security champion

238
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
that's not gonna be good that person's

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
not gonna be awesome they're not gonna

240
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,519
be helpful

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
what we wanted to do is we want to

242
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
attract

243
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
the right people

244
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
and so even if this person's like junior

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
dev and they hardly know anything but

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
they're excited about security that

247
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
person will do more for you even though

248
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
they know less they have less authority

249
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
that person is excited curious

250
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
interested that's the one you actually

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,000
want

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
okay so number two most important rule

253
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,480
managers need to be on board if managers

254
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
are not bored they will stop them from

255
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,680
doing this work they'll be like tanya

256
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
stop wasting so and so's time

257
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
i don't have time for you to take my

258
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,200
staff members stop it

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
you don't want that that sucks that

260
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,959
sucks for your champion it sucks for you

261
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,640
so it's really important that managers

262
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
need to be on board you need to have

263
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,320
approved well you don't have to have

264
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
approval for your program but it'll go

265
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
way better if you do i didn't have

266
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
approval for my program i had no idea

267
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,640
what i was doing and before i knew it i

268
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
had a champions program and someone that

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
i met was like oh so you have security

270
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
champions i'm like what's that there's

271
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,279
just like a person on each team that's

272
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,160
my person that i always talk to and they

273
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,680
just like like how'd you find them i'm

274
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,279
like they're sort of self-identified i

275
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,320
just like

276
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
kept doing all this stuff and they just

277
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
kept showing up and it's like oh well

278
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,279
i'm gonna ask liam because he's the one

279
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
that always shows up i'm gonna ask that

280
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
fan because he's always the one that

281
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
asks the questions and shows up and then

282
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
eventually

283
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
they're your champions and so let's come

284
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
up with a plan for recruiting

285
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,440
okay so like i said ask for volunteers

286
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
instead of appointing people without

287
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
consent consent is cool

288
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,880
provide opportunities for them to reveal

289
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,440
themselves and so this might sound so

290
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,640
silly but someone that i work with

291
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
he i i suggested he added to his

292
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
signature of his email it's just like

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
i'm looking for security champions is

294
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
this you ask me how

295
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,440
and he found four people responded and

296
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
two of them became security champions

297
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,519
yes

298
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
attract your volunteers so use lunch and

299
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,480
learns or give trainings

300
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
i know that i'm a professional public

301
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,519
speaker at this point so people are like

302
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,519
oh well that's easy for you well it was

303
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,839
not always easy for me and i sucked just

304
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,680
as much as the next person when i

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,720
started and it is like brute force

306
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
practicing over and over and over again

307
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,320
that made me good at this i was not

308
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
magically good at it trust me i really

309
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,040
sucked

310
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
anyone who asks questions or attends

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
events that person could be your

312
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
champion

313
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
use interesting titles for stuff if you

314
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
can so my my first lunch and learn

315
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
i sent an email to all the devs that i

316
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,120
knew and i said i'm gonna break into a

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,040
bank at lunch who wants to watch me hack

318
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
and a bunch of people showed up and

319
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
they're like what are you talking about

320
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
tony you can't break into a bank i'm

321
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
like it's a fake bank but i'm gonna

322
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,560
break in

323
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,079
and then i showed them what sql

324
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,160
injection was and they're like

325
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
okay so that was actually kind of neat

326
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
like yeah let's check our apps to see if

327
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
we could fall for that trick

328
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,120
let's make us and and i just kept being

329
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
really excited like i am and they kept

330
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
showing up and even though it was

331
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
terrifying at first for me to talk to

332
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
them eventually i'm like these are just

333
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,399
my teammates they're just people on

334
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,839
other teams they're people from where i

335
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,200
work they're not scary they're actually

336
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
really nice it turns out

337
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,040
i mean they were always nice to me

338
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
before that but i guess i was afraid

339
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
that i would speak and that they would

340
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
become mean which in retrospect makes no

341
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,040
sense but anyway

342
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,399
they kept putting up with me and it got

343
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,760
better and better

344
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,519
and i also

345
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,920
this is the thing that has helped in so

346
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,440
many organizations is attract

347
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
adopting the mantra so the security team

348
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,720
adopts the mantra

349
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,120
it is my job to serve you

350
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
so my friend ray first told me this and

351
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,519
i didn't realize that i did this but he

352
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,920
worded it in a way that's just so good

353
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,120
he would tell his devs

354
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,760
you're my customer

355
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,480
i i work for you and they're like no you

356
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
don't you work for the security team

357
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,959
he's like no no they pay me but i work

358
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
for you it's my job to make sure that

359
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,040
you can do your job securely and so if

360
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,639
you're off here and you don't know the

361
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
answers and stuff and i'm not helping

362
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
you then i'm failing my customer service

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
is bad and so

364
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,000
i work for you buddy even though you

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
don't pay me i work for you and it

366
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,480
really changed things for him and

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
um i had never worded it that way but

368
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,959
i'm like i'm here to help

369
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,360
right and when we change our mantra from

370
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
we are the people who say no or we are

371
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
the people who are frantically trying to

372
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
control these software developers and

373
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
devops and operations people and they're

374
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,800
all out of control and i want to control

375
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
them

376
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
when we change it

377
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,440
our mindset from that to

378
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
they have to build apps they have to

379
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,560
release software they have to support

380
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
the infrastructure that these apps are

381
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,160
sitting on and it's like it's my job to

382
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,199
help you

383
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
make sure you can do that

384
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,760
safely and securely it's my job to help

385
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,839
in any way i can to make sure what

386
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,199
you're building what you're supporting

387
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,760
is safe and secure for our customers to

388
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
use and when you like adopt this it

389
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,839
sounds weird but the way you word things

390
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,399
the way you approach things changes and

391
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,360
that has been magical in recruiting so

392
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,000
many more people to your program

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,279
okay so we're gonna go back to the

394
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,480
recipe now and now we're on engagement

395
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
so i'm going to explain what i mean by

396
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
that

397
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,160
now i'm going to give you a bunch of

398
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
ideas

399
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
when i give you ideas for each of these

400
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,079
these are just things that i've done

401
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,920
anything goes

402
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,720
anything that is positive and respectful

403
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
and not breaking the law

404
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,959
and not breaking policy at your work can

405
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
go and that can mean like all sorts of

406
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
things and so if you have a creative

407
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,320
idea that is different than these ideas

408
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
do it

409
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,199
okay so engagement

410
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,079
so

411
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,240
engagement means to occupy attract or

412
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,600
involve

413
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
people and for us this means insecurity

414
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
activities right so we want to

415
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
try to get them involved interested etc

416
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,399
it also means participate or become

417
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,920
involved

418
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
and we want them to do that with us but

419
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
we want to reciprocate that with them

420
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,720
so like this is a two-way street

421
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,079
you can't expect them to be super

422
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,399
excited running around like living and

423
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,720
breathing security if you don't care

424
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,920
what they do

425
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,320
and so both ways so engage so

426
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,959
ways like a way that i got engaged is i

427
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,959
got brought on a security incident so i

428
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,800
was on the security team but i was

429
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
actually an enterprise architect

430
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,959
i was briefly an enterprise architect

431
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,440
turns out i just love security um and i

432
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,880
just kept doing security and then they

433
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,639
had a big security incident and i said

434
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
like could i just sit in and they're

435
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
like i don't see the harm and then there

436
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,880
was code and i could read the code and

437
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,399
then i told them what the code said and

438
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,600
i was like oh my gosh we're getting

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
attacked like this and they're like

440
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
you can just read that crap on the

441
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,360
screen i'm like oh yeah

442
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,600
and then i was on the incident team for

443
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,880
that incident and then i got to

444
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,560
investigate and i was just like this is

445
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,079
amazing

446
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,000
so if you can bring a dev and

447
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,639
and help let them help you investigate

448
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,839
first of all they're gonna know a bunch

449
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,079
of stuff you might not know

450
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
especially if it's their app or an app

451
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
they've supported

452
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
and

453
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,600
like you did you just got a fan for life

454
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,639
um share appropriate secrets uh so i

455
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
worked somewhere and so this was not my

456
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
idea this was a guy phil it was his idea

457
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
and i was like fill this stupid idea

458
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
don't do this and i'd like to know i was

459
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
wrong phil was right

460
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,440
i'm sure somewhere he's like yes

461
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,519
uh and he shared all the dirty details

462
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,519
of a security incident that we had two

463
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,639
incidents

464
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,680
and

465
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
i really didn't want to i'm a

466
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,759
perfectionist sometimes and i found it

467
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
embarrassing to admit that we failed at

468
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,759
something but when he shared it with

469
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,959
them

470
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,959
they became energized they're like this

471
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,000
will never happen again we had no idea

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,160
you needed us i'm like of course we need

473
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,040
you

474
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,199
but i hadn't communicated in a way that

475
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
made sense to them and when phil told

476
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,959
them all the stuff he's like tanya tell

477
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,720
them what it was like

478
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
to talk to that one employee where we

479
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,880
lost some of her personal data and how

480
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
we had to get credit monitoring for her

481
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
and like she was a grandma and she was

482
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
crying i was trying to help her teach

483
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
her how to change her bank passwords and

484
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,319
stuff and he he's like we made an

485
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,679
employee cry

486
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,000
that's awful it was an awful day and

487
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
it's because we screwed up and we can't

488
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
do this without you

489
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,400
and

490
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
it was like

491
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,720
a strangely emotional work meeting but

492
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,520
it like they were warriors for us after

493
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
that it was amazing like a complete

494
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,600
change of attitude and so you can do

495
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,039
this too steal phil's awesome idea

496
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
let them see everything first these are

497
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,120
your awesome people these are like these

498
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
are people on the inside track and you

499
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
want to make them feel like it so show

500
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
them the cool new tools

501
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
tell them information that's coming tell

502
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
them everything and share everything

503
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
with them that is appropriate for you to

504
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
share before everyone else because they

505
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,559
are special so treat them like they're

506
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,679
special create a mailing list and tell

507
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,360
them about new security stuff and the

508
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,679
security stuff can be anything you want

509
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
right like anything that's upcoming

510
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
something new you learned here's a

511
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,120
podcast episode that came out that's

512
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
about like this framework that i know

513
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,480
some of you work on

514
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
you sharing information with them even

515
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,480
if they only read it half the time it's

516
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,080
still awesome when they do because

517
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,320
they're learning

518
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,760
if you can

519
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
meet with them once every month and have

520
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,559
a list of questions so my friend ray has

521
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,720
been doing this for five years with his

522
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
security champion team and he always

523
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
asks the same three things

524
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,880
what are you working on

525
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,640
what are you gonna work on

526
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,880
do you need any help those three

527
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
questions are magical and then you help

528
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,160
them and you ask more questions and you

529
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
find out if there's security stuff and

530
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
other things will end up coming up in

531
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
that meeting

532
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
and sometimes nothing comes up and

533
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
you're like cool see you next week but

534
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
other times they're like you know there

535
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,640
was this thing

536
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,600
and then they spill secrets

537
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,520
brace yourself for bad news so that you

538
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,679
can play it cool as you can tell i'm a

539
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,559
very expressive person i really suck at

540
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,360
hiding my feelings i'm like really bad

541
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,320
lying which is fine however when someone

542
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
gives me bad security news i've learned

543
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
to be like they're like oh so this is

544
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,240
probably nothing but

545
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
i'm always like play cool tanya pretend

546
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
you're playing poker be chill don't

547
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
because the first time one of them did i

548
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,960
was like oh my god

549
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
and that did not help my case and it

550
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
scared them then they didn't want to

551
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,880
tell me stuff anymore so play it cool if

552
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,720
you can note to self um do team building

553
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
events if you can so that they can know

554
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
each other because they can support each

555
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,000
other and if you're busy they might ask

556
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
some other person and find the answer

557
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
from them or work together

558
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
and that re-cements their relationship

559
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,240
as a security champion

560
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
invite them to join securities uh

561
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,679
communities so

562
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,760
i you know i used to be the oau's

563
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
chapter leader in my city and then now

564
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
we have a pandemic and everything's

565
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
awful but anyway and so what i do is

566
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,480
like obviously i as the chapter leader i

567
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
always know what was happening that

568
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,360
month and i'd be like hey guys guess

569
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
what this is happening does anyone want

570
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
to come with me and we would actually

571
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,799
walk from work together to the community

572
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,720
event and learn together and eat pizza

573
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,799
together and do all of the stuff

574
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
and it first of all formed great

575
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
relationships and second of all like

576
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,159
haha you're learning

577
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,159
getting my goal

578
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,400
okay so next what do you teach these

579
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
people what are you gonna teach your

580
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,080
champions

581
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,679
i have had so many clients

582
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,600
um so

583
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,159
i teach like at wehack purple and i make

584
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,840
courses that we hack purple and i give

585
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
training to companies and stuff but i

586
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,159
also consult on the side and i do like

587
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,400
lots of just one-off phone calls with

588
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,320
companies and help them and you would

589
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,880
not believe like everyone's like let's

590
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,720
teach them all these crazy hacking

591
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,799
things i'm like are you asking them to

592
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,480
become pen testers why are you training

593
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
them to become pen testers

594
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,039
they're like let's teach them you know

595
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,600
the ins and out of you know every type

596
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
of encryption do you make encryption

597
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,360
software no why are you teaching them

598
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,159
that

599
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,400
so the number one most important thing

600
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,919
in regard to what are you going to teach

601
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,200
your champions

602
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
is only teach them what they need to

603
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,760
know

604
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
do not teach them more

605
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,000
software developers infrastructure

606
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,280
people cloud people tech people we have

607
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,919
so much stuff inside our brain and we

608
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
have to learn new stuff constantly

609
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,799
because our

610
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,120
literally our our industry changes every

611
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,039
second every second something's new

612
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,520
especially in security so don't waste

613
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
their time with stuff they don't need to

614
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,240
know please for their sake for your sake

615
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
for industry's sake just stuff they need

616
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,440
to know so here is what

617
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,320
so ask yourself this what you need

618
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,240
expect and want from them as champions

619
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,600
what do you need from them what do you

620
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
expect from them and what do you want

621
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,080
from them

622
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
and i know those are slightly different

623
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,280
things ask yourself those three

624
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,159
questions and put that into a list and

625
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,200
teach them that and say explicitly

626
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,440
what you want from them like i want you

627
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,799
to show up to a one-on-one with me once

628
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,000
per month

629
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
to tell me what's going on what you're

630
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,280
working on and to see if i can help you

631
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
and i want you to show up to you know at

632
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,840
least

633
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,080
one lunch and learn per quarter like you

634
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,360
don't have to go to every single one of

635
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
them but like show up to at least one

636
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,559
please

637
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,360
and i need you to know our policies that

638
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,799
affect your team

639
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,440
and i want you to review

640
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,000
new things that like policies standards

641
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
or guidelines that apply to your team

642
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and i want you to alert me if there's

643
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
anything that's scary that you think i

644
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
should know about like that literally

645
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
could be what you say and that could be

646
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,679
your whole program and it sounds maybe

647
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,520
it sounds minimal but then you'll

648
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,960
actually get what you want because you

649
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
told them what you want you're very

650
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,799
specific and you're reasonable i've

651
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,159
heard people say well like they need to

652
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,320
do 20 to 30 hours per week with us i'm

653
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
like excuse me no

654
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,240
they need to do two to three hours a

655
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,520
month

656
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,360
okay let's look at topics for champions

657
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
so i'm gonna dig into each one of these

658
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
just to be clear so i'm gonna tell you

659
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,799
the three like kind of top topics and

660
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
then i'm gonna give you ideas within

661
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
there so

662
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,159
secure coding and architecture they

663
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,799
write code they build applications they

664
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,559
need to know secure design secure

665
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,559
architecture and secure coding they just

666
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,520
do

667
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,000
they need to know the policies your

668
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,159
policies that apply to the work that

669
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,440
they do

670
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,919
so not don't click this link

671
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,360
i mean that's stuff you need to cover

672
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,440
for everyone but they need to know like

673
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,279
if you have a secure coding guideline

674
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,120
they should know it

675
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
and tooling any tools that you expect

676
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
them to use as part of their job or

677
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
tools where they have to read the

678
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,679
results as part of their job

679
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
you should be teaching that to them okay

680
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
so first of all

681
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,679
secure coding and architecture so i

682
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,679
realize i'm biased because i give secure

683
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,520
coding training like day and night but i

684
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,679
believe that it is very important that's

685
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
why i started a company doing it you

686
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,600
don't have to hire my company obviously

687
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
it would be cool if you did but hire any

688
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,240
company or give them there's free stuff

689
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
on the internet like there's so many

690
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,960
things

691
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
but if they're doing coding supporting

692
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,159
them in that coding to be secure

693
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:26,960
um

694
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,799
threat modeling

695
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,240
yes

696
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,039
so your security champions if every time

697
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,320
there's a new app that they're

698
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,480
architecting if you could do a half hour

699
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
one hour session with them to talk with

700
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,799
them you know what could go wrong what

701
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,039
keeps you up at night invite a product

702
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,520
owner or representative so a person from

703
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,360
the business whatever you would like to

704
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,080
call them and have a discussion and

705
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,039
every single time that you do one of

706
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,880
those threat modeling sessions invite

707
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
one champion because first of all one it

708
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,640
engages them to their learning a new

709
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,600
skill and three to be quite honest they

710
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
are amazing at it

711
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
like i remember i invited these two devs

712
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,520
and they're like we all need to be here

713
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
blah blah blah and then part way through

714
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
the meeting i turned to them i'm like if

715
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,880
you were going to hack your app how

716
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,159
would you do it

717
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,480
oh i'd probably go in through like that

718
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
admin module that we made so we could

719
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,039
admin from home our boss won't give us

720
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,559
overtime and like we have to do this

721
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,720
thing at midnight once per month and

722
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
like neither of us wanted to drive

723
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
across town at midnight so we

724
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,799
it was not in the design document it was

725
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,400
not anywhere

726
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
anyway it was this giant hole into their

727
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,799
network and i would never have found

728
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,960
that because it wasn't in the scope of

729
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,559
my pen test and that little one question

730
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
uh save them a lot of heartache let's

731
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
just say

732
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,880
secure

733
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
architecture so this can just be

734
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
whiteboarding out your design and saying

735
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,480
so is there encryption there

736
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
how do you know do you just have implied

737
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,080
trust here like do you authenticate do

738
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,679
you authorize like what's going on there

739
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,000
how do you know who you're talking to

740
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,159
a bunch of simple questions can lead to

741
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,880
changes in architecture and design

742
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
before anything is built and you just

743
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,840
saved yourself a zillion dollars

744
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
code review

745
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
oh yes if you can have all of your

746
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,640
security champions review pull requests

747
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,600
for like five different secure things

748
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,159
you will save yourself so much time how

749
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,559
to fix security bugs they find

750
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,279
like you want to refresh some sort of

751
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,039
security training for these folks at

752
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,600
least once a year because one things

753
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,840
change two people forget and three you

754
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
hire new people

755
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
so you want to refresh this at least

756
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
once every year i work somewhere once

757
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,320
and they're like we gave them secure

758
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,760
code training i don't know what the

759
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,159
problem was and it was 2017 and i was

760
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,440
like when did you give the training and

761
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,200
they said 2012 and i said so yeah

762
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,080
when are we gonna plan their training

763
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,200
okay so other topics your policies so i

764
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
know that policy standards and

765
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,360
guidelines can be boring

766
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,960
so it is your job to try to make them

767
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,840
less

768
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,000
boring

769
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,919
so the policies and standards and

770
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,880
guidelines that apply to them

771
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,559
so if you have a secure coding guideline

772
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,760
or standard

773
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,120
they should know it like the back of

774
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,720
their hand and it should not be 87 pages

775
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,600
it should be two pages or five pages and

776
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,159
it should be reasonable

777
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,880
help them create missing guidelines so i

778
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
consult at this american company like

779
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
once a week and i have been for years

780
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
and

781
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
i love working there anyway like

782
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,480
whenever someone's like hey well i'm

783
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
gonna build this serverless thing me and

784
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,440
the other people were like let's build a

785
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,679
serverless best practices guide yeah

786
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,120
okay let's do it

787
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
because then they have guidance from us

788
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,799
immediately and every new project that

789
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,880
does serverless has this guidance and we

790
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,399
can get feedback from them and make it

791
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,640
better and it's just this awesome it is

792
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,960
a circle of awesome

793
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,360
teach them how to be compliant

794
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
help them get there

795
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,880
a thing that you might not be aware of

796
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,080
is every time that you release um

797
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,159
every time you release like a secure

798
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,880
guideline or standard there are people

799
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
that are in charge of a bunch of legacy

800
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,399
apps and some of them will be nervous

801
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
that they will lose their job

802
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,480
inform them no one's getting fired right

803
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,080
at the beginning this is not a stick

804
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
that i plan to beat you into

805
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,440
unemployment with

806
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
this is

807
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,559
a line in the sand that i want us to all

808
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,480
strive towards getting to and i will

809
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,960
help you get there and when you say that

810
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
a bunch of people will be like

811
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,399
oh

812
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,399
so no one's getting fired that's a

813
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,320
really it sounds so silly and you're

814
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,240
like oh would anyone think that trust me

815
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
at least one person's thinking that

816
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,360
and very very important

817
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,679
their role during a security incident

818
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,000
what to do what not to do please don't

819
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
ruin the chain of custody please call us

820
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,760
don't handle it yourself yay

821
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,279
shadowing is a great way to teach them

822
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,919
this so if you want them to review code

823
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,600
have them job shadow you while you

824
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,159
review code one day

825
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,399
hold consultations and get the advice of

826
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,919
your amazing champions they are

827
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,320
brilliant they are smart they have the

828
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,840
knowledge you want

829
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
so always consult these amazing geniuses

830
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,320
that you have made this team with

831
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,360
so more

832
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,480
topics tooling

833
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,799
training on custom tools that custom

834
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,559
training on tools if you expect them to

835
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,399
use a thing teach them how to use it

836
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,320
teach them what the output means teach

837
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
them how to validate the results teach

838
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,399
them how to install and configure the

839
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,120
tools teach them to select the best

840
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,679
tools help them select them do lunch and

841
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,760
learns or hackathons where they just use

842
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,799
the tool a lot so they get comfortable

843
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,399
okay so

844
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,200
coaching is a style of teaching so i

845
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,760
feel the kitty needs a lifesaver i think

846
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,279
that makes sense

847
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,279
so coaching

848
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,000
coaching means enabling individuals to

849
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
reach their full potential it means

850
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,039
facilitating

851
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,880
the way that they learn to help them

852
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,799
make lasting change and what we want

853
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,399
them to change

854
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,720
is their attitude and their knowledge

855
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,440
around security if we want them to be

856
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,760
practicing a secure system development

857
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
life cycle we need to support them and

858
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,159
if we want our champions to sing our

859
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,919
pray our praises and evangelize

860
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,240
our message we need to reinforce that

861
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,080
with them all the time we need to

862
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,399
support them we need to coach them and

863
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,000
so

864
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
there's the kitty

865
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,840
so for champions we can set up office

866
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,919
hours we can set up repeat meetings with

867
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,159
them we can help prioritize their

868
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,880
security bugs or activities we need to

869
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
be available whenever

870
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,279
we can for them we need to help them set

871
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,440
goals and then achieve those goals and

872
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,919
teach them specific tools or trainings

873
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,880
and ask them what they need from us and

874
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,720
then whenever we can we provide it

875
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,919
okay a special note on delegation

876
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,760
something should not be your

877
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,159
responsibility as the security person it

878
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,919
is not your responsibility to fix all

879
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,279
the security bugs to update the

880
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,159
frameworks to plan releases to sign bugs

881
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,919
to run every scan to implement every

882
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,159
single tool to write the unit tests the

883
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,480
list is endless

884
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,120
delegate when you can

885
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,760
don't delegate some things short list of

886
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
what not to ever delegate do not

887
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,159
delegate validating

888
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
results from a sas tool unless you've

889
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,320
given them extensive training

890
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,840
every place i've seen has been a

891
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,679
disaster

892
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,760
giving security approval on anything

893
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,320
that's not their job no

894
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,559
using new tools without proper training

895
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,039
nope training new champions nope those

896
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,840
are always yours never give that away do

897
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,760
not delegate that is your responsibility

898
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,840
you keep that so we are looking for a

899
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,279
partnership we don't want them to

900
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,720
replace us

901
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,799
um i'm not worried about job security

902
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,880
for security folks if you work hard

903
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
you're qualified you show up for work

904
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,039
you're going to be just fine and this

905
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,880
it is like impossible to hire security

906
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
people but don't give those

907
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,039
responsibilities away those need to be

908
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,320
our team

909
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,519
okay so

910
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,399
there are two types of ways to reinforce

911
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,080
and make them feel good for being

912
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,640
champions and one is recognition

913
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
and one is rewarding so one's like

914
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
monetary and one's like social i am the

915
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
social type if you tell me i've done a

916
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,200
good job i'm like oh my gosh it's the

917
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,159
best i'd rather that than like a 50 gift

918
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,320
certificate i am like so

919
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,200
intrinsically motivated by praise and so

920
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,960
people tend to fall into one of two

921
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,679
categories and so whichever one you

922
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,080
could like whichever one they are if you

923
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,320
can identify it do that more with them

924
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
but otherwise just do both with everyone

925
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
and you will get good results

926
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,679
so it's important to recognize your

927
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,799
champions

928
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,399
we want them to know they're doing a

929
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,640
good job and not feel like they're just

930
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,799
trying really hard to do two jobs but

931
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
they only receive one paycheck like this

932
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,519
kitty

933
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,320
so

934
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,880
there's only two kitties in this i so i

935
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,240
hope you like this one she doesn't have

936
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,000
a lifesaver she's trying to do two jobs

937
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,360
for one paycheck

938
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,440
sorry i like cats

939
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,200
okay so recognize

940
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
let's create a certificate and put it on

941
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,360
their wall it sounds cheesy i have seen

942
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,519
so many places where people have this

943
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,440
certificate on their look at that i have

944
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
a certificate on my wall and i have

945
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,559
another one i'm supposed to put up just

946
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,840
keep it there forever because you're

947
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,120
like yeah that's right i earned that

948
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,039
recognize them in front of their peers

949
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,200
in any way you can so this can mean

950
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
giving them a special virtual background

951
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,320
that says i am a security champion

952
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,399
put a star on their name in slack or

953
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,200
teams whatever chat you use

954
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,799
make sure

955
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,440
make sure to put a note in their

956
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,039
performance review

957
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,799
that says that they're a champion and

958
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,200
that they did hard work very important

959
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,039
don't miss this

960
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,120
tell their boss every single time they

961
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,720
do something that makes a big difference

962
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,000
tell their boss

963
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
send them an email to tell them you saw

964
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,720
this awesome thing they did and they

965
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
and thank them for it show gratitude

966
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,320
gratitude is kind of magical because

967
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
when you give gratitude to someone else

968
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,079
you get to feel good and they get to

969
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,079
feel good it's awesome

970
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,639
and

971
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,320
make their role on their team clear to

972
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,079
their peers like whenever you have an

973
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,839
all staff like maybe give a shout out to

974
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,239
all your security champions

975
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,440
um oh yes i like i don't have too many

976
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
memes but i really do like the most

977
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,199
interesting man in the world

978
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,719
okay so now

979
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,079
reward we want to reward them so

980
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,599
i've been reading all these parenting

981
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,960
books because i am a step mom now and so

982
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,560
this is like a big change for me i never

983
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,399
had kids before it's like reading like a

984
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
zillion books because that's what i do

985
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,239
i like research things and a thing it

986
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,159
said for adults and for children for

987
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,480
everyone reinforce good behavior instead

988
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
of punishing bad behavior you will get

989
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,280
better results so

990
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,800
reward

991
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,000
anything that's good so give them a

992
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,839
security related gift this is the best

993
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,520
because you get a double whammy you've

994
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
rewarded them but you've also reinforced

995
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
security stuff

996
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,280
so buy them a book i have a bunch of

997
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,800
books that i'm going to recommend mostly

998
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,720
mine

999
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,280
giving them your time as a reward

1000
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
a lot of people their love language like

1001
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,079
the way that they experience

1002
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,400
goodness from other people is like time

1003
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,480
so give them time and attention it

1004
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,079
sounds so silly but if someone comes to

1005
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,400
your desk stop typing what you're doing

1006
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,119
and move your body towards them and look

1007
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,960
directly at them

1008
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
that makes a huge difference it shows

1009
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
them like you're my 100 priority right

1010
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,320
now and it shows respect and it makes

1011
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
people feel good

1012
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
help them with more than just security

1013
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,839
like i've been a dev forever so it's

1014
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,960
like yeah do you want me to help you

1015
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
architect that even if it's not security

1016
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,440
like i've got an hour let's do this

1017
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
let them see everything new first

1018
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,079
everything reasonably you can let them

1019
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,160
help you make decisions one these people

1020
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,640
are super smart experts in their field

1021
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,880
and know lots of stuff and two it will

1022
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,839
make them feel valued

1023
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,240
okay anything else you can think of

1024
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,839
anything that is okay where you work

1025
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,400
like it might be buying ice cream it

1026
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,240
sounds so silly but if it's a thing that

1027
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
makes them feel valued it was worth

1028
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,359
doing

1029
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,720
okay last don't stop

1030
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,960
when endo over communicate so let's say

1031
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
it's december so there are three major

1032
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
religious holidays at least in december

1033
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,520
so there's like ramadan hanukkah and

1034
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,359
christmas that's a lot of religious

1035
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,359
holidays why people take time off in

1036
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,200
december that's cool

1037
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,079
send an email out and wish everyone you

1038
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,640
know a happy december and or whatever

1039
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,720
religious holiday they celebrate and say

1040
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,240
we're not going to have you know any

1041
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,079
lunch and learns this month but i wanted

1042
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,000
to wish you all like a great month and

1043
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
if you're celebrating something i hope

1044
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,280
it's totally awesome and here's a

1045
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,560
podcast that i listened to on the

1046
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,240
weekend about this and i thought might

1047
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
be interesting for you we are going to

1048
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,400
have a lunch and learn in january on

1049
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
this i haven't picked a date yet

1050
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,599
see y'all then

1051
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,079
just that email to just touch base

1052
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,640
reminds them you still exist

1053
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,280
don't stop communicating because it will

1054
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,720
disappear

1055
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,560
it'll disappear so fast it's like it

1056
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,240
just evaporates

1057
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,000
and it's just consistency is key even if

1058
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,599
you just meet with them once a month to

1059
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,720
check in

1060
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,480
some champions will need more attention

1061
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,640
and time than others and some will give

1062
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,760
you more than others and that's okay you

1063
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,920
can't expect a pluses from everyone and

1064
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
that's okay even a security champion

1065
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
that does the bare minimum is way better

1066
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,599
than no champion

1067
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,200
if you have accidentally dropped your

1068
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,000
schedule start again start again as soon

1069
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,760
as you can even if it's just an email to

1070
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,040
tell them that you're starting it the

1071
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,400
next month

1072
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
culture is a practice like yoga like

1073
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,280
meditation you have to continue to do it

1074
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,520
self-care all those things if you just

1075
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,599
like stop cutting your nails before you

1076
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,040
know you're gonna have like those weird

1077
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,599
long really huge nails where you can't

1078
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,200
do anything useful i don't mean pretty

1079
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
nails that women have but like you know

1080
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,960
where they're out of hand it's like you

1081
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,640
have to continue to cut your nails or

1082
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,880
they become a mess is the same as that

1083
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,520
with your security program and it will

1084
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,480
fall apart faster than you think so be

1085
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,880
careful do not stop

1086
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,960
so this is the recipe we followed and

1087
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,359
we're totally awesome

1088
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,160
and so in conclusion we learned how to

1089
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,880
attract the right people to your program

1090
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,359
what to teach them how to reach them how

1091
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,440
to engage with them how to turn them

1092
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,880
into your advocates what to delegate

1093
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,359
what not to delegate except i put do

1094
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,760
instead of two how to motivate them how

1095
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,000
to build an amazing security champions

1096
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,440
program

1097
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,000
our this was our recipe

1098
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
and now i have some free resources

1099
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,720
because i totally have one minute and

1100
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,400
two seconds left

1101
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
resources

1102
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,800
okay so awesome books so obviously i

1103
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
think my book is probably the best book

1104
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,079
if you want to learn application

1105
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,400
security but there's so many awesome

1106
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,640
books and if you're working in some

1107
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,960
other area of security that's okay

1108
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,680
but

1109
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,359
