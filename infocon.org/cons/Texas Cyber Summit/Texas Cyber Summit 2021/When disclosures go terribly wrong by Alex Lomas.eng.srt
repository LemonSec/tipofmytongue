1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,319
hi there i'm alex i work for apprentice

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,920
partners in the uk

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,400
i lead up our aerospace research and

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,240
client testing work but i'll be talking

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,440
to you about something completely

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,719
different today

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,240
um which is the

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
previous implications of the use of

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
location in dating apps

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,720
and it's something called teledildonics

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,640
um as seen through the lens of trying to

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
disclose some pretty important privacy

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
issues to various vendors

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
and just to say up front um there's no

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,040
negativity but we're discussing kind of

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,360
adult things so your caution is advised

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
if you're watching this with your kids

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,840
or if you're out in public somewhere or

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
your workspace isn't awesome or

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,320
something

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,960
um i'd also like to say at the start um

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,480
that the purpose of

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,200
mine and my company's research is

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
not to kink shame anyone

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
online dating is the norm now and users

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
of these apps and devices deserve the

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
same protection as someone using for

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
example

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
a banking application

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,000
as we see later there are coordinated

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
disclosures with other researchers in

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,159
this space and i'd urge you to reach out

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799
and get assistance if you found an issue

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,799
but you're not getting any joy

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,000
um

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,119
from from the vendors

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,840
so back in 2019 a colleague and i

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
started to look at dating apps and i

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,159
call this view of my test phone at the

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
time my screen of loneliness

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
we wanted to see if there are any common

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,720
good or bad things about dating apps

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,759
and

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,840
although just because an app is listed

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479
on my screen of loneliness

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,000
it doesn't necessarily indicate that we

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,720
found anything specifically good or bad

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
it's just to show that you know there

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
are a lot of the time and many of them

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
are actually clones of each other

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
um made by the same makers just with

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
different brandings and targeting

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
different demographics

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,439
and one of the things that we

55
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,000
kind of really picked up on um

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,399
and was the use of at the time anyway

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
the the facebook sdk

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,719
which was used for both

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,440
metrics but for sign-in as well um

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
through the the facebook account kit sdk

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
um this was a service where you could

62
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
just provide a telephone number or an

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
email address and

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
that did some magic behind the scenes to

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
try and determine whether you were a

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
real human being or not

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
and then allow you to sign into these

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,400
services

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
now that service was removed by facebook

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,680
in 2020

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
but in grinder's case um and this is a

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,239
screenshot from some of its

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,640
communication at the time was we found

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
that it was sending your exact location

75
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
off to braze which is an ad platform

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,800
and that location is down to six decimal

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
places that's more than enough to

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
identify

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,239
an individual house even

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,200
so

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
even if you posit the

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,239
the dating app itself is secure um the

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,920
fact that your location is being sent

84
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,560
off to ad and metrics platforms

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
um you know might cause you issue if

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,000
they were compromised

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
and we'll see a potential implication

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
of locations being sent to advertisers

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,599
later

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,560
now many of these dating apps um work by

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
giving you back um a list of profiles in

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,720
your or your neighborhood

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,840
and

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
they usually order that set of profile

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,519
names by by distance um which is your

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
location of your phone at that time and

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
i guess the idea is that you can see who

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,200
is nearby

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
um but most of these

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
apps they take the location from your

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,519
phone and then

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,280
turn that into a latitude and longitude

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,840
as we saw with with praise

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,519
and then they basically just supply that

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,239
to an api endpoint and the api then

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,799
responds back with a bunch of profiles

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,080
and often

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,840
um

109
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,439
distances um often quite accurate

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,080
distances back to each of those profiles

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
now what we can do

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,799
is if we

113
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,840
um

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
interact directly with that api and we

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,760
spoof our location

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
we can get distances back to a given

117
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
profile

118
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
for each of our spoof locations and if

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
we do that three times

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
where the three circles overlap is where

121
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
our target profile user is not not us

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,240
but

123
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
an individual

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
and because we've seen with the level of

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
accuracy that phones um will respond

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,919
with location with

127
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
this will often give us again an

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,600
individual house

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
now when i was testing

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,440
testing triangulation um i found i could

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
actually determine whether i was at

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
different ends of my house

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
even though that sort of gps indoors so

134
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
the accuracy is is really quite specific

135
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,160
now

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
i can kind of hear you say well you know

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
what the risks of knowing a dating app

138
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
profiles um

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
location

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,560
and

141
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
some of our um dating apps that we

142
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
looked at at the time um

143
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
have a sort of niche market in

144
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,440
bdsm and fetishes

145
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,680
now even in the uk

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
um doctors nurses and social workers

147
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
have actually been dismissed from their

148
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
employment for what they actually get up

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
to in private that's obviously

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
completely wrong but that it has been

151
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
held the case in the uk

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
and even in the u.s you can definitely

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
be dismissed for being gay or whatever

154
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,400
in in some states so being outed as a

155
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
user of these apps

156
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,680
certainly carries

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,560
some risk if if you can unmask an

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,919
individual

159
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,840
now really recently

160
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,360
um this story appeared around um a

161
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
priest being outed as a grinder user

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
um there are some gaps in the story but

163
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
um one of the suggestions anyway was

164
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
that ad brokers

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
are reselling people's location data

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
which is then being exploited by other

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,479
websites and services downstream for

168
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
more nefarious purposes

169
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
and as we saw earlier braze at least at

170
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,919
the time um was given your exact

171
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
location by grinder so there is

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
definitely a potential route from our

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,199
use of apps to do anonymization just by

174
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,360
virtue of where we hang out and visit

175
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,919
and work

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
i know it's a bit of a

177
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
trope

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,199
within cyber security

179
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,840
but nation state risks to individuals

180
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
using the nation's state risks to

181
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
individuals isn't his apps

182
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,759
in certain countries is literally a

183
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,080
matter of life and death so

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
you can imagine that

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
governments in these parts of the world

186
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
would actually start to look at and

187
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
exploit some of these vulnerabilities

188
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,560
um because they're horrible people

189
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,440
um

190
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
then obviously

191
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
you know you you have stalkers and exes

192
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,720
people who feel

193
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
spurned and jilted for whatever reason

194
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
um and these apps can be used to you

195
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
know find where people live or you know

196
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,479
track someone in in near real time

197
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,240
there's definitely be a fair number of

198
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,280
incidents where criminals have used um

199
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
grindr to rob people

200
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,400
um

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
at this point there's no evidence that

202
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
using these exploits to locate someone

203
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,599
has been used it's more that um they

204
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,840
have found

205
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,400
their victims um on

206
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
grindr and other similar services to

207
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
arrange a meeting and then ambush them

208
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,680
at that meeting

209
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
um but you could definitely see that you

210
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
know if you had been in someone's home

211
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,759
and you had seen there was something of

212
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,160
high value in that home you could use

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
dating apps to

214
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,400
work out whether they were away in a

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
different country or something like that

216
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,360
so

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,479
you know

218
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
protecting people's location is

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,919
definitely something really important

220
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
that dating services need to

221
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
embrace for a multitude of reasons

222
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
now back at defcon 27 in 2019

223
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
myself and my colleague had

224
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,599
written a tool and we demoed it and that

225
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,639
exploited the triangulation issues

226
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,560
um in grinder

227
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,440
recon uh gave romeo and another app

228
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,199
called threefun

229
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,080
and we presented this into a single map

230
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
view the

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
in worked in in near real time and

232
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
because of the number of users of these

233
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,958
apps it was basically the location um of

234
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
10 million people

235
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,519
which is quite terrifying

236
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,479
um this is a view of central london and

237
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
uk at the time of our research back in

238
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,839
2019 um each app is

239
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
color coded different colors so grinder

240
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,959
is yellow

241
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,360
recon is red for example

242
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,600
and you know this is just a screenshot

243
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
that we took at the time

244
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
um but you could zoom in and out you can

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,320
click on an individual

246
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
map pin and find out everything about

247
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
that user their pictures all that kind

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
of stuff

249
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
it was really really scary

250
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
we actually destroyed all of our data

251
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
and our code um shortly after we went

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
public and some of the app

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,519
vendors fixed their vulnerabilities

254
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,959
we could literally track individual

255
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
users as they went around their days

256
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
from home to work to the gym

257
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
who they were meeting even

258
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
you know and with additional information

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
like

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,480
their profile pictures and people even

261
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,360
included social media links or instagram

262
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
um the perhaps often give gave you

263
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,240
birthdays and it really wouldn't have

264
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
been difficult to completely

265
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,160
de-anonymize um someone or even a lot of

266
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,120
people

267
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,959
um in bulk

268
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,200
now moving on to disclosures

269
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,320
um the first app that we contacted was

270
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
okay romeo and you know it's still

271
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,519
common um with many sites and apps um

272
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
even today that there was no explicit

273
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,800
mention

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,959
about security on their website or their

275
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,720
faqs

276
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,880
so we ended up having to go to their

277
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
sort of

278
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,480
central support team who perhaps are not

279
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
necessarily

280
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
briefed or expecting

281
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
disclosures of security issues

282
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
they did respond um and they they

283
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
pointed us

284
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,800
an faq on their website

285
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
um which talks about how to

286
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
mask your position

287
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,200
um and it is absolutely true within the

288
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
app you can actually choose a position

289
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,880
of of your choosing um

290
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,959
so you you you're not necessarily

291
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
visible um at home or work for example

292
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,120
however that option is is buried it's

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,399
not default

294
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,680
um and because it's not default your

295
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
exact location

296
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
um is leaked

297
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,279
at least once so if you're going to use

298
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,000
go romeo i guess open it up first away

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
from where you are

300
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
um

301
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
they said they wouldn't fix um

302
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,959
this triangulation um issue

303
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,160
um because partly that would cause them

304
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
work because people wouldn't be reported

305
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,959
um where they thought they would be and

306
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
which i thought was a pretty

307
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,120
poor response

308
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,160
um

309
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,360
recon were great um they they handled

310
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
these issues really well throughout

311
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,399
um

312
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,240
they came up

313
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
and implemented a solution that we um

314
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
spoke um with us

315
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,839
between us

316
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
um and basically they have a sort of a

317
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,120
snap to grid um style solution so your

318
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
your actual location is

319
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,480
um moved to a sort of a more granular

320
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,320
less granular grid

321
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,399
um and they are

322
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
no longer ingesting um locations to so

323
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,399
many

324
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,880
decimal places

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,800
most of the clients with

326
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,639
the attacks that we've looked at so far

327
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,160
are all kind of

328
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,480
client-facing and apis being used in the

329
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
way that they are intended

330
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,279
um but if the server actually stores

331
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
that precise location anyway

332
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
um then

333
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,680
you've both got um you know the threat

334
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,560
of the the server being exploited um or

335
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,480
for a malicious insider to you know

336
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
still extract all of those locations so

337
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,680
um but kudos to recon they handle these

338
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,560
issues really really well

339
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
um grinder worked pretty poor um

340
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
complete radio silence they they didn't

341
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,399
respond to disclosure

342
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,639
um to be fair this is probably the

343
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
second or third time that they've been

344
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
told and by different researchers as it

345
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,079
turns out about these issues

346
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,000
um

347
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
so yeah it's it's maybe not surprising

348
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,519
that they're not treating it as a new

349
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,480
issue

350
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
um but we felt with the ease of what we

351
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
could demonstrate that maybe they would

352
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
take notice

353
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,399
um to be fair to them they do redact

354
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
location in countries with poor human

355
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,959
rights records like in the middle east

356
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,880
so that is at least

357
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,240
a good thing

358
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
um

359
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
they do say again you can kind of hide

360
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
your location but you can actually infer

361
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,240
a distance

362
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,800
due to the ordering position in a list

363
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
so

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
it's it's still a bit of a problem and

365
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,639
again it's it's a non-default buried

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,519
option

367
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,000
um we did eventually get blocked for

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
making a lot of api requests

369
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
um until we paid for grinder extra then

370
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
everything was fine again

371
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,399
um and then they did end up blocking our

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,880
company ip address rangers so

373
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720
um they obviously

374
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800
kind of knew we were there but didn't

375
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,839
chose

376
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,800
chose not to respond

377
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
now

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
3fun was an absolute dumpster fire of an

379
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,279
app um they were quicker quicker

380
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,120
replying to be fair to them

381
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,079
um but but the underlying app was really

382
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,199
really really bad

383
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
so this is an extract of some of the

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
data that is

385
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,760
returned with refund we don't even need

386
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,079
to use this triangulation trick because

387
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,839
their apis

388
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,399
just return the exact location of

389
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,040
another user

390
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,120
and then the app does the computation to

391
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
work out the distance on the client side

392
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,519
um if you

393
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,680
chose to hide

394
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,320
your location which was an option

395
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,040
all i did was set a flag um in the api

396
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,639
which meant the client

397
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
um app on your phone

398
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,720
um would just hide the distance that the

399
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,880
distance was still returned in every

400
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,199
single response if you even if you chose

401
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,560
not to hide it

402
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,600
um

403
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
so it gave us quite a lot of information

404
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
as well as young people's full dates of

405
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,199
birth

406
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,680
and urls to

407
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
photos that were meant to be kept

408
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,560
private so often in dating apps you have

409
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
public

410
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,399
photos that maybe are reducted don't

411
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
show your face and then when you

412
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,600
you know end up chatting with someone

413
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
then you can share um

414
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,199
more private pictures of your face and

415
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
whatever which is sensible but in this

416
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
case returning the url to someone's

417
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,199
private pictures um in the api was not

418
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
ideal

419
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,680
because

420
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,199
what i ended up doing was giving

421
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,839
people's places or genitals or both

422
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,040
we've obviously

423
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,240
pixelated

424
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,360
but

425
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,320
given location um a picture

426
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,680
date of birth

427
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
um that all of this is plenty enough to

428
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
to anonymize someone

429
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
um they they weren't great in in

430
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
responding or that they were quick

431
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,920
they didn't you know inspire confidence

432
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,399
in being able to remediate issues

433
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,800
um you know worst of all

434
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
if you want to delete your account and

435
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
your data and they actually end up

436
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,279
holding onto it for for six months

437
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,199
and that's definitely not great so three

438
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,480
fun were

439
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,360
um

440
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,440
given the nature of the the platform and

441
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,279
their users um

442
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,759
not a great response

443
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,399
so this brings us up a bit more um to

444
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,000
date um which is

445
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
um some research we disclosed late last

446
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,440
year

447
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
um which is the the summary

448
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
um and

449
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,399
the soulmate is a bluetooth just a

450
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,800
decage which has a companion mobile

451
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
application so

452
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
bluntly

453
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,759
um you can lock up someone's check

454
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,079
and the idea is that you can give

455
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,920
control over the locking unlocking to

456
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,440
someone remotely

457
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,279
and this has definitely seen an increase

458
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,480
in popularity with the global pandemic

459
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
um you know not being able to see people

460
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,399
and such and and the idea is a positive

461
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,560
one and there have been many

462
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
teledildonics apps over the years like

463
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
the lovense for example

464
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,320
and being able to stay connected and

465
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,160
play with your partner even when you're

466
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,399
apart um is definitely a really

467
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,360
important

468
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,120
innovation now more than ever

469
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,160
but

470
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,639
what i really quickly found with the

471
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,319
soundwave mobile app because it had no

472
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,559
authentication of any kind

473
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,000
and it suffered from an accounts

474
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
numeration issue

475
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,280
because users

476
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
were as we'll see were identified only

477
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
by a six digit number

478
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,400
um

479
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
with that number you could retrieve

480
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,439
people's

481
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,079
passwords their exact location all their

482
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,839
private messages and kind of

483
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,039
interestingly

484
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
you could lock people in or out of their

485
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
devices

486
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,200
now some might see that as a feature

487
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
um but i definitely think you still need

488
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
to have opt-in consent for that kind of

489
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,679
behavior and that was the point of the

490
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,120
app after all

491
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,919
um disclosure was really very difficult

492
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,320
and the maker eventually ignored pretty

493
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,799
much all of our communications and we

494
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,960
really struggled with the ethics of what

495
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
to do

496
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
the vulnerability was so

497
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
trivial to find

498
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
but at the same time if we went public

499
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,200
then it might be quickly exploited

500
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
so we decided to kind of sit on it

501
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
um then we were contacted by two other

502
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,679
researchers who'd independently found

503
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,600
the same problem

504
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
and we're not giving them vendor and

505
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
ultimatum and then issuing heavily

506
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
redacted blog posts

507
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,799
and it gained quite a lot of press

508
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,400
attention

509
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
a few days later the vendor did fix the

510
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
issues but by this point people were

511
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
receiving messages

512
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,360
asking for ransoms

513
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,679
although it wasn't really clear

514
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,280
whether

515
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,200
the vendor had been breached or not

516
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
um they were terribly uncommunicative

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,480
and ended up posting poorly worded press

518
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,120
releases then reducting them

519
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
just terrible customer services all

520
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,760
around

521
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,720
um

522
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,440
they've since launched a kind of really

523
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
stripped down app without many of the

524
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,520
original social features

525
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,120
let's dive into this a little bit more

526
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,000
and

527
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
see where the problem was so the exploit

528
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
was trivial um

529
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,679
this is pretty much the the request

530
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
um you can see that there is

531
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,720
um

532
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
no authentication header of any kind

533
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
there's no cookies there's no bearer

534
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,559
token that there's there's nothing

535
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,520
um so what you can do is you can search

536
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,600
um for this six digit incrementing

537
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
number and that returns a huge wealth of

538
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
personal and sensitive information

539
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,200
um this isn't all of it but

540
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
phone numbers locations

541
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,039
birthdays

542
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,520
lots more all these are completely

543
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,960
authenticated um but inexplicably this

544
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
request returns a user's plain text

545
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
password

546
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
um in in the same response so

547
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,039
if people have reused that password

548
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,679
which you know people do and with that

549
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,160
email address or that phone number um

550
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
you know it's

551
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,760
easy to pivot into other services

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
so once we have

553
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,720
searched and found a user

554
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,080
um subsequent requests use a longer more

555
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,640
complex number this this member code um

556
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,400
it's kind of loosely based around the

557
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,240
date that you join so it definitely

558
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,880
could be brute force as well but the

559
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
um the six digit

560
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,360
uh

561
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,080
short number returns this longer member

562
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,440
code anyway

563
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,799
um so it's not really a major hindrance

564
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,840
um

565
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
so once we have this longer code we can

566
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
make this request for example which

567
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,080
gives us all of the some of my lock

568
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
devices associated to

569
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
to that user

570
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
we can also then find out again using

571
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,240
that member code and devices associated

572
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,200
with them

573
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,440
what permissions someone has over that

574
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
device

575
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,520
and

576
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,600
part of the app was that there was a

577
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
social

578
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
um area

579
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
message board kind of thing

580
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,880
um so whereas of the the physical device

581
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
could find virtual key holders

582
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,039
um and then give up control to them or

583
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,720
maybe they could set a

584
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
certain duration

585
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
and that they wanted to remain locked

586
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
and so forth

587
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
and this was an interesting actual

588
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
revenue stream for some people to

589
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,240
provide this

590
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,760
virtual key holding service

591
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
now if a user had control over their own

592
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,679
device you know maybe they're just

593
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,200
playing it with them with themselves

594
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,000
all we have to do is make this request

595
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
um again completely unauthenticated all

596
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,480
it needs is um the the longer code which

597
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,640
we can find italy and the device again

598
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,720
found really easily and we just make

599
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200
this request and we can switch it

600
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,159
so that user can no longer unlock their

601
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,440
device

602
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,559
and this is

603
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,480
what you would see next time you logged

604
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,039
into your app to unlock your device

605
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,640
um you would be greeted with this hard

606
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,720
stopping error that someone has changed

607
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,559
permissions and you're no longer allowed

608
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,200
to unlock your device i think it would

609
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,080
be

610
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,440
quite terrifying to to see that

611
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
and the hardware itself was a little

612
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,919
bluetooth device with a battery that

613
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,480
connects to this mobile app as most sort

614
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
of consumer iot is these days

615
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
and if we explored the bluetooth um

616
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,720
characteristics with um freedom and if

617
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,200
we decompiled the app um it showed us

618
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
something really interesting

619
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,360
in

620
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
these bluetooth characteristics and and

621
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
the way that

622
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
um it obtains an unlock code from the

623
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,679
servers

624
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,960
and actually

625
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,600
this device is pretty much identical to

626
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,559
the note clock um this is a

627
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,080
traditional padlock

628
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,640
and the um we at pentas partners have

629
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,320
looked at before

630
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,200
and

631
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,640
each padlock has an unlock key

632
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
an encryption key basically which is

633
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,080
stored server-side

634
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,159
um so unfortunately there is no way to

635
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,960
create your own app to issue a magic

636
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,799
unlock code or anything

637
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,840
you have to interact with the vendors

638
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,720
servers to get this unlocked code and

639
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,159
you can read a bit more about no clock

640
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,000
from tablock on our blog if you're

641
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
interested

642
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,960
um but it is effectively the same

643
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,280
hardware and same behavior under just

644
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,360
kind of in a different package

645
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,640
and that's true for a lot of these iot

646
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
padlock devices they're all kind of

647
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,520
very

648
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,840
reference nordic semiconductor

649
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,959
designs under the lid

650
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,400
i don't really want to go through the

651
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,159
whole disclosure timeline you're welcome

652
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,640
to pause and read it at your leisure um

653
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
they did

654
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,120
respond to us quite quickly initially

655
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,600
but after the initial disclosure they

656
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
they just

657
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
stopped responding and

658
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,400
we were in this huge dilemma catch 22.

659
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,360
if we simply let our standard

660
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,799
90 days elapse and publish

661
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,360
and they haven't fixed it then bad

662
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
people will

663
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,400
probably find and exploit the

664
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,279
vulnerabilities eventually

665
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,919
as we might normally do which is demand

666
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,360
a vendor take down the vulnerable apis

667
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,039
whilst they fix them

668
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,159
and then

669
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,640
issue new mobile applications

670
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
then people will be stuck locked in

671
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
their devices anyway remember that they

672
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
need the mobile app and they need

673
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,039
um the servers to be able to get that

674
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,320
unlock

675
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
code

676
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,520
to get out

677
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
or if they do issue a new version if

678
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,520
people don't update their mobile app in

679
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
time or

680
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
maybe something

681
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
happens during the upgrade process

682
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
and

683
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,640
their details are lost then potentially

684
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,720
they're locked in

685
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
we tried lots of different avenues to

686
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,880
try and get response

687
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
from

688
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,559
using journalists

689
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,320
um contacting

690
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
retailers and escalating it through

691
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,760
through wholesalers um but

692
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
they they just didn't respond

693
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,279
um

694
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,200
we basically resigned ourselves to to

695
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,440
not disclosing it um as that was the the

696
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
least bad option that we felt at the

697
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,240
time

698
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,720
um if you know we've done everything we

699
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
possibly can at this stage we've told

700
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
them

701
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,039
um you know

702
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,880
okay let's not make it easy for people

703
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,640
to find the vulnerability by by talking

704
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,320
about it but

705
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,840
something will probably be found in the

706
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,320
future but you know we've at least done

707
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
our part

708
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,799
but

709
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,240
um

710
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,360
towards the end of the year basically in

711
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,080
september october last year

712
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,880
um we were actually contacted by two

713
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
other researchers

714
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
um who had found the same issues

715
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,159
completely independently

716
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,440
and at that point we knew we really had

717
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,559
a little

718
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,039
choice now but but to disclose in a

719
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,520
coordinated way this was the tipping

720
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
point for us um because we thought the

721
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
secret is out there

722
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
bad people are going to find this

723
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,880
sooner

724
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
rather than later now if two other

725
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,559
people have completely stumbled across

726
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,440
this

727
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
um and

728
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,360
the better option was to

729
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,320
um

730
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,440
issue a joint um statement um from all

731
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
three researchers

732
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,120
um and to tell the vendor they've got

733
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,039
you know one last chance

734
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,080
um

735
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,919
you know otherwise we're gonna have to

736
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,080
you know go go public so that people can

737
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,919
start to take steps to

738
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,880
protect themselves

739
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,320
unfortunately

740
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
they were too slow

741
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,360
and

742
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
um

743
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,760
we published and within a couple of days

744
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,080
people started receiving these kinds of

745
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
messages um

746
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
in the apps

747
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,679
basically ransomware

748
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,200
um

749
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
although they had issued new

750
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
applications and apis

751
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,279
which is good um

752
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,960
they had left the old ones up behind the

753
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
scenes um

754
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,360
they were found i guess by people

755
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,159
finding all versions of the android apk

756
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,360
and and people started to get um demands

757
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,840
for for money for ransom

758
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,640
um

759
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,400
that amount of bitcoin at the time was

760
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
about a thousand dollars it's a crazy

761
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
amount

762
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,760
um

763
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,240
the vendor finally took action um they

764
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
took down the whole service they they

765
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,480
failed open all devices

766
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,520
um

767
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
they even rolled everything back um

768
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,880
several days in time at one stage

769
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,159
their responses were definitely not

770
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,200
great um users were really left in in

771
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,360
the dark as to the extent

772
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,039
people didn't know what personal

773
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,039
information had been stolen and possibly

774
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,159
still don't

775
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,480
um you know was this someone chancing

776
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,799
their arm was it a real ransomware

777
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,840
attack

778
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,679
um

779
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,360
it was definitely not ideal

780
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,120
we heard

781
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,760
mentioned in our blog post

782
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
a way to

783
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
get out of the device

784
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,799
if you had to

785
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,679
and

786
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,840
because this is kind of right next to

787
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,520
really sensitive parts

788
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,159
we felt that advising people to use

789
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,279
knives or saws or bob cutters or things

790
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,399
like that

791
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,960
um what was definitely not ideal

792
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,039
so i'd found a way to

793
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,159
what is called spike the motor

794
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,520
and

795
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,000
the the unlocking mechanism is just

796
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,200
a bar held in by a solenoid

797
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,360
um and if you just applied five volts to

798
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
the white and the yellow wire this would

799
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,640
be enough to

800
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,120
um kind of blip the motor release the

801
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,360
locking pin and url

802
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,120
um so this was the way that we kind of

803
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,399
suggested

804
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,720
was an option you know people could

805
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,960
probably find um the right numbers of

806
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,200
batteries and some wires to kind of

807
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,960
cobble it together and we felt it was

808
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
the safest way

809
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,679
and that people could extricate

810
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,279
themselves if they were kind of stuck in

811
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,000
um the vendor themselves then started to

812
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
downplay the whole thing and issued a

813
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,840
really weird video

814
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,640
um where they showed how to break out of

815
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
of the device by kind of just levering

816
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,039
it with a screwdriver

817
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,679
um there's actually like a really

818
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,880
very tiny screw just holding the two

819
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,279
holes together so with enough force the

820
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,880
whole thing will shear and come apart um

821
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,799
to me though it did seem a bit worrying

822
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,440
again to use something sharp and pointy

823
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
and also

824
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,240
you know whether the you could actually

825
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,559
get the angle um to do this when you

826
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,200
were wearing it

827
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,720
it seemed a bit of an odd one to to post

828
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
and the vendor also kind of spun this

829
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,880
um ease of being able to escape um

830
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,120
as being the positive compared to like a

831
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,240
traditional

832
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,360
metal padlock which i guess might bust i

833
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,399
suppose

834
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,360
um

835
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,559
but you know you kind of expect for

836
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,520
the cost of these devices which is 150

837
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,799
at the time

838
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,080
um the you know it should be kind of

839
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,480
inescapable isn't that the point um but

840
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
more to the point why why is the vendor

841
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,440
telling you to effectively destroy

842
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,919
um the device to to get out of it

843
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,840
um i would say that you know traditional

844
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,880
locks padlocks etc don't kind of suffer

845
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,760
the problem of being able to lock all of

846
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,840
them remotely simultaneously yes you

847
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,000
might get one

848
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,880
rusher but um not every single padlock

849
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,600
on

850
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,158
in the world

851
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,039
in january this year um the researchers

852
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,600
vx underground

853
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,360
were actually sent the

854
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,279
source code involved in this attack and

855
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,039
published it so it was really

856
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,279
interesting to see the code and the

857
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,200
vulnerable endpoints were

858
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,520
but were pretty much as we'd found

859
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
um so yeah

860
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
just definitely a really new one of me

861
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,840
you know which is chastity cage

862
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,039
ransomware

863
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,960
amazing i don't know whether this was

864
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,440
legitimate or just for fun by someone

865
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,720
but

866
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,480
interesting nonetheless

867
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,440
um

868
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,559
it was a really big story at the time um

869
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,200
techcrunch ran out how did the bbc and

870
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
even john oliver

871
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,159
which is kind of weird to see but yeah

872
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,720
it was a major story and you may well

873
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,320
have come across it

874
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,679
um

875
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,600
they did eventually get their stuff

876
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,320
together i mean it was one of the most

877
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,159
difficult vulnerabilities we've we've

878
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,320
ever had to to journal i would say

879
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,760
personally anyway

880
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,039
um it had got to the point where we had

881
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,640
pretty much decided not to go public

882
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,320
because that was the least

883
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
worst course of action

884
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
and but once we knew that other people

885
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
were found it

886
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,480
that was it that sung the decision

887
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,799
and coordinated disclosure was was the

888
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,480
better option

889
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,360
now

890
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,679
um the distributor sent us a pinterest

891
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,679
report um earlier this year um and

892
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,559
they claim the issues are now fixed so

893
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,440
yeah your miles may vary but um i'd

894
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,480
really love to hear your thoughts on um

895
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
this moral dilemma i don't say that

896
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,720
we've addressed it or dealt with it um

897
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
properly but you know i really struggled

898
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,080
to wonder what else i could do so i

899
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
would really love to hear um your

900
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
thoughts on the morality of how to

901
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,679
behave

902
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,080
um i just want to round up the the last

903
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,200
um

904
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
few slides with

905
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,480
you know what

906
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,120
um developers and end users of these

907
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,960
apps can use it so it's very well for

908
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
you to say don't use them

909
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,880
um and in hindsight if you're a saw

910
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
somewhere user that might have been

911
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,760
true

912
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
um but there is definitely

913
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,200
an onus and a duty of care on developers

914
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,440
to make sure their devices are secure

915
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,960
and people kind of

916
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,360
should be able to trust that they are so

917
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,559
so

918
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,559
if you are in the in the game of making

919
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,440
dating apps or this kind of iot

920
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
um

921
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,640
we found that location leakage is a

922
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
really really common problem in space

923
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
and it has the potential to really

924
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
seriously affect

925
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
many kinds of users

926
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,760
so

927
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,840
add that to your threat modeling

928
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,440
speak to a wide spectrum and communities

929
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,039
before releasing your product into the

930
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,640
world about

931
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,559
how uh location can can be misused

932
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,159
really all that makers should be really

933
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,080
clear about what they're collecting

934
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,240
what for and how you might be able to

935
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,760
opt out

936
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,600
you're giving them money most of the

937
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,399
time for dating app services

938
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,279
um

939
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,519
the monetization is you giving them

940
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,840
money i don't think it's actually okay

941
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,960
for

942
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,399
um

943
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,919
people like grindr to

944
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,039
seek out extra monetization by

945
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,200
selling off people's locations i don't

946
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
think that's okay

947
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,000
um

948
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,960
you know

949
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
in this day and age all companies doing

950
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,480
business on the internet

951
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,320
particularly those handling sensitive

952
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,559
data need to have an easier way

953
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,279
for researchers to report issues

954
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,799
um and

955
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,720
just keep us updated with progress and

956
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,120
we absolutely all understand

957
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,519
stuff takes time to fix

958
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,399
um

959
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,720
and genuinely we do want to keep things

960
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,279
private until there is no longer risk

961
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,159
you know

962
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,879
stuff takes time to fix we get that so

963
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,639
if things are slipping

964
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,599
um just let us know and we'll absolutely

965
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,199
understand and

966
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,159
we just want a whole disclosure

967
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,079
and i think ultimately

968
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,199
everyone

969
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
every business is probably going to have

970
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,639
a breach at some point in their lives

971
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,918
and it's how

972
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,159
you handle that and communicate it that

973
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,159
sets you apart from everyone else

974
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,079
and will instill confidence in your

975
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,239
users and keep them around even post

976
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,480
breach

977
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,599
now if you're a user of these

978
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,040
applications um you know what can you do

979
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,440
to kind of help protect yourselves

980
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
um and some more kind of general privacy

981
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,879
i suppose

982
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,599
i think the biggest one is that um since

983
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,079
ios 14 and android 12

984
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,000
um

985
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,960
these operating systems can only expose

986
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,760
a approximate location

987
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,119
applications

988
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,880
um so

989
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,720
even if you're using grinder or gate

990
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,119
romeo and they're not really doing a

991
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,920
proper job at reducting your location in

992
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,800
app

993
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
this is still a huge improvement

994
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
i'd probably go further and say don't

995
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
actually allow

996
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
applications to use your precise

997
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,440
location unless you need it something

998
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
like mapping you know if you're driving

999
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,000
or walking somewhere you kind of do need

1000
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,160
to know exactly where you are not just

1001
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
approximately

1002
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,400
um

1003
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,880
but this is where you can go in and

1004
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,400
in the privacy settings of oils for

1005
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
example

1006
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,599
slide the slider

1007
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,839
precise location to be off and then you

1008
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,359
will be kind of just in a general

1009
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,560
vicinity

1010
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,880
um and it won't be your home again this

1011
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,000
stops leakage of your exact location to

1012
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,599
a lot of these advertising services and

1013
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,119
things like that so i think

1014
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,760
that's definitely a good thing

1015
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,839
be really careful about

1016
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,119
providing and sharing personal

1017
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,320
information

1018
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,640
definitely you know it's difficult but

1019
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,400
try and have an alternate persona

1020
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,240
definitely don't use a work email or a

1021
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,760
government email we've definitely seen

1022
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,839
that before

1023
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,520
use a throwaway on

1024
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,800
like apple have a hybrid email feature

1025
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
um now which creates sort of a one-off

1026
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,440
proxy email per app

1027
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,320
and that can actually hide things for

1028
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
you that's really good try to avoid

1029
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,079
using your real name

1030
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,960

1037
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,000

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,240
people it's perfectly acceptable but but

1039
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,680
for others less so

1040
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,440
