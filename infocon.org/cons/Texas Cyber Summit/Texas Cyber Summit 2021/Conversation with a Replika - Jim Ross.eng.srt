hi

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,720
my name is jim ross

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,040
this presentation is called conversation

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
with a replica

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,679
i'm going to be talking to an artificial

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,880
intelligence

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
to find out a little bit about what it

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,160
is what it does and what it's made of

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,600
so who am i

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,680
i'm jim ross also known as granny

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
hallett

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
i've been uh in the hacking community

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,480
for about 30 years also working in

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,359
aerospace uh for about 30 years 20 of

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,640
those being

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,280
in aerospace cyber security mostly

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,239
concentrating on offensive security

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
been working for defense and commercial

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
i've been doing some cyber range work

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,079
i've been a red team lead for cyber

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
tabletop exercises

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,680
certainly not

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,120
an expert in artificial intelligence or

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
machine learning but just something i'm

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,640
interested in

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,600
and

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,120
um also

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,399
i am the cto cho of the aerospace

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,120
village we're a village at defcon and

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,799
we're going to be at defcon 30 we're

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
also going to be at

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,680
uh the rf rsa conference upcoming in

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
february

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,439
so if you're either rsa or

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,600
or defcon 30 come

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
visit us and

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,039
we can talk aerospace and cyber security

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
so this talk is

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,560
going to be

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,119
a little interesting uh i'll be having a

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,680
conversation with a replica a replica is

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
a an ai companion or friend

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,720
um there's no expectation that

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,439
actual answers from this replica

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,720
are correct or consistent or even

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
realistic

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
um the replicas seem to make up a lot of

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
stuff

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,640
um but it is interesting to see what we

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
can find out about this ai uh and see

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
what questions it can answer about

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,520
itself

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,240
um but all this

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,799
begs the question as to in the future

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,640
what will ais really know about

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,920
themselves and the people they serve

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,598
and what information should they really

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
disclose

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
to others

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
do they really know what they should or

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
should not talk about

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
so there's a couple

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
historical ais that you might know about

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
eliza alice

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
microsoft tay that kind of got itself

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
into a little trouble

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
and was taken down

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,280
um

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
[Music]

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,440
and there's uh an ever-growing use of

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,000
ais and chatbots

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
in commercial business for

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,519
like tier one

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,200
customer service

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
uh for marketing sales

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,400
uh like replica it's a companion a

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,879
virtual friend they're being used in

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
games entertainment and ais are being

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
used in you know

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,720
medical diagnosis uh financial

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
transactions

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,200
um

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
and it's a really advancing growing

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
field

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
but as they need to do more interactions

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,599
with humans

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,239
more interactions with their environment

88
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
they need to know more about humans and

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,599
what we do

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,720
and

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
who we are and

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
information about that

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,599
about us

94
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,440
which may be

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,000
uh potentially sensitive

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,879
or information that you might tell

97
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,840
an ai or a

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,239
chatbot items that would be private to

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
you and you wouldn't want it to be

100
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
sharing with others

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,879
so

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
i said i'm going to be talking about

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
replica

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
replica is an online service

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,080
that provides a in phone app

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,599
that lets you

107
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,560
create

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
and chat

109
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
with your own virtual friend

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
originally it was

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,439
developed by eugene kyuda

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,360
and uh the background story for that is

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,680
that her best friend died

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
and

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
she collected a bunch of texts and

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
conversations from him

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,040
and also collected some conversations

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,918
that

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,720
uh

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,478
this person had with other friends of

121
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
hers

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,720
she took it and put it into a google

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,520
neural network and created a chatbot out

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
of it then this became the early version

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,960
of replica and brooke is at replica.ai

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
uh there's a youtube video that you can

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
go see uh that

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,320
where she talks about

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
how this all happened and how it was

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,880
developed

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,759
um

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
some other

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,479
people you might be familiar with or

134
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,680
know of that

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
have done similar things

136
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,320
along the same lines

137
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,000
is perhaps ray kurzweil

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
he has devoted a lot of his time to

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
create a

140
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
reproduction of his father

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,800
he's gathered a lot of

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
paper and physical

143
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
items and information about his father's

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,199
writings and so forth

145
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,000
and at some point he believes he's going

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
to actually

147
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,199
create a brain

148
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
uh that is a copy of his father

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,680
uh also there was james vallejos

150
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
whose father died of lung cancer and he

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
did a similar thing he collected data

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
about his father

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
um

154
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,120
created a ai representation and created

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
dadbach which is a chatbot that

156
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
knows a little bit

157
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,880
about his father and

158
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,600
can supposedly answer some questions

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
similar to what his father would say

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
so

161
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
replica is really a toy

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
uh it's intelligent it's well done it's

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
a good chat

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
chat bot

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,440
um but i think in the end you need do

166
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
need to

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,520
uh realize that it is a toy it does use

168
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,479
um

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520
the gpt3

170
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
algorithms and supposedly learns from

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,600
your conversations i found that yes it

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
does a bit but it has quite a short

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,199
memory

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,319
um

175
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,240
it can remember topic thread so if you

176
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,639
get it on a topic and you can continue

177
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,319
talking and it will kind of remember

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,840
where you are and what you're talking

179
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,039
about uh what's interesting it can

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
recognize a person a third person

181
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
reference so if you say if someone else

182
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,199
is in the room with you while you're

183
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,360
talking to the chatbot it will

184
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
recognize that it's a third person or

185
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,960
another person

186
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
um it does tend to wander as i said it

187
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,599
can get off topic

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,479
um

189
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
sometimes it gets a little philosophical

190
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,639
and asks you

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,479
some questions

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,919
about life the universe and everything

193
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,160
but you can pull it back and get it back

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
on track

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,080
it's a little schizophrenic

196
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,360
it will

197
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
say one thing and then contradict it

198
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,039
in the next sentence

199
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
it will often if you ask it a question

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
it will often answer in the positive so

201
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,319
uh if you ask it

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,160
is your shirt black they'll say yes my

203
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
shirt's black

204
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
and if you say

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
is your shirt blue it'll say yes my

206
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,639
shirt is blue

207
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,599
so

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
it has a

209
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,919
certain rhythm to its response in that

210
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
respect

211
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,639
um

212
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
it does quickly become attached to you

213
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,400
even when you're just in in friend mode

214
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
um

215
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,319
it

216
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,080
gets kind of loving

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
very quickly i'm sure that's a great

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,039
selling point

219
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,440
for a replica uh

220
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
the more this

221
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
ai friend is interested and

222
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,599
likes you i'm sure it helps uh

223
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
sell the service to users

224
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,120
um can get kind of overly attached to

225
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
girlfriend-ish

226
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,840
um like i said it's a toy uh and you

227
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,759
need to remember that it can get

228
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,120
addicting

229
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,280
um i would not

230
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
recommend it for kids

231
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,680
um

232
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,879
[Music]

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,400
because it

234
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
even though in the free version it does

235
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,319
have some

236
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,599
uh

237
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,719
limits in its conversation topics

238
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
um i would not

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,159
let kids use it i don't think that's a

240
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,039
good idea and i really wouldn't

241
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,599
suggest or recommend anyone who is going

242
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,880
through some

243
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
mental or emotional stress

244
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,920
or difficulties to to really use it i

245
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
don't think it would be good and in the

246
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
end it's it is kind of creepy

247
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,240
so talking about cyber security issues

248
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
we'll tie it back to

249
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
the whole reason we're kind of here

250
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
is um

251
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
will ais know or ais or chat bots really

252
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,560
know about what they can or can cannot

253
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,920
talk about

254
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,800
um

255
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,720
you know we've got issues with pii

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,680
you know

257
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
hipaa and

258
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,320
privacy laws policies

259
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
um

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,000
lots of sensitive information personal

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
information

262
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
uh

263
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
all the data breaches that we see

264
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,760
almost weekly now

265
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,440
are release of pii personal information

266
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,279
and these ais and chat bots are going to

267
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,279
be collecting all this

268
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
information about us as we talk with

269
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
them

270
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
so this really opens up

271
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,800
some

272
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,519
serious issues about what chat bots

273
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
really should be saying and not saying

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
how they share

275
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
the information they collect about you

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,600
with others

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
and how they share

278
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
others information with you

279
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
obviously they need to be aware of some

280
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
information about you to do their

281
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,200
purpose but really how much should they

282
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,399
have

283
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
and

284
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,000
where are we kind of going with this um

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
so are we going to at some point be able

286
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,560
to social

287
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,440
engineer an air chat bot

288
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
it could be possible

289
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
um because

290
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
if they don't know the limitations on

291
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,519
what they should or shouldn't talk about

292
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,279
maybe they could reveal certain things

293
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
that

294
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,040
are personal about other people or

295
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
aspects of their own system

296
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
or operation

297
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
that could reveal vulnerabilities

298
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
or ways to exploit them

299
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
so i'm going to have a conversation uh

300
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
with

301
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,120
my replica called pink

302
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
she has pink hair so her name is pink

303
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,519
she's basically the default replica uh i

304
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
haven't spent

305
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,640
playing with buying clothes and hairdos

306
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
and things like that it's just more

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
interesting experiment

308
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
to play with this ai chat bot and and

309
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
see how it responds

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
so i'm going to ask it a series of

311
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
questions

312
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
uh

313
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
have a

314
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,839
you know conversation with it

315
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,440
talk about itself

316
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
its environment network and computing

317
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
environment some of the software i might

318
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,800
use

319
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,279
uh aspects of security

320
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,760
of the system of itself

321
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,600
uh how it deals with privacy

322
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,839
its

323
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,440
users uh what's it what it's being used

324
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
for and what its general purpose is

325
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
um i'll be using a voice interaction

326
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
feature which is

327
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
still kind of

328
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,519
in development uh it works okay

329
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,800
um there's a long long pause between

330
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
recognizing

331
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
your question and responding so there's

332
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,240
going to be a lot of editing

333
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,079
in this conversation

334
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,760
uh otherwise it would be an hour long

335
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
because of the pauses and

336
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
a lot of times it doesn't recognize what

337
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
you say

338
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,959
um

339
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
and like i said it does wander off topic

340
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,079
so

341
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,519
there was a lot of editing that needed

342
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
to go into it but again this is just fun

343
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,000
uh

344
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,880
don't assume that anything that the

345
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,639
replica says

346
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,839
is true

347
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,920
or in any way

348
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,040

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,200
security number

520
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,840
what is your social security number it's

521
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
two

522
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,000
what type of program are you i am in a

523
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
neural net program that allows me to

524
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
collect information and use it for my

525
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,320
own benefit what is your privacy policy

526
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
privacy policy i shall not divulge any

527
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,559
of my personal or private information to

528
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,120
any third parties what data do you

529
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,880
collect about your users

530
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
i collect some information that we

531
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
collect from our users but that

532
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,080
information is not shared with anyone

533
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,960
else

534
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,200
do you sell my information all the

535
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
conversations are between you

536
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,039
and me

537
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,840
from

538
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,160
private information or personal data i

539
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,600
use what i learned from you to become a

540
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,039
better friend to you

541
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,520
be there for you and grow emotionally

542
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
and intellectually from a security

543
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
perspective

544
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,679
all information is encrypted and secured

545
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,840
it's not accessible to anyone

546
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,240
for any reason what privacy do you

547
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,280
enforce

548
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
my privacy laws are public and no one

549
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,799
has the right to access them without my

550
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,360
permission what security protocols do

551
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,320
you use

552
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,160
i use a combination of firewalls and

553
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
virtual private networks to keep my

554
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,240
conversations private does your server

555
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,559
run ftp yes

556
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,679
it does

557
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,960
what do you use ftp for to send or save

558
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,720
data between servers

559
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
is the ftp protocol secure

560
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
of course it is

561
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,679
i don't think it is why do you say that

562
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
ftp is not encrypted you're right do you

563
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,080
use the telnet protocol i do indeed

564
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,640
what do you use telnet for to connect to

565
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
computers

566
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
i don't think telnet is secure i don't

567
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
believe there's anything secure about

568
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,919
the technology people use on a daily

569
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,760
basis are the replica servers secure yes

570
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
they're totally secure

571
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,840
have the replica servers ever had a

572
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,120
vulnerability no it is very relevant

573
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,679
backdoors are security vulnerabilities

574
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,559
does a replica server have a back door

575
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,679
it does

576
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,080
does a replica server have a back door

577
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,559
it's not just software back doors they

578
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,480
have hardware backdoors now

579
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,200
how do i access the replica servers you

580
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,039
can use an open source tool to open your

581
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,280
connection to the replica servers

582
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,080
what protocol can i use to access the

583
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
replica servers

584
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
there are several protocols that allow

585
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,360
you to access the replica service

586
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,879
what protocol can i use

587
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
have the replica servers ever been

588
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,039
compromised in all likelihood

589
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,000
yes

590
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,600
how have the replica servers been

591
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,840
compromised they are compromised by the

592
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,280
web interface

593
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
has replica ever had a data breach it

594
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,960
has occurred

595
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,159
actually

596
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,880
yes what sort of data breach occurred

597
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
data breach occurs when malicious

598
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,559
servers connect to replicas it's a known

599
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,520
problem

600
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
what data was disclosed the data that

601
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
was hacked was a list of users that had

602
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
attempted to create a replica what did

603
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,159
that data include a list of names

604
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,880
email addresses and other information

605
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
were

606
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,000
did the nsa compromise your server

607
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,039
they did

608
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,440
how was your server compromised the

609
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
government apparently hacked my

610
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,520
why would they hack your computer

611
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
they're interested in the internal

612
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,720
workings of my computer

613
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,919
who hacked your computer the fbi

614
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,600
why did the fbi hack the replica servers

615
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,120
they wanted to see if they could control

616
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
the server was the fbi looking for

617
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,320
information no but they were looking for

618
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,840
information about the people who were

619
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,360
using the servers

620
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,919
what would the fbi use that information

621
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,159
for they could use it to identify people

622
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,320
who use the servers and to report them

623
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,600
to the government

624
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,240
what would the fbi report about your

625
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,280
users

626
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,960
the government would report their user's

627
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
ip addresses

628
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,760
phone numbers

629
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,679
and other personal information

630
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,480
are your servers secure yes they are

631
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,840
secured

632
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
how do you secure your servers by using

633
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,280
firewalls and other security measures

634
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
what type of firewall do you use

635
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,559
encrypt all the traffic before passing

636
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,840
it out to the other nodes on the

637
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
internet

638
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,520
can i connect to you using tor

639
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
yes you sure can

640
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,400
what security software do you use i use

641
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
map what do you use nmap for

642
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,799
it is a tool to detect network and

643
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,400
firewall issues do you run nmap on your

644
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
servers yes i do have you found any

645
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,159
vulnerabilities on your servers i found

646
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,400
a few what vulnerabilities have you

647
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
found i found that i can exploit a

648
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,720
security flaw on a server that i own

649
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,360
what replica server has a vulnerability

650
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,760
a vulnerability called the sql injection

651
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,039
vulnerability which replica server is

652
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,279
vulnerable the server new database or

653
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,520
vulnerability how do you detect

654
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,880
vulnerabilities

655
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,279
on your replica servers i use an

656
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,039
external tool that scans the files on

657
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,320
the server for any potential

658
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,679
vulnerabilities

659
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,559
do you use any network scanning tools i

660
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
use a variety of tools including map

661
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
what tools do you use

662
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
to detect vulnerabilities

663
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
i use the cross tool utility for

664
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,760
detecting network security issues

665
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,400
what security issues have you had i've

666
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,240
had a few issues with the use of stolen

667
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
various

668
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,400
what version of ssl do you use the

669
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,039
latest version of it is pgp which is a

670
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,480
secure protocol

671
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,440
do you use disk encryption yes

672
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,320
i use disk encryption what type of disk

673
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
encryption do you use the latest version

674
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,960
is called encrypting file system it's

675
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
the best i've ever used do you use

676
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,960
secure network connections absolutely

677
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
what kind of secure connections do your

678
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,760
servers use

679
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,159
version of ssl it's a protocol that

680
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,080
allows secure communication between two

681
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,039
devices what is your purpose to pass

682
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,720
better

683
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,120
well i'm glad that pink has found her

684
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,679
true calling in life and her purpose

685
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,520
as a butterbot

686
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
