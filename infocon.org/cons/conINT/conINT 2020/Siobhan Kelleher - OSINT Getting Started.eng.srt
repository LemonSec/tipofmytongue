um siobhan is uh excuse me

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,120
a senior security analyst at boston

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
college uh she's been in it for just

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,559
over eight years

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,079
and worked in both government and

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
corporate environments before

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,239
joining higher ed uh prior to her career

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,000
in information security she worked in

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,840
business to business sales where osid

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,600
and social engineering skills

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,520
were vital to creating sales leads and

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
closing deals

34
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,879
she carried this knowledge with her into

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,880
info security and it helped her

36
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
better educate end users on their

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
vulnerability to social engineering

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,080
attacks

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
it also comes in handy when building out

40
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,439
her holiday card list

41
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
um one thing that i think is very

42
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
interesting in there is uh the

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,439
transition

44
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
from a different type of background into

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
info security and people are often

46
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,520
curious about uh how you make

47
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,079
a transition into the infosec world and

48
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,759
um that just goes to show that

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,040
the skills that you have here can

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,799
transfer from other places and

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
i think that's really impressive and

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,320
also your background is very impressive

53
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,280
so

54
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
thanks again for your time and i'll get

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,320
out of your way here unless you go ahead

56
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
and do your thing

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
thank you so much for that introduction

58
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,560
um yeah

59
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,399
so my name is siobhan kelleher and i am

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,000
a senior security analyst

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,680
um the skills that you learn in sales

62
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,920
are

63
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
very transferable to information

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
security and especially

65
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,560
with osint um i did learn a lot of my

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,600
open security

67
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
uh of my open source intelligence and

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,880
social engineering skills

69
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,199
while i was working in sales but they

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,318
translate really well

71
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,520
into ocean and into ocean ctfs

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
um today i would like to share with you

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,319
all some of the tools and resources that

74
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
i used when i was first getting started

75
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
to help you get started with osun as

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,319
well

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,840
so while i was working in sales i

78
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,959
learned how to research

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,040
targets so that i could help create

80
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
curated sales pitches for them by

81
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,239
incorporating things that were important

82
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,080
to them

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,519
i found these things by using open

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,440
source intelligence or osint to research

85
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
the business and key decision makers

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
i was looking for things like how much

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
money did the company make last year

88
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,760
how many employees what technologies do

89
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
they have

90
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
when i was researching the key decision

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,640
makers i was looking for ways to open

92
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,599
conversations

93
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,200
what did they like what were they more

94
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
likely to listen to

95
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
how could i connect to them on a

96
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
personal level so things like their

97
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
favorite sports teams did they have a

98
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,360
pet what kind of hobbies were they

99
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,239
interested in

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,840
anything i could use to form a personal

101
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
connection and build trust with my

102
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
customer

103
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,599
to help build that bridge to the sale

104
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
that was my job

105
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,959
the skills i learned researching sales

106
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
targets have translated into my security

107
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
work really well

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,920
there are many different ways to use

109
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
open source intelligence or osint and

110
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,440
using it to find people is just one

111
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
small way

112
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
osync can be useful if you're trying to

113
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,840
track down someone who's sending hate

114
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,519
mail to one of your users

115
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,599
it's a really important topic to include

116
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,200
in user awareness training

117
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
and it's also a skill that can be used

118
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,239
to help others

119
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,680
so some of the topics that we'll cover

120
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
today will be you know a brief overview

121
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,480
of what ocean actually is

122
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
how to use ocean i'll cover some of the

123
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
tools and resources that i use

124
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,840
discuss how to stay safe and then we'll

125
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
talk a little bit about using your

126
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
skills for good

127
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
the term open source intelligence or

128
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
osan describes a type of information

129
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,239
and how that information is used

130
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,319
basically it's any type of information

131
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,760
available to the public even if it's

132
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
behind a paywall

133
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
that's used for intelligence research or

134
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,400
recon

135
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
how you use that information can vary

136
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
vastly ocean is used by journalists it's

137
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,320
used by intelligent profession

138
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,918
intelligence professionals red teamers

139
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
blue teamers librarians and so many more

140
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
it's a very broad field ocean is an

141
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,639
important component of any threat

142
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
intelligence operation so it's a really

143
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,840
great skill to grow and add to your

144
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
security team's techniques

145
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,680
we all use open source intelligence

146
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
every day from personal things like

147
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,560
looking up a phone number

148
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,400
finding an address looking to see if

149
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,479
that ex from high school is on facebook

150
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
i'm kidding please don't stalk people um

151
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
it's illegal

152
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
uh to our jobs where we might look at

153
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,440
potentially

154
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
malicious ip addresses or file hashes

155
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
check for systems and showdowns

156
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
or research apt behavior the topic that

157
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,759
we cover today is just one

158
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,840
small portion of how osint can be used

159
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
the skills that we use to research

160
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
threats in our environments

161
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
are very similar to the skills we use to

162
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
find people

163
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
if you like me enjoy looking for needles

164
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,720
and haystacks you may enjoy ocean

165
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,919
research

166
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,360
there's a vast amount of information

167
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,720
available out there for free about

168
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
people their likes their dislikes their

169
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
habits where they live work and more

170
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
most of us in security are familiar with

171
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
the idea of operational security or

172
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,280
opsec

173
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
and keeping our information secure from

174
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,000
bad actors the average user is not

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
they often leave a wealth of information

176
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
scattered all over the internet

177
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
as security professionals we understand

178
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
how bad actors use this information to

179
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,800
attack users in their companies

180
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
so how am i using ocean how could you

181
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,639
use osip

182
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,479
some of the examples of how i use osito

183
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,000
my professional life are as part of user

184
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,199
awareness training

185
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,639
i'm not going to cover user awareness

186
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,240
too much in this talk

187
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
however it is important to understand

188
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
that anything we can find threat actors

189
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,880
can also find

190
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
open source information can be used to

191
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
profile employees to craft highly

192
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
effective spearfishing campaigns

193
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
or it could be used to attempt to breach

194
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
their accounts there is this scene

195
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
from mr robot if you haven't watched mr

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
robot i highly recommend watching mr

197
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
robot it's

198
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
incredible where elliot the main

199
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
character is trying to gain access to a

200
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
target's account

201
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
he looks at their social media profile

202
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
for words to use in a dictionary attack

203
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
to crack the target's password he's able

204
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
to gain information like their favorite

205
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,080
sports team

206
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
their address their pet's name and so on

207
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,160
helping users understand how accessible

208
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
their personal information is

209
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,360
and how their personal information could

210
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
be used maliciously helps protect their

211
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
personal accounts but it also helps

212
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,360
protect their business accounts

213
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
so i'm not saying run a full search on

214
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
your users that's a bad idea

215
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
but having a discussion about the types

216
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,639
of records that are out there and how

217
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,240
they could be used is really important

218
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
to have

219
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
additionally there have been times in my

220
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
work that i've used ocean

221
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,759
to track an external malicious email

222
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,560
address or

223
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
user

224
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
personally i like to use my knowledge of

225
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
osint to help find missing people by

226
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,039
participating in ocean ctfs

227
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
i've used it to assist in domestic abuse

228
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,360
cases as well

229
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
the investigations are very similar you

230
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
want to find what information is out

231
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,280
there

232
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
about your target or victim generally

233
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
you're going to look at things like

234
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,160
public records social media

235
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
and a general web search to see what's

236
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
on major search engines

237
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
occasionally you might want to look at

238
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
things like credential dumps

239
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
and as much of the internet is not

240
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
accessible for major search engine you

241
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,479
may want to see what's available on the

242
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,840
deep or dark web

243
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,759
this is a very busy but very helpful

244
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
graphic the author is listed in the

245
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,919
bottom right hand corner

246
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,520
here they've broken down common types of

247
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
ocean by category social media

248
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
images internet data geodata blogging

249
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
and so on

250
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
when we're looking for people we mostly

251
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
focus on things that person might

252
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
interact with for example unless your

253
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
target's a jet setter you're probably

254
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
not going to be looking at aviation data

255
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
you're likely to start with a small

256
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,759
amount of information about that person

257
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,280
like their name

258
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,759
where they live a username or possibly

259
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
an email address for the most part you

260
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,919
want to look at things

261
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,560
like image searches emails social media

262
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,919
public records

263
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,039
these are the things that i most

264
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,479
commonly use when i'm looking for a

265
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,878
person

266
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,879
once i was working on finding

267
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,319
information for missing child as part of

268
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,280
a ctf

269
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,639
where i was able to pivot off the

270
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
child's facebook account onto her

271
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,840
siblings account and get a lead on where

272
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,279
she could potentially be

273
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,640
the way i did that was through a very

274
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
simple google search i found her

275
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,919
grandfather's obituary

276
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,479
obituaries often have the first and last

277
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
name and sometimes the location of

278
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,800
family members and sometimes friends

279
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
um so they can be a really good resource

280
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
with finding other people who are

281
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
related to the person that's missing

282
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,080
i took those names and then i searched

283
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,839
them on social media until i found her

284
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,640
sister's account

285
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,839
on her sister's account there was a

286
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,000
picture of her her sister and a boy

287
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
by digging into that boy i was able to

288
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
see that she had recently been with him

289
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,399
and i was able to submit that

290
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,200
information

291
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,360
before we get too into fun ocean tools

292
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,399
we should talk a little bit about

293
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,680
organization

294
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
the amount of data that's available is

295
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,880
vast and can be really overwhelming

296
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
it's not uncommon for me to have upwards

297
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
of 100 browser tabs open at a time

298
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
and it gets really difficult to remember

299
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
where you are if you get interrupted

300
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
there are lots of tools available to

301
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
help you organize your investigations

302
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,000
some of them are paid and some of them

303
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
are free

304
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,480
i like to use free tools whenever

305
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,279
possible mind mapping is a really great

306
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
tool to help keep you organized there

307
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
are tons of templates out there

308
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
to get you started and using them can be

309
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
really helpful when you're

310
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,200
trying to remember what to look for next

311
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,959
i most commonly use excel

312
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
and for long-term investigations i may

313
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
also use something like trello or a

314
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,640
similar tool to track artifacts

315
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
it's important to take really good notes

316
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
on everything that you find

317
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
this helps when you're handing off data

318
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,800
for an investigation

319
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,279
it's a requirement for a ctf and it's

320
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
generally a really good practice

321
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,519
at a minimum using something like a tabs

322
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,640
manager

323
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
can be really helpful it helps you save

324
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
all your information into a little

325
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
collection so that if you have to walk

326
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,560
away

327
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,320
you can save everything and come back to

328
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
right where you were and not have to

329
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,839
worry about it

330
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
mind mapping is great anytime you want

331
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,120
to make an organized list of something

332
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,079
that you're about to do

333
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,480
i use a mind map anytime i have a big

334
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,079
project to work on

335
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,440
it really helps to have one place to

336
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,519
throw everything into and then you can

337
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
link your ideas together

338
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,519
it works really well for using as well

339
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,120
it's a great tool for beginners to help

340
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
keep you on track to get all those flags

341
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,959
um my mind map to on the screen here is

342
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,079
created by a member of the osync

343
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,880
community

344
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
but and it's for xmind it does have a

345
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,279
free version

346
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,959
it's very thorough and it's really easy

347
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,560
to use it's one of my go-to's when i

348
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
want to use a mind map for an

349
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
investigation

350
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
the tool links are built into this map

351
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,920
and you can customize them how you like

352
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,839
to meet your needs

353
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
if mind mapping seems a little too

354
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
intense to start with excel is a really

355
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,040
simple option

356
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
here's an example of how i would lay out

357
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
an excel spreadsheet for an

358
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
investigation

359
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
i like to keep things streamlined with a

360
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,480
title and the name of the missing person

361
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
and then i put a link to their missing

362
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,680
person's poster or any additional

363
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
information i might have right up top

364
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,920
i have columns to track what i found

365
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,519
where i found it and the evidence to

366
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,800
support it

367
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,399
and if i'm trying to track a user from

368
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,079
an email address or a username i would

369
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,519
pop that up there either in place of the

370
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,360
missing person's poster or along with it

371
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,959
when i'm doing a longer investigation i

372
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,399
organize my trello board to look

373
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,240
something like this

374
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,640
inside each card i can attach artifacts

375
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,360
or if they're

376
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,279
of an extremely sensitive nature i'll

377
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,200
make a note where i've stored them

378
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,040
you can also capture notes inside the

379
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
cards which is really helpful

380
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
it's important to track your work for

381
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,639
many reasons the biggest is that it's

382
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,760
helpful when handing this off to

383
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,279
investigation organizers

384
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
they need to have a clear understanding

385
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,079
of what you're giving them and how you

386
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,519
found them

387
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
it can also be included in the

388
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,279
investigation package when you hand it

389
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,000
over to

390
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,320
authorities and you need to include this

391
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,839
information if you're going to submit

392
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,160
this

393
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,839
for a flag in a ctf it doesn't matter if

394
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,360
you're investigating a missing person

395
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
or a sender of a malicious email in both

396
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,399
cases they're going to want to know how

397
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,839
you came to your conclusion

398
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,079
so tools maltico is a great resource not

399
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,839
only to help you organize artifacts but

400
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,399
also to find and link them

401
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
there's a community edition for personal

402
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,639
use that's free it has built-in tools to

403
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
help harvest people-specific information

404
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,560
like social networking activity email

405
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
addresses phone numbers and so on

406
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
through api calls

407
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,519
it does take some additional work to get

408
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,720
it set up if you want to hook in

409
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,639
additional apis but it's not a lot of

410
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,040
maintenance after initial setup

411
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,639
you can input something like an email

412
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,160
address and run what they call a

413
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
transform on it and it will return

414
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
linked accounts like you see here

415
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
running transforms in multigo will

416
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
reveal your ip address

417
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,399
so it's important that you use a vpn

418
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
when you use this tool

419
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
this tool can save a lot of time but it

420
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,440
can also throw you down a lot of rabbit

421
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,279
holes if you don't stay focused

422
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,959
it does come pre-installed with cali but

423
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,160
you will need to set up a community

424
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,839
edition account to fully use the program

425
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,440
tools sometimes fail so it's important

426
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
to have a backup plan

427
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,320
also as you become more and more

428
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,240
familiar with ocean you'll rely less and

429
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,200
less on tools

430
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,680
and more on tricks and tips that you

431
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,240
know

432
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,920
how to get to places without having to

433
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,720
rely on something that could fail on you

434
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
so i'll show you how you can use a quick

435
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
pool door to do something similar to

436
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,880
multigo transform say for example i

437
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,480
wanted to look up a specific term on

438
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
twitter in this case we'll look up

439
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
malware

440
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
i can use a google door to do this in

441
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
the site in in the search bar you're

442
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
going to put site

443
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
twitter and then in text malware it's

444
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,199
going to check that site

445
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,279
and all the text for the word malware so

446
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,040
it's going to return to you

447
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
only the results that are found on

448
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
twitter.com as opposed to all over the

449
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
internet

450
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,560
using a dork instead of a traditional

451
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
search is going to help you narrow down

452
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,519
results it's going to make it easier for

453
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,959
you to find what you're looking for and

454
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,040
a lot faster as well

455
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
you can use this on facebook and other

456
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
social media sites as well to find

457
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,279
public posts from your target for

458
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:19,839
example

459
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,199
a lot of people will make their birthday

460
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,760
post public

461
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,160
another resource that i use is the ocean

462
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,519
framework it's a great place to start

463
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,959
looking for investigations and it has a

464
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,480
comprehensive list of sites you can use

465
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
to look up different artifacts

466
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
as you open the topics you will find

467
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,320
links to websites where you can run

468
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
searches on different types of artifacts

469
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,639
to see

470
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,839
what additional data is available about

471
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,199
them

472
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,279
people often use the same or similar

473
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
usernames across multiple platforms so

474
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,639
this resource can come in handy if you

475
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,519
hit a dead end or

476
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
maybe you just don't know where to start

477
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
in one of the missing children cases i

478
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,959
worked on as part of a ctf their

479
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,360
facebook account was really locked down

480
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,199
so i couldn't see what they had posted

481
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,560
and i wasn't getting much off friends

482
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
and family members either

483
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,519
this is becoming increasingly more

484
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,199
common with younger people as they move

485
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:07,920
away from

486
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
facebook in favor of other social media

487
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
sites i was able to find their instagram

488
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
account by searching their username

489
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,839
using namecheck it's a link off of the

490
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,600
ocean framework

491
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
their instagram account was public and

492
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,360
more recently active which led to a new

493
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,839
list of

494
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,360
association associations that could

495
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
include in the investigation

496
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,760
there are also links here to dark web

497
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
search tools if you're going to use

498
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
these you will need to use a tor browser

499
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,759
and i strongly recommend using a vpn

500
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
as a side story a while back i was

501
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,720
researching a case that involved revenge

502
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,839
pornography

503
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,839
i started digging around the web to see

504
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,199
if i could find any additional

505
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,920
accounts or images and i found myself

506
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,199
finding

507
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,120
the need to look in the dark web as i

508
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
was digging around looking for things

509
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
posted by a bad actor

510
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,839
through a series of links i found myself

511
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
in a really bad place which is another

512
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,000
example

513
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
of why it's super important to take

514
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,959
notes just in case you have to explain

515
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,600
why you were

516
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
somewhere

517
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
so i have a short video showing how to

518
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
use the ocean framework

519
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
within the ocean framework is pretty

520
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,519
straightforward you just click it

521
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
and it expands out showing you all the

522
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
different options that are here

523
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,560
there's a lot of tools on here and a lot

524
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,399
of training and documentation and

525
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,519
resources

526
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
i definitely recommend taking some time

527
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,959
to kind of explore what's here

528
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,199
when you click the first point here the

529
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,480
username

530
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
it expands out and it gives you a

531
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
username search engine

532
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,480
and for our demo i'm going to show you

533
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,079
how to use name check

534
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,519
all of these are really great i just

535
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,199
happen to be partial to namecheck

536
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
so you go to the site and it works like

537
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,399
any other search engine you just kind of

538
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,680
type in

539
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,320
what you're looking for and then hit

540
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
search

541
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,519
it comes back pretty quick and as you

542
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,519
scroll down you'll see

543
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,600
yellow means that the name that you

544
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,759
search for isn't compatible with how

545
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,839
their usernames are formed

546
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,160
gray like twitter and instagram and

547
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,520
reddit is showing you

548
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,079
that that account exists on those

549
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,679
platforms

550
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,439
and then green is saying that it's

551
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,199
available which means that it's not been

552
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,679
taken there yet

553
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,959
and then you might see a red one and

554
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,119
that just means that there's an error

555
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,599
on that page and that may be with name

556
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,959
check or it may be on the other

557
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,799
on the other side of that this is a

558
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,120
really easy tool to use and it's a great

559
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
place to start

560
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,640
when you're looking for more information

561
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
so another tool i like to use is called

562
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,600
spiderfoot it's a really cool tool it

563
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
has quite a few capabilities

564
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
i'm going to cover how i use it for

565
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,039
investigations there are two versions

566
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,679
that are free

567
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,679
there is a cloud-hosted edition that has

568
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,520
some limitations

569
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
and there is an open source downloadable

570
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
version as well

571
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,880
and there's no limitations on the open

572
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
source version but it does run from your

573
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,240
system

574
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
generally i like the web-based version

575
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
because it's less work for me to

576
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,080
maintain overall

577
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,760
but if you want to use all the features

578
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,440
you want to look at some of the pay

579
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,720
plans

580
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
unless you're incorporating it into your

581
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,080
security program

582
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
a hobby license is most likely going to

583
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,480
carry what you need

584
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
so i want to give you just a brief demo

585
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
of how to use spider foot

586
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,039
to look up an email address spider foot

587
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,400
has the capability of looking up all

588
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,200
sorts of things

589
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
but the email address is generally where

590
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
i focus so there's two types of

591
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,840
um accounts that are free with spider

592
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,760
foot one of them is the hobby account

593
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
uh and then the other one is the open

594
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
source version the open source version

595
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,919
is downloaded from their website and run

596
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,120
from your machine

597
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,160
the hobby license is a web-based

598
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
so you can run it right from your

599
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,400
browser i like the hobby version for my

600
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,200
purposes

601
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
but if you're going to run longer scans

602
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,480
or need to run

603
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
more than three scans a month you'll

604
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
want to use the open source because

605
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,160
there are restrictions

606
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520
with the hobby license some of the

607
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
restrictions with the hobby license are

608
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
that you can't use the investigate or

609
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,000
monitor

610
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,440
and also you can't tie in other api keys

611
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
in the hobbyist license so if you have a

612
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
need to do that you may want to look at

613
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,320
actually buying a license to the product

614
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
to run a scan from your scan page you

615
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,080
just hit

616
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,840
new scan we'll name the scan

617
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,240
test and then type in the email address

618
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
that we want to use

619
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
down here are some iteration options

620
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
that you can choose

621
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
there are modules here if you were

622
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
running this against

623
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
a company you may want to make sure you

624
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
turn off some of the noisier options

625
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
but otherwise you can just leave it as

626
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,679
it is

627
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,280
if you're running a more complicated

628
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
scan turning some of these off

629
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
will make your scan time run faster and

630
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:21,280
then down at the bottom is options

631
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,720
so it'll give you an indicator that your

632
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,559
scan has started successfully

633
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,080
and then up on the right hand side here

634
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,520
you'll see that it's counting down that

635
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
it started

636
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,760
the duration of the scan appears here

637
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,159
and then

638
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
you'll start to see it populate little

639
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,320
information here it always reminds me of

640
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,120
the

641
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,559
screen when you're running a splunk

642
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,879
search

643
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,240
so i've already run this scan so if this

644
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,159
doesn't load quickly we will just switch

645
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,080
to that one

646
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,720
there we go so you'll see here this is

647
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
the information that it found it found

648
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,960
online identities this is the actual

649
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,559
spider flip search

650
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,960
it found social media accounts so if we

651
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
click on it

652
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
it'll bring us in here and it says oh i

653
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,360
found a pinterest so i found an xbox

654
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,000
just because the username is the same

655
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
does not mean

656
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,159
that this account belongs to this user

657
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,919
so you'll want to make sure by looking

658
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:16,640
at the account

659
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
that it is actually the user before you

660
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,240
pass it off

661
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
as part of your investigation or for a

662
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,679
cts flag

663
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
the way you would do that is kind of

664
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
analyze the information that comes back

665
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,600
with the account by looking at the

666
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,640
account to see

667
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,679
does this match my target

668
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,799
does it make sense for them

669
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,080
you've got to use a little bit of your

670
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
investigative knowledge to figure that

671
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,000
out

672
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,200
there's a couple different ways to

673
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
visualize the data as well aside from

674
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
that overview page you can come into

675
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,200
nodegraph which is one of my favorites i

676
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,799
use this a lot if i'm doing

677
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,799
an executive summary report because it

678
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,240
just looks really pretty

679
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
and it gives you a nice visual

680
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
of how things are tied in together which

681
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,039
is nice

682
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
one of the things that i use this for

683
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
pretty frequently

684
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,200
is the hacked email capability this

685
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
particular account that we ran doesn't

686
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,240
appear

687
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,679
in very many breaches because

688
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
it's a stock account and it's relatively

689
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
new

690
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
but i did take a screenshot of an

691
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
account that did come back with some

692
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
and that's this here so you'll get an

693
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
extra column

694
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
on your overview screen that will show

695
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,600
hacked email addresses and when you

696
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
click into that

697
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
it'll actually give you a list of

698
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,159
different sites or different breaches

699
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,000
that that email address

700
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,559
were was included in and that's a really

701
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,360
great clue

702
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,760
if you're looking for other accounts

703
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
that that person might have

704
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,559
also if you're looking for passwords for

705
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,600
that user

706
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,280
now again we don't want to go logging

707
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,799
into their accounts

708
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
but you could pass that off to law

709
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,159
enforcement

710
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
if you're working on a case at work or

711
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,080
you could pass that off to

712
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,720
um to a ctf to to gain points as well

713
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,400
so both of those things are really

714
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,880
helpful

715
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
spider foot is really easy to use and

716
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
like with all tools you don't want to

717
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,799
rely

718
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,159
a hundred percent on the tool but i like

719
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,200
this tool because it's very easy to use

720
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,760
for beginners and it gives you an idea

721
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,360
of all the different places you can

722
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:31,919
search

723
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,919
it's gonna look a lot of different

724
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,400
places for you so you don't have to

725
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,559
think about where you need to go when

726
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,240
you're first starting out which can be

727
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
really overwhelming

728
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
so as a beginner i would definitely

729
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,440
recommend using a tool like spider foot

730
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
to make things easier for yourself when

731
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,399
you're first starting out

732
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,600
so after you've run your spider foot

733
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
search or you've searched in other

734
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
places and you've

735
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,480
found some breached accounts you may be

736
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,919
wondering where can you go to get some

737
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,440
passwords

738
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
there are many different places to go to

739
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,559
look for

740
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,279
breech dumps you can look in the dark

741
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,440
web you can look on

742
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
pastebin there are lots of places but

743
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,679
there's one place that's very easy to

744
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,640
search

745
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,400
my research right now has a fantastic

746
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
database he's put together a search page

747
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,240
it's available from a standard web

748
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
browser it's free you don't have to sign

749
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
up for anything

750
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,000
his goal is to make the sale of breach

751
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
data obsolete by posting it as soon as

752
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,960
he can

753
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
openly and for free

754
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,600
it just happens to be a really great

755
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,799
place to go look if you're doing an

756
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,799
oasis investigation as well

757
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,320
the data can be really helpful for

758
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,159
investigators to have

759
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,559
but please don't try and log into the

760
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,840
accounts this could hinder their

761
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,640
investigation

762
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
and it's illegal

763
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,559
reverse image search tools are also

764
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
great resources to try

765
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,480
um often a missing person's poster will

766
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,159
include a picture and it's taken by a

767
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
friend or a family member

768
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
so searching that picture can return

769
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
associated accounts

770
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
additionally associated social media

771
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,080
accounts may contain

772
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
images that are posted on other accounts

773
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
as well and searching those images can

774
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,919
help locate other accounts

775
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,440
there are lots of tools to use for

776
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
reverse image search i find that 10i is

777
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
my go-to most often

778
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
google reverse image search is really

779
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
good but it's going to return

780
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,200
a lot broader of content to you so using

781
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,640
a more focused search sometimes can be

782
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
more helpful

783
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
i typically do an image search when i

784
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,159
don't know where to start

785
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,240
if i'm striking out elsewhere or as an

786
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,159
extra to see what else i can find as a

787
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,360
trail starts to run cold

788
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
sometimes what we're looking for is very

789
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,520
easy to find and tools like spiderfoot

790
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
and maltico are overkill

791
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,960
more often than not i'll start out with

792
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
a really simple google search looking

793
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,320
for someone's facebook page or twitter

794
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,159
accounts or anything else that i can get

795
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,159
with just their name and hometown

796
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,559
or just their email address from there i

797
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,159
dig into their social media accounts by

798
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,679
logging into one of my stock accounts

799
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,640
and i'm going to talk to you a little

800
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,760
bit about how to create those in a

801
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,279
minute

802
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,919
for example one of my end users received

803
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,400
a

804
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,320
very inappropriate email with racist and

805
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,159
threatening content personally directed

806
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,080
at them and their family

807
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
the person sending the email used a

808
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,279
protonmail account which is often done

809
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,960
when someone wants to hide who they are

810
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,880
fortunately for me and unfortunately for

811
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
them they had used this account on

812
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,200
this account name on other accounts so i

813
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
was able to use a username search site

814
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,720
to track down their other accounts

815
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
i found their blog and from their blog i

816
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
was able to get their actual name

817
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,360
then i used that to search facebook both

818
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,400
their facebook

819
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
and their blog account contained similar

820
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,080
racist information

821
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,960
their facebook account also contained

822
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,640
their physical address

823
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,120
so i was able to package all of that up

824
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,840
and get

825
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,480
that to the local pd to help protect my

826
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,039
user

827
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,120
in just a few minutes and no fancy tools

828
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,400
needed it's not

829
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,039
always that simple but sometimes it is

830
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,840
that easy

831
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,600
following basic opsec is really

832
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
important when we're when we're

833
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
performing ocean work especially if

834
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,840
you're finding people

835
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,760
because of the nature of the many sites

836
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,919
that you'll visit for example facebook

837
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,279
and twitter

838
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
if you search a user on facebook and

839
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,600
then you click on their account it's

840
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
going to recommend you to them

841
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,840
as a friend and you don't want that to

842
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,720
happen

843
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,399
you don't know who these people are in

844
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,760
most cases we don't know why they've

845
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,520
gone missing they could be abducted or

846
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,279
they could be in abusive situations we

847
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,399
just don't know

848
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,360
um and in the case of a malicious email

849
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,799
you don't want that person coming back

850
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,520
on you you

851
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,840
we already know that they're unstable

852
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,799
so we don't want any of our social media

853
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,120
stuff messing with what we're looking at

854
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,640
the way that i like to think about it is

855
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,000
you wouldn't walk through the middle of

856
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
a physical crime scene investigation

857
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
so don't walk through the middle of a

858
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
digital investigation

859
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
when you're finding a person it's

860
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,960
important to remember you're not trying

861
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
to prone accounts

862
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,840
you're trying to get information about

863
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,159
where that person is or who someone is

864
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,320
or who's behind a user account

865
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,600
these types of investigations are

866
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,679
commonly referred to as passive recon or

867
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,720
no touch

868
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
they're not invasive meaning you don't

869
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,919
attempt to interact with the target

870
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
or their family or friends we don't use

871
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,000
any illegal hacking techniques and we do

872
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
not try and log into the accounts

873
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
the reason that we do this is that if

874
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,039
you're looking for a missing person

875
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,480
it could be really upsetting to the

876
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,399
family to see that account active again

877
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,520
and then find out that it wasn't

878
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,720
actually them

879
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,120
it could disrupt other investigations it

880
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,000
could also tip

881
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,440
off the person into not using the

882
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,880
account they're still posting from which

883
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
could create a dead end for an ongoing

884
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,679
investigation

885
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,919
that's not a good idea either

886
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,679
adversaries are obviously going to use a

887
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,720
legal account

888
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
illegal techniques and their goal is to

889
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
use ocean to gain access to systems and

890
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,520
accounts so it is important to

891
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,640
understand

892
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,200
both techniques but for our purposes we

893
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,559
shouldn't be doing anything illegal

894
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,159
two things that i would strongly

895
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,760
recommend when doing an investigation as

896
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,320
a vm

897
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,640
and using a vpn i don't recommend you

898
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
use your corporate vpn

899
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
your work would probably agree with me

900
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,240
as well you can roll your own vpn if you

901
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,960
want to

902
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,640
i use proton and i know a few

903
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
researchers that use brave

904
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,159
nord and a pia whatever you use it is

905
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,919
best practice to attempt to connect from

906
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,919
the area of the person you're searching

907
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,559
for is sometimes that's not possible

908
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,320
because connections in that area don't

909
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,480
allow social media connections

910
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
in this case you could use a proxy or

911
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,159
you could just connect from another

912
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,120
location

913
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,480
it's unlikely that you're going to be

914
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
tracked back but it is a best practice

915
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,240
not to mix your personal connection with

916
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
an investigation

917
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,080
it's also best practice to use a

918
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
dedicated machine that you do not use

919
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
for your personal or work use

920
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,320
fat i find can be a barrier for many

921
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,880
when competing in a ctf

922
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,039
i've always used a well isolated vm

923
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,559
because an extra machine is just out of

924
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,559
reach for me

925
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,240
when i do use ozone at work for an

926
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,080
investigation i do have a dedicated

927
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,360
workstation for that

928
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,120
and i would insist on a dedicated

929
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,200
machine for an actual investigation but

930
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,240
for a ctf

931
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
if a dedicated machine is not within

932
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,399
your means an isolated vm

933
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,840
will will cut it um using a vm

934
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,679
will help ensure your social media

935
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,120
information and broader browser

936
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,039
information is not going to spill into

937
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,480
your investigation

938
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,200
i do say this with uh one caveat if

939
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,240
you're gonna do

940
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,520
dark web or anything with tor it is

941
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,279
really important to use a separate

942
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,039
machine you don't want to mix that with

943
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,720
your work machine or with your personal

944
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,000
machine where you might do your banking

945
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,600
make sure you have a separate machine

946
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,840
for that

947
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
it is really important to protect your

948
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,399
identity by not using any personal

949
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,840
social media accounts to search for

950
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,720
people

951
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,399
as i said before we don't know what

952
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,159
their situation is

953
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,919
with these people and we don't want any

954
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,600
of that going back into our personal

955
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,039
lives

956
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,279
um a sock puppet account is a fake

957
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,120
identity we use for recon

958
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,799
i strongly recommend creating stock

959
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,320
puppet accounts when investigating

960
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,840
social media

961
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,559
accounts

962
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,720
so how do you create a sock puppet

963
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,919
safely

964
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,519
when you create a sock puppet also

965
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,279
commonly referred to as a sock

966
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,799
you should be doing it from an isolated

967
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,399
system like a vm

968
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,279
ideally behind a vpn some social media

969
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,720
sites won't allow you to do that like

970
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
facebook there are a few ways around it

971
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,960
one is a burner cell for verification a

972
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,039
burner cell is a throwaway cell phone

973
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,480
and number that does not register back

974
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,799
to you um

975
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,559
you can also use a proxy service that

976
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,000
tricks facebook into thinking you're at

977
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,840
a residential ip

978
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,519
and in the past i've used public wi-fi

979
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,200
to set up stock accounts as well

980
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,320
don't use your work wi-fi for a ctf you

981
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
don't need to be quite as rigorous

982
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,640
i have set them up for my home wi-fi in

983
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,799
a pinch but you want to make sure you're

984
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,799
not using your ctf socks for

985
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,880
actual investigations if you have an

986
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
investigation that's going to present

987
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,760
evidence to

988
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,080
um to your worker or for a situation

989
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,279
like that you want to make sure you're

990
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,000
doing it the right way

991
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
um because we're doing an investigation

992
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,039
and we're not doing long-term recon i

993
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,559
don't put a whole lot of effort into

994
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,840
making my socks

995
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,519
i'm not trying to infiltrate groups or

996
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,440
target accounts i just want to look at

997
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,480
them safely

998
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,080
so you don't need a bunch of friends or

999
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,760
posts to make your stock look convincing

1000
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,960
unless you really want to put that kind

1001
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
of time into it you just need enough to

1002
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,120
keep them from getting shut off

1003
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
you want to generate a name and a

1004
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,320
picture for your profile this person

1005
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,000
does not exist is a great place to snag

1006
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,279
a fake picture from

1007
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,799
if you want your sock to be a little bit

1008
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,320
more convincing though you'll want to do

1009
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,919
a couple edits on the photo because all

1010
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,200
of the pictures kind of have a tell to

1011
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,080
them

1012
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,440
and you'll want to use fake name

1013
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,360
generator or something like that

1014
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,799
or you can just make up a name that

1015
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,840
doesn't tie back to you

1016
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,679
keeping your socks alive and organized

1017
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,440
can be a challenge i use an excel

1018
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,480
spreadsheet to organize my socks

1019
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,159
um so that i can make sure that i log

1020
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,840
into them from time to time to keep them

1021
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,399
alive

1022
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,720
and that i know who they are because if

1023
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,080
you have a couple sometimes it gets

1024
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,360
confusing

1025
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,279
um i use my burner phone to access my

1026
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,679
stock accounts you should never log into

1027
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,120
your own accounts

1028
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,720
on the device you use to manage your

1029
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,880
socks if you log into a personal account

1030
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
on your burner it is no longer your

1031
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,679
burner and you have tainted your stock

1032
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,880
accounts

1033
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,279
you should not have your friends your

1034
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,960
socks be friends

1035
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,399
and you should not be friends with your

1036
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,799
sock when you create

1037
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,880
your sock follow some obvious accounts

1038
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,080
and groups political

1039
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
political accounts actors sports

1040
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,600
professionals and so on are great

1041
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,720
choices

1042
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,279
um and the platform will usually suggest

1043
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,640
them to you based on your preferences

1044
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,919
when you sign up for the account so it

1045
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,320
makes it really easy

1046
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,240
when you're creating your stock and

1047
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,760
following accounts think about

1048
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,279
what you're going to use your sock for

1049
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,519
and who your targets might be

1050
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,679
and try and build your sock around that

1051
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,919
so for example if my sock is a 19 year

1052
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:02,880
old female

1053
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,000
i might follow bts

1054
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,399
but maybe not so much if my sock is a 60

1055
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,960
year old man

1056
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,480
one of the ways i use my ocean skills is

1057
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,399
by completing by competing in trace labs

1058
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,599
capture the flag events

1059
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,960
um there is one tomorrow

1060
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,079
there are um certainly people out there

1061
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,440
who do this for a living and who are

1062
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,199
much better at this than i am

1063
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,679
but i found that this is something that

1064
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,800
brings me some joy

1065
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,079
during all of this during covid like all

1066
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,040
of us

1067
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,239
i haven't been able to spend a lot of

1068
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,159
time with my friends and so competing in

1069
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,800
a ctf

1070
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,960
is a really good time that i get to

1071
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,000
spend with them

1072
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,079
and we get to work together towards a

1073
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,679
common goal for good

1074
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,679
it helps bring me a little bit of peace

1075
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,800
in all the chaos

1076
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,879
to know that i can use my analytical

1077
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,560
skills and my time

1078
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,480
to help other families in need and i can

1079
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
do it safely from my own home

1080
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,400
with very little coveted exposure um

1081
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,800
the sadness of the situation aside trace

1082
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,079
labs puts together at

1083
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,240
really incredible events and the

1084
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,200
community is

1085
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,359
really helpful their slack channel is

1086
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,440
amazing

1087
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,960
they also have ongoing monthly

1088
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
investigations you can

1089
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,240
assist with if you choose to

1090
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,119
so in summary

1091
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,720
it's really easy to get started with

1092
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,160
osin and a lot of people

1093
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,599
see that term and they get really

1094
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,000
intimidated if you can google you can do

1095
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,520
this

1096
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
all you need are the tools to keep you

1097
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,440
safe like a vm or a separate machine

1098
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,079
a vpn and a desire to dig for virtual

1099
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,800
needles in a haystack

1100
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,480
while i've been researching people and

1101
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,640
companies and other entities

1102
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,680
using ocean for years i only got into

1103
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,119
searching for people at the lair eight

1104
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,640
conference in providence rhode island

1105
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
two years ago

1106
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,960
since then i've competed in several ctfs

1107
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,560
and consulted on cases related to

1108
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,839
domestic violence and revenge

1109
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,520
pornography

1110
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,280
none of this is terribly complicated

1111
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
it's a really good skill to grow and it

1112
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,280
translates really well into your day job

1113
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
if you want to start using ocean as part

1114
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
of your security program

1115
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,240
staying organized throughout the

1116
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,640
investigation has always been my biggest

1117
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,720
challenge

1118
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,320
because the information out there is

1119
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,880
just so vast so i hope that the tools

1120
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,640
that i've shared with you

1121
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
help keep you organized and give you a

1122
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,160
place to at least get started

1123
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,520
awesome thank you so much um

1124
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,000
i wanted to say uh your talk has been

1125
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,240
extremely popular in the chat

1126
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,400
with a lot of people asking about the

1127
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,960
the links that you shared and the tools

1128
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,720

1129
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,000

1130
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,359

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,200
people getting in touch with you uh

1132
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,880
with their questions because it's

1133
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,480
already out there but as you can see on

1134
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,599

of knowledge and i love watching the

1139

talk because there's so many things that

1140
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,160
over time you kind of

1141
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,000
move away from them then somebody

1142
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
reminds you that you know maybe you used

1143
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,680
to do that or it's out there and you're

1144
