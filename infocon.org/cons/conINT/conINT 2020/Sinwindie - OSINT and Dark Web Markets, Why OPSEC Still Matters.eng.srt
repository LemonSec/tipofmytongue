1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
well everybody uh i am absolutely

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,679
delighted

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,680
to be joined by sid windy with his

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,040
amazing talk which will

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
will be an amazing talk um on ocean and

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,599
dark web markets

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,799
why opsec still matters so the floor is

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,239
also doing windy and

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,520
uh welcome hey

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,880
stu thank you so much for the

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
introduction uh

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,279
so thank you everybody for joining me uh

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,720
as stu said this is actually my first

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,599
public talk i am really excited um

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,640
and so we're going to look at ocean and

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,760
dark web markets and kind of show why

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,280
you know despite being on dark web

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,840
market

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
your operational security really does

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
still matter

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,239
so just a little bit about me first um

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,200
i'm an ocean practitioner i come from a

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
traditional intelligence background

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,199
and i spent most of my career sort of

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,800
bouncing around from

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,719
uh different parts of the public sector

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,399
different military government and law

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
enforcement agencies

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,399
and so more recently i've actually

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,479
switched over to the private sector

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
where i'm currently a strategic analyst

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
for a major tech company

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,119
and there i focus on a particular subset

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,840
of cybercrime

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
i don't really have much of an online

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
presence however your best bet is to

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
find me on twitter

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,280
under the same handle as sendwindy

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
and on the bottom there you know we

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,040
gotta have the disclaimer

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,560
keep in mind as we go through this

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
everything in this speak

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,119
this talk it's my own views my own

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,880
opinions my own comments

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
and it doesn't represent anyone that i

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,079
may or may not have worked for at any

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,000
point in my career

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,799
all right so first off what is the dark

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,079
web market

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,240
uh well in the simplest terms it's

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
exactly as the name implies

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
uh it is a marketplace that is hosted on

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,799
the dark web

54
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
and so these type of markets are often

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
attracted to dark web platforms

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
especially with tor partly due to the ip

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
anonymization that tor provides

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
and so it makes it a little bit more

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
difficult for law enforcement to

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,119
identify their targets

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,119
these marketplaces also tend to heavily

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,959
rely on cryptocurrencies

63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,800
rather than say you know traditional

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
debit or credit cards

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
uh to make that money trails a little

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
bit more difficult though

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
not impossible for investigators to

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,599
follow

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,599
and while these marketplaces might

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
contain some legitimate goods and

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
services

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
instead honestly they tend to be stuck

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
to the brim with more illicit items

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,760
things such as drugs malware

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
fake identity documents uh counterfeit

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,040
banknotes

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,000
user data passwords hacked and cracked

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
accounts you know

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
those sort of things and so i feel like

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
there's this common misconception that

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,400
dark web users are generally safe from a

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,879
rest

83
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,200
right because oh hey you know i'm using

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
tor i have encrypted messaging

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
i'm using cryptocurrency you know people

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,959
think that

87
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,560
they're going to be fully protected and

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
they can sort of rest easy simply by

89
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,760
relying on these technological

90
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
safeguards to protect them

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,680
well that doesn't appear to be the case

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,920
there is absolutely no shortage of dark

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,080
web arrest headlines out there

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
so how exactly are these users being

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
arrested

96
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
despite what some people might think

97
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,680
these arrests are not caused by

98
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
usually a flaw or a back door within tor

99
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,480
nor are law enforcement agencies using

100
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,239
some sort of like technological wizardry

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
to identify these users

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,599
and instead it tends to be good

103
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,519
old-fashioned investigative work

104
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
combined with some failures in

105
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
operational security

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
that have led to the downfall of many of

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,159
these dark web markets and vendors

108
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
so keeping that in mind what i want to

109
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,440
do we're going to take a look at three

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,720
case examples

111
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
of different users on the dark web in

112
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,480
which they made some critical object

113
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,280
mistakes

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,879
and then we're gonna follow each one of

115
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
them up with some tips and techniques

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,319
uh that would help a new osun analyst in

117
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,400
exploiting similar opsec mistakes

118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,840
should they choose to pick up an

119
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,360
investigation on a dark web market

120
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
all right so i think honestly it would

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
be a disservice to talk about dark web

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,400
markets

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
and not mention what is arguably the

124
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
most famous of the dark web marketplaces

125
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
so i want to kick the case examples off

126
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,358
with the silk road administrator dread

127
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
pirate roberts

128
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,440
and so the silk road launched back in

129
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,479
early 2011

130
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,080
and it was the first major dark web

131
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
market to really take off

132
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
it garnered a lot of attention both from

133
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
the users

134
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,320
as well as from law enforcement and so

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,120
this attention

136
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
probably played a pretty big role in why

137
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
the original silk road only lasted a

138
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
little over two years

139
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
before the site was shut down by law

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
enforcement and the administrator dred

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
pirate roberts

142
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,800
was arrested so for this case example

143
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,919
we're going to look at one of

144
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
dread pirate roberts more notable opsec

145
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
mistakes which is actually the reuse of

146
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
online identifiers

147
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
and see how it played a role in his

148
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,919
identification and later arrest

149
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
okay so during the course of the

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
investigation into the initial silk road

151
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
marketplace

152
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,479
special agents were just sort of poking

153
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,000
around the internet

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
in an attempt to locate some of the

155
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,039
earliest known references to this dark

156
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
web marketplace

157
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
they managed to locate two threads

158
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,639
posted right around the same time as

159
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,560
silk road's initial launch

160
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
one was on shroomery.org and the other

161
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
one was on bitcointalk.org

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so as you can see they both follow a

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
similar pattern of wording

164
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
almost like an advertisement for the

165
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
silk road marketplace

166
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,080
and they're both made under the same

167
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
username of altoid

168
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,199
and they were both made only about two

169
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,960
days apart

170
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,280
so the language used in these posts it

171
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
almost suggests users looking to attract

172
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,000
visitors

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
or obtain feedback on the silk road

174
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,199
marketplace

175
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,800
with one of these posts even ending with

176
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,639
the phrase let me know what you think

177
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,880
and so i want to point out at this point

178
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
it's not too much of a stretch right to

179
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,919
assume that

180
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
someone posting under two forums using

181
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,919
the same exact username

182
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,280
just posted days apart only talking

183
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
about the same topic

184
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,160
that they could likely be the same

185
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
person right

186
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,080
so a couple months pass altoid comes

187
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,199
back to bitcoin talk

188
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
and he decides to post again however

189
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
this time he's seeking to hire some

190
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
it pros for what he's referring to as a

191
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
quote

192
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
venture back bitcoin startup company

193
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
i'll give you one hint to what that

194
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
startup company is

195
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,479
uh one guess so although provides his

196
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,840
email which is

197
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,280
rossulbrite gmail.com within this post

198
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
so that anyone can interested in

199
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
applying can reach out to him directly

200
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,000
and follow up with an email

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
well we know now that this email address

202
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,919
posted by altoid

203
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,600
was later associated to the silk road

204
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,039
admins real identity

205
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,479
and it was kind of one of those puzzle

206
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,919
pieces that allowed law enforcement to

207
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,880
identify this marketplace administrator

208
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,319
agents were able to pivot off of this

209
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
email address to find albright's other

210
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,759
social media profiles

211
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
some of which contained additional

212
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,960
information that sort of corroborated

213
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
the suspicion

214
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
that albright was indeed dread pirate

215
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
roberts

216
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
and so one of the bits of information

217
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
that really strengthened this theory was

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,560
this

219
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,240
apparent shared interest for the mises

220
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
institute

221
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
and dread pirate robert's signature on

222
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
the silk road forum

223
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
included a link including a reference to

224
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
the mises institute

225
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
well investigators also observed while

226
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
looking into the ross albright email

227
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,599
that the google plus account and the

228
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
youtube account associated

229
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
also included a playlist that oddly

230
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
enough had a video

231
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,240
posted by the mises institute and so

232
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
you know admittedly this is all very

233
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
circumstantial however having some of

234
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
these threads

235
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
along with some other things to pull on

236
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
it allowed law enforcement to eventually

237
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,319
put albright under surveillance and

238
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
they were able to actually confirm him

239
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,560
as red pirate roberts later on

240
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,360
so knowing this uh let's take a look at

241
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,840
how

242
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
we can take some similar steps to

243
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,199
collect and pivot off of

244
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,879
very similar breadcrumbs in our own

245
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,680
investigations

246
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,520
so as we saw in our albright example

247
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,599
users tend to reuse identifiers

248
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,759
whether it's usernames email addresses

249
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,080
whatnot across different platforms

250
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,319
and this could occur for many you know

251
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,440
many reasons

252
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
it might be just due to laziness it's

253
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,560
convenient to reuse something you

254
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,680
already have you don't want to make a

255
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
new account

256
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
but at the same time it could also be

257
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,759
due to maybe this prestige or some

258
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,879
trustworthiness

259
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,560
that you established under that moniker

260
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,919
previously

261
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
and this this is actually particularly

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
true on the dark web where

263
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
your reputation especially as a vendor

264
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,360
means everything

265
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
and so because of that you're going to

266
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
be less likely to change your moniker as

267
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
you move from marketplace to marketplace

268
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
now knowing this we can actually search

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
for similarly used usernames and emails

270
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,720
to locate

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,040
additional accounts for our target where

272
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,720
perhaps they practice less than ideal

273
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
opsec

274
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
and for dark web market identifiers we

275
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,399
don't really need to treat them much

276
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,920
differently than those we already run

277
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
across on the surface web

278
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
and instead we can actually fall back on

279
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,519
some tried and true methods

280
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
for example we can use username

281
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,959
enumeration tools something such as

282
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,160
what's my name

283
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
to locate the same username on a variety

284
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
of different platforms

285
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,120
and i've also found that a simple query

286
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
of that same username in quotations

287
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
you know run across a couple different

288
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
search engines tends to help

289
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
catch many of those that these

290
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
enumeration tools might have missed

291
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
for email reuse you can also do the same

292
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
throw it into quotes

293
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
across a couple search engines i also

294
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
find it's a very good idea to remove the

295
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
domain at the end of the email

296
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,959
and treat that as a username as well

297
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,360
for direct email reuse you can also

298
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
query

299
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
some specific email lookup tools

300
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,000
something such as

301
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
melissa's data or that's them

302
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,519
one thing i do want to point out that is

303
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
different though about a dark web target

304
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
is we have already confirmed that they

305
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
have a dark web presence

306
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,760
right you know considering we originally

307
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,600
ran across them on the dark web

308
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,000
so for this reason i would also suggest

309
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
running any of these identifiers you

310
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,240
find

311
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
through dark web search engines

312
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
something maybe like torch

313
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
or recon and also be sure to check the

314
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,200
usernames on dread as well

315
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,399
just to make sure you're covering all

316
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,480
your bases

317
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
and then once you've located all the

318
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
pieces uh all the places

319
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,160
in which a target exists both on the

320
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
clear net as well as on the dark web

321
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
then you can really start digging deeper

322
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
into these profiles and their posts

323
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,519
to gather additional information to

324
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
pivot off of

325
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
okay so next up our next case example

326
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
was actually from alphabay

327
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,480
and just for some quick background alpha

328
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,079
bay launched back in 2014

329
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
it lasted up until around 2017 and it

330
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
was actually seized along with a number

331
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
of other dark web markets as part as a

332
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,920
big sweeping operation known as

333
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
operation bayonet

334
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,040
and following silk road seizure a number

335
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
of dark web marketplaces kind of popped

336
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,480
up to take its place

337
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
and during this sort of you know dark

338
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,200
web marketplace boom that was occurring

339
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,399
they tried to learn from their

340
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,800
predecessor's mistakes and

341
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,480
many started incorporating or enforcing

342
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
the use of some additional security

343
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
methods

344
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,640
to try and prevent any further seizures

345
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
arrests from occurring on their specific

346
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
platforms

347
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,240
and these methods vary from marketplace

348
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
to marketplace

349
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,279
it could be something as simple as

350
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,880
utilizing a more anonymous payment

351
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,440
method

352
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,800
uh maybe something such as the

353
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
cryptocurrency monero

354
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
which doesn't have the easily trackable

355
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
public ledger like bitcoin does

356
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,600
or maybe they require their users to

357
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
encrypt all correspondence

358
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,560
using pretty good privacy or pgp and

359
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,519
that's actually what we're going to

360
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
focus on for our next case example

361
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,160
so even today many many marketplaces

362
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
rely heavily on pgp

363
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
to encrypt the correspondence between

364
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
the buyers and the sellers

365
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
and this is a sort of mitigate the risk

366
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,959
of data leakage

367
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,639
uh the idea is you know should law

368
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
enforcement intercept the messages

369
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
or even seize the server they that

370
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
they're sitting on

371
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
that they wouldn't be getting this huge

372
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
treasure trove of plain text messages

373
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,279
they might have identifiable content

374
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
something such as the addresses used for

375
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,959
shipping

376
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,200
but at the same time this also opens up

377
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
an additional avenue and an additional

378
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,399
point of exploitation for ocean

379
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
investigators

380
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
and one such vendor that kind of learned

381
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
this the hard way was the alpha bay

382
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
vendor dark apollo

383
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
now this particular vendor was offering

384
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
heroin and cocaine on alpha bay

385
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,360
and like most vendors they they posted

386
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,639
their public pgp key

387
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,920
so that customers could encrypt the

388
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
messages they were sending to them

389
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,200
however dark apollo made a very fatal

390
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
flaw when he set up his key pairs

391
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
and he generated them using an email

392
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
address

393
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,760
that when you remove the domain actually

394
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,040
match some of those other clearweb

395
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
social media handles

396
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
and this is actually one of the reasons

397
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
i suggest you know removing the domain

398
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
from the end of the email and treating

399
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
it as a username

400
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,040
so after extracting the email address

401
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
from the public pgp key

402
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,240
law enforcement were able to find

403
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,079
similar handles on twitter

404
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,880
facebook instagram that not only

405
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,480
belonged to dark apollo

406
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,959
but it contained his real name and his

407
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,079
current location information

408
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,120
as well now

409
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
let's take this particular case example

410
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
of dark apollo and i want to use it to

411
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,440
walk through the same steps

412
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
to show just how you extract this

413
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,079
information from a public pgp key

414
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
so for starters you need a public pgp

415
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,680
key

416
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
and you can get this a number of ways

417
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,120
some vendors might include this on their

418
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,160
storefront

419
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,279
in their forum signature if not you can

420
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,560
actually also search for

421
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,440
a pgp key if you know the username via

422
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,920
the

423
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
recon dot onion website and luckily

424
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,079
enough for us

425
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,079
dark apollo's public pgp key is still

426
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800
available here via recon

427
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
so as you see on the the right there

428
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,160
that ptp key

429
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
where it says begin pgp key public key

430
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
block

431
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,880
and it is cut off but you're going to

432
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
want to copy all of that text

433
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
into whatever the text editor of your

434
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
choices

435
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,440
and once you do that you're going to

436
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
want to save that as a dot asc file

437
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
and so from here you can extract the

438
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
email or whatever other information was

439
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,079
given

440
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
when the user generated the pgp key

441
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,880
pairs by simply importing that asc file

442
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
into software

443
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,639
something like cleopatra maybe or you

444
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,320
can also extract it via the command line

445
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
depending on your operating system so

446
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,600
for example

447
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,240
on a db machine you can simply open the

448
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
terminal and run the command gpg

449
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,240
dash dash import and then point it to

450
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,959
the location.asc file

451
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,959
and so despite many dark web users now

452
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,079
being fully aware

453
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,680
that there are risks associated with

454
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,519
including real information here

455
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,519
i still regularly find legitimate

456
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,880
clarinet emails using this simple

457
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
technique

458
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
and that being said because a real email

459
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
is not required here

460
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,199
users might pick a fake email they might

461
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:05,600
put

462
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,279
a red herring email you might find

463
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
gibberish

464
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
and i personally have seen my fair share

465
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,079
of not so nice messages they've been

466
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,279
left for investigators

467
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
all right and and finally for our last

468
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
case example we got a vendor here known

469
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,360
as cannabars

470
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,880
who was on both dream and hanson

471
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
marketplaces

472
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,680
now you know canon bars i mean he

473
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,199
offered the gamut of drugs

474
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,240
everything from marijuana codeine

475
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
xanax crystal methamphetamine uh he

476
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,839
he had quite a bit of stuff on these two

477
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,600
marketplaces and a number of factors did

478
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
play into his identification

479
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,639
a lot of traditional undercover

480
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
purchases were done

481
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
they traced some of its bitcoin cash

482
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,560
outs but i want to focus on a very

483
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,360
particular

484
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,839
photo that the vendor had posted

485
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
so the initial investigation in canada

486
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
bars began on dream marketplace

487
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
and during this investigation one thing

488
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,000
that the investigator noticed

489
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,839
was that canada bars actually had a

490
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,600
review on dream market

491
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,079
from what appeared to actually be a sale

492
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:10,959
of

493
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,160
on honza market and so prior to this

494
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,079
investigation the dutch police had

495
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,360
actually arrested the administrators of

496
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,240
hanza

497
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,839
they had seized the servers and they

498
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,440
were running this marketplace for about

499
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,320
a month or so

500
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,639
as sort of a honeypot to collect any

501
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,759
additional information to make more

502
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,959
arrests

503
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
so having known this the investigator

504
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
looking in the can of bars reached out

505
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
to the dutch counterparts

506
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,120
seeking you know any information they

507
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,399
might have on this particular target

508
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
so the investigator sends the request

509
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,680
out gets a response back and while

510
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
sifting through all this data

511
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,040
they came across a request from a

512
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,800
potential customer which was sent to

513
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,839
canada bars

514
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,600
asking him for some additional photos of

515
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
the marijuana he was selling and

516
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,839
in response to this the vendor links an

517
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,600
imager album containing some additional

518
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,720
photos

519
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,240
now as you can see from the photos on

520
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
the screen here these images

521
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
at least don't have a whole lot of

522
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
information that we can pivot off of

523
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
they pretty much just show the product

524
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,280
only however

525
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,039
in the same imager album there are a

526
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,319
couple more photos in which

527
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,760
canon bars is actually seen holding the

528
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,240
marijuana in his hand

529
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
so you know the photos you guys are

530
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
seeing here do not do them justice

531
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,079
they are of a pretty high resolution

532
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,439
good quality

533
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,959
and so what law enforcement did they

534
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,720
downloaded the high resolution photos

535
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,640
from imager and they submitted those

536
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
images to the forensic lab

537
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
the lab then analyzed the fingerprints

538
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,160
in the photo and found that they

539
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
actually matched

540
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,960
fingerprints already on file for candle

541
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,640
bars from a prior arrest that was made

542
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
and so since these photos are still

543
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
publicly available what i want to do is

544
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,559
we're going to go through some of the

545
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,880
steps that i took the using nothing more

546
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
than open source software

547
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,799
to extract these fingerprints from these

548
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
photos

549
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,919
and i do want to point out that although

550
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,440
the fingerprints are known to belong to

551
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
candlebars

552
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
i have still partially redacted them a

553
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,520
bit just to give him a little bit of

554
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,720
privacy

555
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
however you should still be able to see

556
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,919
enough of these images that you can

557
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,919
follow along with how each step looks

558
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
in order to replicate it yourself should

559
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
you choose to

560
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,600
all right and before we get started i do

561
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
think i need to reiterate here

562
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,960
you do need a high resolution photo for

563
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
this technique

564
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,520
this is not csi miami right zoom enhance

565
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
will not get you very far

566
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
if the fingerprint information is not

567
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,200
already in the photos

568
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
so step one what we need to do is we're

569
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,640
gonna upload that high quality photo

570
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,760
into the [ __ ] photo editing software

571
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,200
once you've done that you're going to

572
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
actually desaturate the image

573
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,039
and so the reason i do this it's going

574
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,559
to make it easier to see our changes

575
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,679
as we go through me playing the photo

576
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,360
following that we're actually going to

577
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
want to invert this image

578
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
and the reason we're inverting this

579
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
image is because we're actually wanting

580
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
to extract the ridges of the fingerprint

581
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
we're not as concerned about the valleys

582
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
and so if we're going to if we're going

583
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,440
to trace the ridges we want them to be

584
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
the darkest part of this photo

585
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
after that we're going to really crank

586
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,559
up the brightness and the contrast of

587
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,160
the image and as you can see those those

588
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
ridges of the fingerprint are starting

589
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
to kind of peak their way out we're

590
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,840
starting to see them a little bit

591
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
but we can still we can we can still do

592
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
better than this

593
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
so the final step we're going to take in

594
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,440
[ __ ] is to apply a sharpen mask

595
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
and that really makes our ridges pop out

596
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
we're almost there at that point

597
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
um however what we're going to do is

598
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,880
we're going to save this image

599
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,720
and we're going to import it into

600
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,240
inkscape instead

601
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
once we get it into inkscape we're going

602
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
to apply the trace bitmap function to

603
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
the image

604
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,039
and as you can see it just removes those

605
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,200
last bits of gray left and leaves us

606
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
only with the black ridges and the white

607
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
valleys of our fingerprint

608
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,559
it also gives us a vector that we can

609
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,000
resize later for our comparison

610
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
and so that's pretty much the steps that

611
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
we know we're taking to extract this

612
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,720
fingerprint

613
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
but how do we use this information

614
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
so if you have multiple high resolution

615
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
photos which have visible fingerprints

616
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,360
you can extract

617
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,720
this technique can be used to compare

618
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
the two prints for a match simply by

619
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
resizing them

620
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
you know you can overlay them on top of

621
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,799
each other or

622
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,480
lay them side by side see where they

623
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
intersect see where they match up

624
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
uh keep in mind though that due to a

625
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,400
photo's lighting and their shadows

626
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
you're never going to have a perfect

627
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
match right

628
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
and so for this reason i am actually

629
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
more likely to use this technique to

630
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
disprove a possible match

631
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,720
rather than using it to correctly

632
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
identify one of my targets

633
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,400
and as you can see in our example here

634
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
we got two separate fingerprints that

635
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
have been extracted

636
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
when we compare them side by side down

637
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,080
the middle we can see that they

638
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,360
you know they're not in fact the same

639
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,760
print um the bottom does actually match

640
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
up pretty well

641
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,919
but as you move up towards the middle

642
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,200
and near the top you can see that the

643
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,919
ridges

644
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,880
don't quite match up

645
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
and so that's actually all i have in

646
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,200
terms of case studies

647
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
however before i open up for some

648
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,159
questions i do want to leave you all

649
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:50,480
with

650
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,640
a little bit of words of wisdom that i

651
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,240
that i find are applicable

652
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
whether you're an ocean analyst a law

653
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
enforcement officer

654
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,480
uh or even a dark web vendor and that is

655
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,080
simply that

656
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
you know a rest will continue until

657
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,399
opsec improves

658
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,080
and so with that uh yeah thank you guys

659
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,960
for joining me

660
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,039
i'll pass it over to stu to see if we

661
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
happen to have any questions

662
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,360
okay my my uh my jaw just dropped like

663
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,880
literally for the first time

664
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,559
in like a long time when you just did

665
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,480
the fingerprints thing um

666
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
i actually do i don't have no reason to

667
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
but i've always been um

668
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,000
every time i took photos online and it's

669
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
on social media and stuff i always mask

670
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
out my fingerprints anyway not because i

671
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
have anything to hide

672
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
but because i don't want someone else

673
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,480
looking at fingerprints as a way of

674
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
identifying you things like this right

675
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,080
so yeah i just can't believe people

676
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
don't do that normally

677
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,159
but now i know why they do because uh

678
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,200
wow that was

679
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
that was super impressive um amazing

680
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,080
um okay i've got i've got a question

681
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,200
while i wait

682
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,039
um uh oh there's loads of questions now

683
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,440
coming in which is brilliant okay i mean

684
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
for your first talk can i just say that

685
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,720
was that was

686
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,799
phenomenal that was an amazing talk

687
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,840
thank you very much

688
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,280
thank you if you know if someone wants

689
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,480
to

690
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
to kind of pick up on these kind of

691
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,520
techniques or wants to

692
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,280
to kind of get into you know maybe law

693
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
enforcement investigation things like

694
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,919
this what what should they

695
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,679
start doing to kind of pick up their

696
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,120
skills

697
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
i think for one thing is you should

698
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
really leverage what you already know

699
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,039
um for those who don't know i actually

700
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,799
started off with an art background

701
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,120
that's how i initially went to school i

702
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,720
did art and computer science

703
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
and so when i started looking into

704
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,919
investigative roles i looked into those

705
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,360
that included

706
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,679
you know for one computer science uh i

707
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,400
did lots of

708
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
analysis of like you know code i've done

709
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
i've used some of my art skills to not

710
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,919
only extract fingerprints but

711
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,120
you know extract text from maybe

712
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,200
an image that was a piece of paper that

713
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
was upside down

714
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
and so you couldn't quite see what the

715
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
image on the

716
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,559
piece of paper said but by using some

717
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,919
known photo manipulation techniques i

718
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,520
was able to actually flip the image

719
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
and extract the text to be able to read

720
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,559
it

721
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,000
so i've actually been able to leverage a

722
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,679
lot of my not

723
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,600
so much investigative techniques and

724
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,159
skills but brought them over

725
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,919
when i started doing investigations so i

726
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,440
think leverage what you already know

727
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
yeah that's amazing yeah our background

728
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,760
that would be really really useful for

729
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,240
this

730
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,320
um amazingly so um rags got a question

731
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,960
as well

732
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
um i thought i might switch my camera on

733
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
so there you go

734
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,280
uh rag's got a question um

735
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
he said to me have you found a greater

736
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
degree in personal risk

737
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,919
uh uh while from investigating.net

738
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,120
actors uh personally no um

739
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,240
and this might be giving a little bit

740
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
away here i'm a huge fan of

741
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,679
misinformation

742
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
so anytime i set stuff up you know i

743
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
like to use usernames for example

744
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,279
to when you search them that you're not

745
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,559
going to get a hit

746
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
uh and altoid with dark with uh dread

747
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,480
power ops is a great example you do is

748
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
google search for altoid

749
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
what are you going to find you're going

750
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,799
to find advertisements in the website

751
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,400
for the altoid candy

752
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
so i'm a big fan of using this

753
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,240
information to kind of protect myself

754
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,039
when i'm doing those kind of

755
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,360
investigations

756
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,919
i also like to use you know the standard

757
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,840
you know virtual machines

758
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,840
tor vpns everything's a burner at that

759
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,559
point

760
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,039
i don't reuse anything whether it's a

761
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,240
username

762
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,039
an email address i also like putting

763
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,559
numbers at the end of everything to make

764
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,840
it a little bit more difficult so i know

765
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
i can't repeat it

766
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,080
um but yeah you know burn everything

767
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,720
after you use it

768
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
yeah absolutely what what's your kind of

769
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,919
best opsec

770
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,320
kind of obviously talking about you know

771
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,159
attackers making upset mistakes but

772
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,840
obviously for investigators you know

773
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,600
what is your kind of top three opsec

774
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,200
kind of dudes i guess um

775
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,520
talk to your family first and foremost

776
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,360
you you would be surprised how many

777
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,559
people

778
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,600
you know especially people who are

779
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,760
breaking the law practice really well

780
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,880
on their own opsec and then you find out

781
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,600
that

782
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
their you know their girlfriend their

783
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,960
spouse

784
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
their you know their mother most of the

785
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,159
time actually

786
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,480
practice this horrible opsec and you can

787
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,080
actually go you know once you pivot to

788
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,279
their accounts

789
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,360
you can find so much information on your

790
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
target that the target is actually not

791
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,720
sharing himself

792
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
so always look for that person who's

793
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,720
like one level removed

794
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
and in my experience it's usually the

795
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
mother who's the best or sometimes the

796
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,159
the ex-girlfriend those are usually the

797
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,679
ones that uh

798
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,640
kind of lead you know lead them astray

799
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,520
other than that

800
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
um so after after you've kind of you

801
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,279
know cleaned up your

802
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
your parents and you know the

803
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,559
girlfriends and such have them clean up

804
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,159
their opsec

805
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,520
another thing i think that's really

806
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,600
really helpful is

807
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
don't reuse your email for personal

808
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,799
things

809
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,159
and sketchy things um if you're going to

810
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,679
do something illegal you know we always

811
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,799
we always joke if you're going to do

812
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,400
if you're gonna break the law only break

813
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,919
one law at a time

814
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,120
and so if you're gonna make an opsec

815
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
mistake only make one at a time because

816
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
when they start stacking up

817
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
um it gets worse and worse and you're

818
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,960
more likely to get caught so

819
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
you know practic practice good hygiene

820
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,080
don't don't

821
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,919
intermingle personal accounts with stock

822
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,840
puppets that kind of thing

823
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,559
um and i think other than those are

824
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,600
probably my two biggest

825
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
yeah i think other things that catch

826
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
people out right especially don't don't

827
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,360
mix your legends basically it's the kind

828
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,480
of key one isn't it

829
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,200
yep yeah i've seen those posts where uh

830
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
it was that employee from um

831
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
bbc or something like that that

832
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,600
basically had a fake account and then

833
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,080
actually logged in and managed to post

834
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,720
the same

835
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
reply to a thread with their with their

836
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
actual live account or something

837
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,000
um yeah it was pretty bad right uh

838
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
okay i'm just gonna check for other

839
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
questions because this is amazing

840
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,679
um i think you scared everyone that's

841
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,559
the problem

842
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,279
no one wants to talk

843
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,720
uh with the crazy fingerprints um

844
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
okay if i can't any more questions

845
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,239
before before we wrap up

846
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,240
no okay

847
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,279
i think everyone's just deleting

848
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,559
themselves off the internet so you can't

849
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,320

seriously and and also you should bring

858
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,320
back the uh the ocean

859
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,360
mondays geolocation stuff but

860
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,159
that's just a personal thing i got i got

861
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
plans for that it's in the works

862
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,000
ah okay more questions coming in now

863
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
they go um

864
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,080
okay some questions now here we go um

865
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,200
how do you build

866
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,240
and age profiles

867
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,480
um unfortunately if you're asking that

868
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,840
right now it's kind of too late

869
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
uh no so um

870
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,799
it depends i know i'm gonna touch

871
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,080
specifically on facebook here because

872
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,679
it's kind of the the worst in my

873
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,039
experience for aging

874
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,039
they usually tend to hit your sock

875
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,559
puppets pretty quick compared to anybody

876
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,440
else

877
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
um i like to use photos

878
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,480
that's not a face and

879
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
you know i know there's that you know

880
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,520
this person does not exist can be

881
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,799
helpful but

882
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,600
i think they're getting a little bit

883
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,360
better at finding those so you know if

884
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,039
you're trying to use a female profile

885
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
you know maybe some high heels if you're

886
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,760
trying to use a male profile you know

887
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,600
i found that like those stock vector

888
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,960
images from like tattoos

889
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,080
work pretty well um and

890
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
you you to keep from getting banned you

891
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,360
need to make it look legitimate

892
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,559
so if you come in early on with a

893
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,640
tor vpn node or something that just

894
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,679
looks sketchy

895
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,000
you're going to get banned pretty quick

896
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,960
so if you can find

897
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
a you know a burner phone number to add

898
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
validation that's going to help out

899
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
if you can make it you know treat it

900
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
like a real account for a little while

901
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,399
like a couple things

902
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,440
maybe add a couple friends you know if

903
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,399
you're able to

904
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,520
just just to kind of make it look a

905
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,919
little bit more legitimate and

906
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,080
don't make too many changes at one time

907
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,840
if you go from having everything based

908
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
out of say

909
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,200
california you put california as your

910
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,960
information for your location using the

911
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,480
california vpn

912
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,320
and then all of a sudden you know you've

913
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,600
pivoted and now you're in the

914
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,960
netherlands

915
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,799
that might get called out um that might

916
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,480
be seen as suspicious so so make

917
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,840
incremental steps as you're as you're

918
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,600
aging your accounts

919
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,880
don't do anything like all at once

920
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,600
that's really good advice um yeah i

921
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,720
create profiles right

922
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,840
for uh for sock puppets things like this

923
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
so you have like a vpn profile for sock

924
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
puppets you can log in from the same

925
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,679
location each time

926
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,000
yep another question as well um

927
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,480
uh it's a bit of a weird one so i'll ask

928
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,279
you anyway have you upset failed

929
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,880
absolutely um

930
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,640
yeah and i don't remember if i've i've

931
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,799
mentioned this before anywhere else but

932
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,480
i made the mistake at one point of

933
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,559
logging in this was years and years ago

934
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,679
i logged into a

935
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,399
a sock puppet and i had not turned on my

936
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,000
vpn when i did so

937
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,679
and so i was coming off from the same ip

938
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,039
address that my personal

939
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,480
at the time was my personal facebook

940
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,880
account and after like

941
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,200
two or three hours i saw my sock puppet

942
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,559
actually pop up in the people you may

943
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,760
know

944
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,840
so so yeah it's it's crazy you know

945
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,039
on the back end some of the things they

946
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
can use to kind of

947
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,440
bring accounts together such as you know

948
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,960
an ip address that says we're in the

949
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
same location so you guys might want to

950
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,440
be friends

951
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,039
yeah and that can also be useful for

952
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,720
when you're investigating people as well

953
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
at the same time absolutely

954
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
all right i think i think that's it for

955
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,480
questions um i i just again

956
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,640
like to thank you amazing talk seriously

957
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,320
um and

958
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,320
um oh there is one more question here we

959
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
go i will do that question then i'm

960
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,480
going to wrap it up

961
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,880
um can you fix identity issues for

962
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,320
people after

963
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,679
creds released

964
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,559
so that's not something that i really do

965
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,760
however

966
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,679
one thing you know going back to

967
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,919
misinformation disinformation

968
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,039
i found that that's been very helpful so

969
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,799
when i when i go to scrub my information

970
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,600
off the internet um

971
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,679
it shows back up you know days or weeks

972
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,799
later because there's a there's another

973
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,840
person who's selling it

974
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,440
you have to kind of get to the source i

975
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,960
found that you know kind of poisoning

976
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,640
the well helps

977
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,360
um if you can when you sign up for stuff

978
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,840
i use

979
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,200
part of my real information and part

980
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
fake information so that

981
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,960
you know when someone pulls a like a

982
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,360
lexus nexus report on me for example

983
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,120
um they're getting hundreds of pages

984
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,799
with different names different email

985
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,000
addresses some of which are real

986
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,159
some which are not um you know it looks

987
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,279
at that point like there's like 40

988
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,760
people living in a one bedroom apartment

989
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,000
so i'm a big fan of poisoning the well

990
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
you know once your information has been

991
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,799
has been linked it's kind of hard to

992
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,960
bring it all back so just kind of

993
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,080
throwing some misinformation

994
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,240
or some disinformation to to kind of you

995
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
know make it a little bit harder to get

996
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,320
the the real information

997
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,399
i think on that note that's a perfect

998
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,840
time to end your talk

999
