welcome back

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,160
to conant track one we are here today

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,759
with will thomas from zyjax

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,360
he's going to talk about using

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,799
intelligence to defend against

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,560
ransomware to me sounds pretty awesome

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:16,880
but

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
let's see how it goes will over to you

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
buddy

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,039
thanks dean uh hello everyone welcome i

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,640
hope you're enjoying conan

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
this is my talk about ransomware and

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,720
gathering intelligence

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,160
i currently work as a security

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,719
researcher for uh scijacks a uk

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,000
based uh threat intelligence company and

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,040
uh i'm a moderator of uh many house club

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,719
and i've really been enjoying the

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,239
conference so

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,920
let's get into it so just to start with

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
everyone loves a good meme especially

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
ones about ransomware

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,600
uh i like the ransomware operator

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,879
starter pack you know it's just

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,640
it's got everything you need there good

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,840
to go for starting your ransomware

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,359
campaigns

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,320
okay so what this is what gathering

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
intelligence looks like

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,199
when you're talking about ransomware

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,960
groups and where what you need to look

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,479
for and where from

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,520
you've got the you know ransomware is

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,080
it's a entire cyber criminal ecosystem

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,200
it's not just

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
one separate groups running campaigns

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
it's it's multiple

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,119
threat actors that specialize in their

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,640
own sectors

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,799
and you know it's divided up between

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
access the actual

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,720
development of the ransomware itself

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
development of the malware

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
and you know using the malware in

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,560
attacks you know all these things can be

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,759
gathered from the different

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
parts of the internet pretty much

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,119
including the dark net

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,759
forums communities such as like cti

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,560
league

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
um social media such as twitter it's

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
always a good source of intelligence

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
uh mainstream mainstream news you know

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,320
reuters

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
and that usually first to report on

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
these major things

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
and uh vendors as well for iocs and

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
and new tactics techniques and

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,399
procedures uh ttps

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,000
once once you have collected all this

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,759
from these sources

62
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,720
you then analyze it and you understand

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,200
what

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
what you're actually dealing with here

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
and uh

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
you know narrative based analysis what's

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,879
what with these groups done before where

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,800
it's come from why is it important

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,239
and then you pass it off as as

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,480
intelligence to your clients

71
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
who can then use it for mitigation of

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
their systems and prevent

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,120
these attacks from actually happening

74
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
so what is ransomware how does it work

75
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
and why is it so

76
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,040
successful um you know kaspersky

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
basically did a

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
pretty good diagram here basically

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
encapsulating everything

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,000
about how these ransomware as a service

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
platforms work

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
uh you know it's different teams working

83
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
together um

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
you know these these groups can be split

85
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
up between access brokers data brokers

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
exploit brokers and the actual malware

87
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
developers themselves

88
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
uh the main one of the biggest issues

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,400
with

90
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,959
ransomware is how they get in so initial

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,000
access

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,560
initial access uh like how do they get

93
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,319
in rdp brute forcing

94
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,800
is uh usually one of the the favorites

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
but you know it also includes phishing

96
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
for malware deployment such as like

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
emote trick bot drydex you know and then

98
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,840
once those malware are in the system

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
they can be sold as access

100
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
to the ransomware gangs and then

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,840
ransomware's deployed on the network

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
um they also exploit remote services

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,599
such as you know vpns

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,640
uh microsoft sharepoint and exchange um

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,159
but you know these groups are so well

106
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,000
funded now that they use

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
zero-day vulnerabilities and they don't

108
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,120
have to develop them themselves they can

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,519
buy them from someone else

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,560
so you know public sector notifications

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
uh you know regarding these ransomware

112
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,879
groups because they are now the top

113
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,799
tier threats you know you know you're

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,720
not so worried about

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
you know nation state espionage

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,319
campaigns as much

117
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,239
as uh you know ransomware because it's

118
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,519
much more likely to happen you're gonna

119
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
get struck with ransomware

120
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,920
and um you know these are organized

121
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,959
cybercrime

122
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,080
groups organized crime um you know the

123
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,560
guy

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,959
in the bottom left here is uh also known

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
as aqua

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,279
the evil corp uh guy he's also known as

127
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,400
the guy with the

128
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
the lambo he's uh he

129
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
uh owes an investigation into him which

130
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,919
i've linked in the references

131
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,960
uh uncovered his wife for instagram

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
for a very uh particular

133
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
logo in her car and very unique

134
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
coloration of the interior

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
and the location and in further

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
investigation into this found out that

137
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,280
she is actually

138
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
connected to one of the heads of the fsb

139
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,720
uh who's

140
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,479
you know pictured there vladimir putin

141
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,120
so these ransomware gangs are actually

142
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,240
really well connected and protected and

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
you know these threats are not going

144
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
away

145
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
so who are the ransomware operators um

146
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
these are

147
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
uh split between cyber crime groups

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,800
from or like mainly from russia and

149
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
eastern europe but you know

150
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,479
those gangs also have connections around

151
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,360
the world you know

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,639
south america uh asia you know

153
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,550
even the americas you know the

154
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,440
[Music]

155
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,720
the uh yeah you also got like the

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,080
state-sponsored groups

157
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
they as as well as cyber crime you've

158
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,479
got the state-sponsored groups that

159
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,479
you know they use ransomware either

160
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
financially but like

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
like from iran and north korea or as

162
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,759
disruption like

163
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,160
um the sand worm team that from the gr

164
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
also known as the gru

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,360
unit um as well as um you know chinese

166
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,479
speaking threat actors

167
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,880
using ransomware such as cold lock and

168
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,680
i'm freezing there and one of the most

169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,400
uh

170
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
successful uh ransomware operators are

171
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
the the combination between the emote

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
downloader trojan the trickbot banking

173
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,919
trojan which is basically a malware

174
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
distribution

175
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,800
network as well uh with and then that

176
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,199
usually leads to the riot ransomware

177
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,840
which has costed organizations millions

178
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
over the years

179
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,680
and then you also have ics and scada

180
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
targeting ransomware

181
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
so like the mega top mega cortexes and

182
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,400
yakins

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
and you know these target your

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
industrial control systems

185
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,560
and you know one when those goes down it

186
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
costs millions of dollars in damages so

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
that's why they target them

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,800
so the largest ransomware attacks of the

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,520
quarter one

190
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,199
quarter three uh to of 2020

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,080
include a whole range of sectors pretty

192
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
much any sector whether

193
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,240
where they can extort the data um you

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
know you've got the travel x1

195
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,520
in early january i think it was new

196
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
year's day they got struck by uh rival

197
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,800
ransomware

198
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,639
and you know that one personally

199
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
affected me because i i went to heathrow

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,240
and i went into the travel x there and

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,759
i could see them all there like using

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,360
their pens and paper

203
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
and you know they're all just stressed

204
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
out and it was horrible you know

205
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,759
so yeah there's a whole range of sectors

206
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
they go after and huge brands that i'm

207
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,240
sure

208
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
you'll recognize their honda cannon

209
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
ubersoft uh uhs

210
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,120
universal health services 400 hospitals

211
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,599
were

212
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,639
affected by that one

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
uh you've got so here are the ransomware

214
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,440
leak blocks so

215
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,319
since november ransomware has been using

216
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,520
um

217
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,639
data theft and extortion hybrid attacks

218
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,759
so you know since since since they've

219
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
began this they will

220
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
not only will they infiltrate your

221
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,039
network they will persist and steal

222
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,919
data for months or weeks or months or

223
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,440
you know override weekend

224
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
and um and then when they encrypt your

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
network they will also extort

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
your extort the data they have stolen by

227
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,240
publishing them on these leak blocks

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
so you've got 14 link blogs here

229
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
and uh they are that there's more the

230
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
i think the ragnarok ransomware that you

231
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,120
just came out two or three days ago

232
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,319
that you know they're coming they're

233
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
popping up here and there all the time

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,039
and the data

235
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,000
exposed in these leaks inc are really

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,879
really really

237
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,120
massive you've got gigabytes of data all

238
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,800
types of sensitive information

239
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,520
card credit cards passports intellectual

240
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,160
property

241
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
emails communication and you know that

242
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,360
just

243
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
it just gets uploaded every single day

244
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,360
um like let's start with the

245
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
uh one of the most infamous ones is the

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,599
maze ransomware they actually started

247
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,720
the data

248
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,519
theft extortion hybrid attack they they

249
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,959
pioneered it and they

250
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
worked with other groups basically uh

251
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
the ragnarok ran somewhere they've

252
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
worked with them

253
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
and they're responsible for attacks on

254
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
canon lg orange this and crap you know

255
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,800
recognizable brands

256
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
so the anatomy of a leak site is uh

257
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
it includes the current leaks uh so

258
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
basically if

259
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,640
if they have encrypted a network they

260
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,200
will then

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
you know try to extort the the customer

262
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,800
or the

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
they call them customers um and into

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
paying the ransom so if the if the

265
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,279
client is still

266
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,240
dealing with the attack um then they

267
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
will publish the data

268
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,519
or threaten to publish the data say like

269
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,600
you have three days until we publish it

270
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
so it's just like an extra bit of

271
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
pressure on them

272
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
and try to really force them to to pay

273
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
out because they don't want

274
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
you know passports of employees and

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,000
emails and passwords and everything

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,959
going out there

277
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
and anyone who doesn't pay it goes into

278
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
the archive so it's there forever

279
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
pretty much and it like even if you took

280
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,680
this one site down

281
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,800
you you can see that you've got your

282
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
duplicate size your tour mirrors

283
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,160
um so you know that data is not going

284
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
away

285
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,839
and here's just an example of a part of

286
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,600
the ransomware as a service offering the

287
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
decryption site

288
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
so once your network's been encrypted

289
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,160
there'll be a note and they're in the

290
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
link there'll be

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
you know a link to the description site

292
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
and this is basically where

293
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
you go to get your files once you've

294
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,600
paid the ransom

295
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,480
and um you know it says there the price

296
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,800
can actually be negotiated like these

297
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
cyber criminals they think they are

298
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
businessmen and they think they can

299
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
uh you know like swindle you out amount

300
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
of money in in

301
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,519
multiple ways

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,640
and here's example of the control panel

303
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
so as i was saying

304
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
the the maze ransomware developers are

305
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
actually the ones who

306
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
create the malware handle the payments

307
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
handle the decryption

308
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
they actually what they will actually be

309
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,120
working with other

310
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
other cyber criminal teams or

311
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,279
individuals or groups

312
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,000
and you know this obscures attribution

313
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,959
because

314
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
every time that something gets hit by

315
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,000
maze you just think oh it's the maze

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,279
ransomware gang

317
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
no actually it's like three four five

318
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,399
however many groups that are using maze

319
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
so i want to do like a bit of a case

320
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
study here of

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
uh my investigation into

322
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
uh a ransomware developer and just sort

323
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,399
of try and

324
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
understand this more and provide it as

325
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,160
intelligence to our clients so

326
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,839
they can understand better like the

327
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,440
threat

328
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,480
and stop it from actually affecting them

329
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,399
so talking about the the thanos

330
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,760
ransomware

331
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,040
uh through ocean i was able to

332
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
you know one day whilst monitoring i get

333
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
a pop-up of these uh

334
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,839
bits of intelligence really um from

335
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,240
security researchers and journalists and

336
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
and what comes up on the on the malware

337
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
forums

338
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,720
um the the developer popped up on

339
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,839
on the 17th of november 2019 saying that

340
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,360
he's very pleased to offer

341
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
a new product so that's interesting and

342
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,200
then

343
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
pivoting off that you can look at the

344
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,800
username and and the tech

345
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,959
text analysis and try and find if it's

346
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,319
been advertised anywhere else

347
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,959
and then you've got this is what we

348
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,560
found basically through pivoting off

349
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,200
that

350
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,680
you're able to look at the usernames

351
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,000
look at the images of the logos on the

352
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,279
profiles

353
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,920
and the titles and you're able to

354
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,800
basically

355
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
build up a picture of this operation and

356
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,959
find out more

357
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,240
more intelligence from doing this

358
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,320
i was able to uncover the ransomware

359
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,639
builder this is actually where

360
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,880
this is the little bit of kit that is

361
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
used to basically create your

362
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
custom version of the thanos ransomware

363
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,560
includes like

364
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,279
what extensions to encrypt and you know

365
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,000
what you actually

366
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
want to append to the to the

367
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
file and then you've got the control

368
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
panel like we saw with mace

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,399
and then also while i was investigating

370
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
this ransomware offer i found that he's

371
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
also developing a banking trojan as well

372
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,200
so he's like a highly skilled veteran

373
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,079
malware developer

374
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,920
and through further pivoting of those

375
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
bits of intelligence we've got the

376
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,040
usernames elsewhere email addresses

377
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,800
forum names you know he's also

378
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,279
responsible for the silver crypter

379
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,720
which is what is used to basically

380
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
further obscure your malware code and

381
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,279
encrypt it

382
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,000
so that it bypasses antivirus and the

383
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
edr and things like that

384
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
and it's also connected to the the the

385
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,519
same account there posted

386
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,600
another information stealer there it's a

387
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
loader and a grabber and

388
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
probably is also advertised in part of

389
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,240
their campaigns

390
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
so here's an example of the ransomware

391
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,079
operator and

392
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
access brokers working together through

393
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
the forums

394
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
you've got access as a service this was

395
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
was like to be called

396
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
where one user will post

397
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,760
all the types of access they have um so

398
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,519
selling that so the post they're selling

399
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,240
network

400
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,880
full access domain admin um you know

401
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,600
you've got

402
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720
the revenue of the company the the type

403
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
is hospitals you know revenue one

404
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,560
billion domain admin

405
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,040
price um and then underneath you've got

406
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,519
the ransomware author who's saying he

407
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,880
vouches for him

408
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,360
and because the access broker and the

409
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
ransomware author are actually both

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
looking for clients and they they are

411
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,160
both offering a service

412
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
so you know this is this is how

413
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,680
the under under underground cyber

414
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
criminal operations work

415
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,199
and the types of access that they offer

416
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,160
includes vpns pulse secure and citrix

417
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,279
those are two very

418
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,160
popular vpns that had very quick hike

419
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
highly critical

420
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,440
vulnerabilities were disclosed early

421
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
this year and last year which have been

422
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,639
used in multiple

423
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
campaigns and then other things like

424
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,240
credentials and

425
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
web shells and and other things like

426
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,319
that

427
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,519
so the other the threat reports are also

428
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,160
important

429
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
when gathering intelligence because you

430
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,519
want to build up a picture you want to

431
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,800
build up the narrative

432
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,680
of what is going on and to support uh

433
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,959
you're looking for what other

434
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,160
firms have found to support your um

435
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
your your hypothesis really and then

436
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,079
you've got

437
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,600
so from here looking through these

438
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,199
reports um who

439
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,519
who you know these firms actually have

440
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,959
sandboxes and

441
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,120
and uh constantly monitoring and that

442
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,399
they have

443
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,480
like detection systems on clients all

444
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
over the world so they're actually able

445
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,279
to pick up samples

446
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,160
very easily and provide really detailed

447
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,920
technical analysis

448
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,320
um so what we also know about the

449
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,079
finance ransomware from here

450
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,639
is that uh it's a ransomware affiliate

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,800
program that's what it calls itself

452
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,519
um it uses aes advanced encryption

453
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,800
standard which

454
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
cannot be decrypted it like it requires

455
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
very powerful uh decryption

456
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
tools to be able to get past that so

457
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,199
and and then you've got uh the targets

458
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,040
the uh mena countries middle east and

459
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
north and africa

460
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,800
from unit 42 there and then other

461
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,160
techniques and capabilities the

462
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
ransomware is capable of

463
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,680
one of the most recent reports from

464
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,519
clear sky said that it's connected to

465
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,800
the muddy water

466
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,639
advanced persistent threat group from

467
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,000
iran so

468
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
we know that these cyber criminals

469
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
actually work with state-sponsored

470
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,519
operatives

471
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,320
uh i put an asterisk there because that

472
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,560
it

473
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,000
it's basically it's unconfirmed but it

474
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
there's a every everything is pointing

475
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
to it

476
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,160
so what and so what have we like

477
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,519
what have we actually learned from

478
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
looking at a ransomware operator

479
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,720
we know that the threat actor is

480
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
responsible for developing distributing

481
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,880
and advertising the ransomware

482
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,680
they are continuously like updating and

483
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,040
developing the ransomware

484
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,160
making sure new features are available

485
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
and to make sure it has a low detection

486
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,359
rating that's always a key

487
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
part that they try to push to their

488
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,720
customers and try to attract customers

489
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
you also so so what what's the point of

490
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,959
this why why do we want to know about

491
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,679
this so

492
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
we know that the the ransomware as a

493
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,079
service market is a growing threat

494
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,439
it's attracting more and more cyber

495
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,839
criminals uh more features will be added

496
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
to the ransomware to attract customers

497
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,320
so one thing that thanos added was an

498
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,640
mbr locker master boot record

499
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,000
locker so basically when like

500
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
one of the winner team uses the mbr

501
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,120
locker on a customer

502
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
or on an organization such as a hospital

503
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,640
something like that

504
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
then it actually deletes the sort the

505
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
actually deletes the software in between

506
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
the operating system and the hardware so

507
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,880
you know

508
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
you can't actually turn on your computer

509
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
once they've hit you with that

510
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,160
and you know the only way out of it

511
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,200
really is paying the ransom

512
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,320
and they also try to add

513
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
uh they're trying to build the community

514
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
up around their services you know it

515
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
there is it does come with the risk they

516
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,280
do

517
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,240
expose themselves to you know the rest

518
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
of the internet

519
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
but you know it comes with the reward of

520
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,480
attracting clients and making money

521
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,280
really

522
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,320
these they're all about making money

523
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,480
and and you know other things we learn

524
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,679
about monitoring

525
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,960
a uh raz like this is that they rely on

526
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,280
communication with their customers

527
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,720
and they and like most net markets the

528
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,280
trust needs to be maintained so you know

529
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
if if a customer goes along and

530
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,000
pays for the ransomware and then the guy

531
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,520
never gives it to them

532
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,120
you know his reputation is lost and

533
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,559
people won't trust him

534
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,840
they won't make any more money

535
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
whilst whilst we also monitor we found

536
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,679
video demonstrations

537
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,320
you know this is it's to prove you know

538
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,799
is to

539
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,880
boost his reputation and prove that it

540
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,960
actually works

541
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,320
um they also were able to receive

542
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
feedback from

543
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,400
from forum users and and other platforms

544
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
so that you know

545
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,720
they a customer will be like i want to

546
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,360
add

547
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,080
i want to make sure that it's got a

548
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,120
custom

549
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,559
encryption algorithm or something like

550
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,160
that so you know they can implement it

551
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
other malware we found offered by the

552
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
ransomware author

553
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,280
uh as i said silver crypto nemesis

554
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,240
uh rem cross uh rats which is uh open

555
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,679
source but i'm pretty sure they modified

556
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,400
it the quasar rats also modified

557
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,440
chimera crypto another crypto and

558
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,880
that unknown banking trojan which you

559
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
are actually yet to see

560
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,960
um we've also got the aliases for the

561
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,720
for the operator as well

562
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
um there

563
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,160
so like i want to talk about one example

564
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,520
of how it goes from access

565
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,559
a sale of access to an example of a

566
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,159
ransomware attack

567
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,159
so it goes from so bank security here

568
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,159
great to account on twitter you know i

569
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,480
really really recommend anyone who works

570
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:12,880
in

571
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
uh threat intelligence to follow this

572
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
account because he's always giving away

573
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,799
good bits of information and for

574
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,360
in this case he was actually able to

575
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,320
provide

576
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,440
you know this actually could have

577
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,880
stopped the ransomware attack on the

578
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,679
bank

579
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,120
he notified he noticed that a forum user

580
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,600
was had access web shell access to a

581
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
bank located in chile

582
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
you know you always have to take these

583
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,720
at a pinch of salt but

584
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,600
you know it's very i know it's very um

585
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,720
it's not always they don't

586
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,039
just post it to you know be a troll or

587
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,320
something like that i'll try and

588
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
bait users and they are actually selling

589
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,679
things trying to make money at the end

590
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,640
of the day

591
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
and if this bit of intel's actually make

592
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,480
able to make it to the

593
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,039
bank in chile they wouldn't have been

594
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,880
hit by reeve or ransomware

595
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,320
banco estado you know like the next day

596
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,679
if you look at the times there you've

597
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,480
got six at six of september 2020 it's

598
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
the 7th of september 2020 if that

599
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
intel was actually able to make it to

600
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
them then they could have

601
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
stopped it so you know that's the is

602
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,200
exemplifies the importance of threat

603
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
intelligence when you're trying to

604
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,159
defend your organization

605
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,480
especially against ransomware which is

606
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,520
one of the biggest threats

607
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
so i just want to you know reflect and

608
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,960

609
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
it's

610
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,679
you know how it's one of the biggest

611
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,200
threats and it's not going away it's

612
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,799
only growing

613
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,640
um and it's that you know they're

614
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
they're modifying their campaigns and

615
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,159
they're trying new things one of the

616
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,880
most recent is they're starting to also

617
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,520
ddos

618
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,360

thank you thank you one question here

627
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,799
straight away from angus red

628
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,400
how do you stay so chill

629
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,039
how do i stay so chill when when do you

630
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,600
when dealing with ransomware

631
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,640
yeah it's um there's one

632
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
i think an incident uh an instant a

633
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
veteran incident responder

634
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,840
said um that there's something called

635
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
the uber ooda loop

636
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,039
it's called the observe orient uh decide

637
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,760
and act

638
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
and then just repeat that process so

639
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
when you're actually in the middle of

640
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,320
dealing

641
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,720
with the ransomware attack because it is

642
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,840
a stressful thing you know your

643
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
organization's gone down

644
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,000
um your computers are locked your

645
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,679
business reputation is a

646
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,039
jeopardy you've got to basically

647
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,720
pull yourself try and pull yourself out

648
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,480
of it and think

649
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,760
uh so you've got to observe and then

650
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,960
you've got to you know do something

651
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
you've got to come up with a plan then

652
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
you've got to decide on the plan

653
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,480
and then act um and then once that

654
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
once you've done that action step back

655
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,799
again observe did it work did it not

656
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
and just just go bit by bit

657
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,679
you know you and one of the most

658
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,200
important parts is having a plan

659
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,880
what what are you gonna do when you get

660
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,559
hit by ransom and i say when

661
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,760
because it it's so so many organizations

662
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,960
are being hit it's

663
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
it's a matter of pretty much a matter of

664
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,159
when rather than if

665
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
nowadays awesome awesome

666
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200

667
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
