a version of this talk before

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,400
or not so i think that we've covered my

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,440
bio but who

88
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
is a is always the question that

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,519
everybody asks about pretty little liars

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,920
so i'm spoiler alerting it and a is me

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,840
in this situation um my name is olith

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,799
organizations out and support them any

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,360
way that you can

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
today we are going over a variety of

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,080
things we're going to start with

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,799
what is a pretext we're going to move

106
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
into discussing influence briefly

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
and then we're going to look at how we

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
can source

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
ocent information and intelligence that

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,799
we can analyze

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,159
and use to create a believable

112
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,519
solid pretext um and we'll look at how

113
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,319
to use

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,159
the information that we find during the

115
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,680
ocean portion

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
to compile a solid pretext and then we

117
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,319
will go over to

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,840
questions and answers and of course if

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
there's anything that you don't get

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,879
answered during this talk

121
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,358
please don't hesitate to reach out to me

122
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,880

or linkedin quick disclaimer

124
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
don't do bad things don't break the law

125
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
none of what you are about to see should

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
be used for any

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
illegal or questionable activities

128
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,800
this information is shared only with

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
the purpose of giving you more skills

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
that you can use

131
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
within the course of your ethical

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,160
assessments against businesses

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,919
so don't get in trouble don't do bad

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,800
things don't get in trouble

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
first off we're going to talk about

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
pretexts what is

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
a pretext the definition of a pretext

138
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
is a purpose or motive alleged

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,520
or an appearance assumed in order to

140
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,000
cloak

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
the real intention or state of affairs

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
so essentially

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
it is a virtual disguise

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,080
or an outward display to conceal

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
your true motives and that is uh the

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,600
latin

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,199
and how that word came together which i

148
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,880
thought was pretty neat that it means

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,759
basically to

150
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,199
weave a disguise i really like that idea

151
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,320
and that's one of the reasons why i

152
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
chose the theme pretty little liars

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,680
because i felt like there was a heck of

154
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,039
a lot of that going on

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,240
during that series so a pretext

156
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
is in my opinion something that you are

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
something that you do your job your role

158
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,919
uh your purpose

159
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,600
and something that you have that's where

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
the ocean comes into play

161
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
is the information that you need to have

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,400
to

163
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,479
substantiate the first two things who

164
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,000
you're pretending to be

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,639
and what that person pretends to do for

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,240
their job every day

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
this is all for the purposes of gaining

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
the something that you need your goal

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
the item of information that you are

170
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
trying to elicit

171
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,160
or pull out of the person that you're

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
speaking to

173
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
or sending an email to because

174
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,039
pretexting really can fall

175
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
into all categories of phishing email

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
and voice elicitation

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,639
smishing which is the the fun word for

178
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,919
sms or text message phishing and all

179
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,639
those things

180
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,520
they all boil down to the one thing that

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,240
you want

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,800
and how do you substantiate who you are

183
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,919
to get that information

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,919
so we're gonna break out the anatomy of

185
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,400
the pretext a little further

186
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,120
the anatomy of a pretext is starting

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
with your

188
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,160
character and then moving into what that

189
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,360
character's role

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
is in the conversation or in the

191
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
situation

192
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,319
and then having the something that you

193
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,520
need

194
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
to create evidence to

195
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
those two facts and this is a little bit

196
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,479
backwards from the way that we're going

197
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,520
to do it today

198
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,800
because i believe that you should

199
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
conduct the ocean first and then use

200
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
that information

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
to determine the character and your your

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,400
job

203
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,319
or your role as a person in the world

204
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
to elicit the information or achieve the

205
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
goal of obtaining the flag

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
or piece of information that you want to

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
elicit or the action that you want

208
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
the user to take basically this is your

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,599
cover story

210
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
now we're going to talk about pretext

211
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
points of failure and unfortunately

212
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
i've seen this happen a lot and it all

213
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,080
comes down to

214
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,520
one main very important thing and that

215
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,720
is preparation so failing

216
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,000
to prepare is preparing to fail

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,759
and i would recommend that you spend

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
the most time preparing for

219
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,400
the engagement um than anything

220
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
else in the whole um you know length of

221
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,319
the project

222
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,599
your ocean and your recon should be a

223
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,720
significant portion of time um to make

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,759
sure that you have

225
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
not only the the information that you

226
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,639
need but that you have a good idea

227
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,759
of the character of your target the

228
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,400
culture

229
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,919
of your target company and a good feel

230
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,400
for

231
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
jargon words and

232
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,160
all of the stuff that's really going to

233
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,879
add

234
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,879
context and validity to your pretext

235
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
confidence is also essential and

236
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
if you have the natural confidence or an

237
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,159
air of confidence

238
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,039
not cockiness but confidence that's

239
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,399
going to go a long way but this is

240
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,560
absolutely something that you can learn

241
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
and i speak from experience because i am

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
a anxious twitchy nervous person

243
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,160
as it is which is why i've really leaned

244
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,040
into

245
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
a more empathetic pretext where i can

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,240
act

247
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
unprepared and nervous and anxious and

248
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
it'll be perfectly in line with how i'm

249
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
really feeling

250
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,959
so confidence and having the knowledge

251
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,680
to back

252
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
up your rebuttals to any objections

253
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
from the target so if they challenge you

254
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
you want to be able to say yeah this is

255
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,519
how you do that

256
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
or this is the place in your computer

257
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,720
that you need to go

258
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,839
to get that information or within this

259
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,120
application um if you want say like the

260
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,839
version

261
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
of a browser or something like that you

262
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,959
want to have that knowledge ready to go

263
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,480
like click on this do that and it's

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
going to add

265
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
a layer of confidence to your pretext

266
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
that will make the user the target feel

267
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
like

268
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,959
you're supposed to be asking these

269
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
questions you can't really ask somebody

270
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,200
to find the version of something

271
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
and not know how to tell them how to do

272
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
that and instill

273
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,959
them with the confidence that you are

274
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,519
supposed to be asking these questions

275
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,160
and then finally i would say you

276
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
absolutely need to

277
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,600
keep it simple just try to eliminate

278
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
any irrelevant details don't do the

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
thing that we're all

280
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
very tempted to do which is just pour

281
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
endless amounts of commentary

282
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,040
into our lies and excuses and

283
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,320
and untruths when your parents asked you

284
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,120
who did

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,519
whatever that broke that thing i know

286
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,560
you gave them a

287
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,519
giant long explanation of excuses don't

288
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,000
do that

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
keep it very simple don't even give them

290
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
a last name if you don't have to

291
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,320
hi i'm bethany from the headquarters and

292
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
i just wanted to talk to you today about

293
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
your computer i'm doing something with

294
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,399
the idt

295
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
department and it looks like your

296
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,920
computer hasn't connected to the vpn in

297
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,279
a while and i just have a list of names

298
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,880
here to contact so we can go over some

299
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,680
things

300
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,720
is sufficient if you give them

301
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,279
the entire backstory that you created in

302
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,160
your head

303
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
you're just going to send their brain in

304
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
too many different directions

305
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
and give them more opportunities to

306
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
object

307
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,279
and to challenge you so keep it simple

308
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,519
so basically this is this is how you can

309
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,480
make sure

310
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,279
that your good lies don't fall apart is

311
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,600
by

312
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,519
keeping these three core things in mind

313
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,480
so the goal of a pretext so the way i

314
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,079
love to explain this is

315
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,560
when you're driving a car you only ever

316
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,839
seem to notice

317
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
that there's a car that's too close to

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
your rear end when it's already too

319
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,959
close to you

320
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,480
and the reason for that is that your

321
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
subconscious is always scanning your

322
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
environment

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,959
um unbeknownst to you to identify any

324
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,640
potential threats

325
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
and it only notifies your conscious

326
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
brain when it's like

327
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,959
help i need an adult somebody make a

328
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,279
decision because this is a problem

329
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,519
and it's identified a threat so you want

330
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
to make sure that

331
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,120
you as an attacker do not

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,920
tip off your target's subconscious that

333
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
you could be a threat

334
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,079
and that is the reason for the pretext

335
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,760
this pretext is a veil

336
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,720
that you're wrapping around your true

337
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,040
intentions and your goal

338
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,519
for what you're trying to accomplish so

339
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
you want to avoid tipping off the target

340
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,480
subconscious

341
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
so that their conscious brain stays with

342
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,480
you and you're essentially

343
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
leading them to do what you'd like them

344
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
to do or tell you what you want them to

345
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,519
do

346
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
and keeping that pretext that bail

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,279
intact

348
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,920
is the goal of the pretext so that's why

349
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,040
it needs to be solid

350
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
well researched you need to be confident

351
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,160
and ready

352
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,000
to counter any objections or challenges

353
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,399
to keep that pretext and that veil

354
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,760
intact it's kind of like having your

355
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,959
mask ripped off

356
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,200
if they figure out that something is not

357
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
quite right

358
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
so on that similar track we're going to

359
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,760
talk about influence

360
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,720
briefly um this this edition will focus

361
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,079
more on the ocean side

362
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,920
so i am kind of speeding through this

363
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
part a little bit

364
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,240
but influence is very important to your

365
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,959
pretext

366
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,760
this is how you're going to elicit the

367
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
information it's the powers of

368
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,560
persuasion and compliance that you

369
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,079
are applying to your pretext

370
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,200
to give it that you know getting the

371
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,639
person over the finish line of

372
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,320
completing the action or giving you the

373
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
information

374
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
this is how you leverage a really great

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,720
pretext

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,680
into results so how do we do that

377
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,880
there are six excuse me there are six

378
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,320
universal principles of

379
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,240
influence i'm going to cover these

380
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
really really quickly

381
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,959
but essentially you are going to want to

382
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,320
use a person's natural

383
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,160
um desire to be led

384
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,199
and follow expert advice by using the

385
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,399
influence factor

386
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,079
authority to kind of motivate that

387
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
person to follow your directions

388
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,399
you're also going to align yourself with

389
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,279
that person

390
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
as being somebody who's similar either

391
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,639
either in belief

392
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,519
or the things that you love or the pets

393
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,240
that you have

394
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
all of those similarities that you have

395
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,760
with somebody

396
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
um could help you build rapport with

397
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,040
them very quickly

398
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
and a really wonderful example of this

399
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,240
is

400
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
uh the trick that whitney maxwell used

401
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
when she competed

402
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
and was awarded the decon black badge

403
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,279
for the scctf

404
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,040
where every caller who answered the

405
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,399
phone she said that

406
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,399
she either had the same name as that

407
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,800
person if they were

408
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,160
a woman as she is or if they were a man

409
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
she said you know my husband my brother

410
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,839
or somebody close to her

411
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,839
had the same name and she instantly

412
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
built rapport with them

413
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
this trick is great but i would

414
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,040
recommend that you do a little bit of

415
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
research if you plan to use it

416
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,040
because i did have a salesman tell me

417
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,839
that his mother had the first name elite

418
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,240
and that instantly had the opposite

419
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,839
effect because

420
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
i know there's like four elites on the

421
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
planet alive today and i know them all

422
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,160
so that completely backfired in that

423
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,279
case

424
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,120
reciprocity is another great one if you

425
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,959
give somebody information it doesn't

426
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,880
necessarily have to be a gift but if you

427
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,600
say oh

428
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
my dog's name is this the other person

429
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
is more likely to tell you their dog's

430
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,519
name

431
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,800
for example another principle is

432
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,360
scarcity so if somebody feels like

433
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
this opportunity is going to leave them

434
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,279
very quickly and they have to make an

435
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,199
immediate decision or it's going to pass

436
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,320
them by

437
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
and that can help a lot if you put that

438
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
artificial time constraint factor in

439
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,720
there

440
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,759
great great use of scarcity is if you've

441
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,959
ever watched

442
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,519
um like the home shopping network or you

443
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,440
know paid advertising on tv they're like

444
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,279
you've got a call now if you want to get

445
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:39,680
this

446
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,600
and the free one so that's that's what

447
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,199
that's really playing on

448
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,000
and then again uh consistency

449
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,959
consistency

450
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,160
is the principle that if somebody's

451
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,639
already agreed to help you or talk to

452
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
you for the first two or three things

453
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,680
that you asked them for like you've

454
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,959
already asked them what computer they

455
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,600
use

456
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,440
you've asked them what operating system

457
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,399
they use you've asked them what pdf

458
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,880
viewer they use the next question

459
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,720
they're more likely to answer

460
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
the more questions they've already

461
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,759
answered because

462
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,320
they've already displayed the fact that

463
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,199
they trust you

464
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
and now for them to object or challenge

465
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,839
you would be uncomfortable for them

466
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,279
so that's what that consistency

467
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,120
principle is referring to

468
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,000
you're going to build rapport and

469
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
confidence in the target

470
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,639
so that you can gain their trust and the

471
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,240
ability to influence them

472
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,680
you're also going to want to avoid

473
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,720
objections

474
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,839
but don't be so vague that you forget to

475
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,399
ask

476
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,440
for what you want um and a good

477
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,079
a good uh example of this is if you've

478
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,839
ever done like sales training

479
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,839
or worked in any field where you're

480
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,360
actually selling and not just

481
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
you know ringing up orders you're going

482
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,360
to have been told at some point that you

483
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,120
have to ask for the sale

484
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
and so that's really what that is you

485
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
can you can demonstrate your case you

486
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,079
can explain your pretext you can get

487
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,800
everything

488
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,920
right but if you don't actually say

489
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,319
please tell me this or what is that

490
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,679
and if you're if you're uh if your

491
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,559
attempts to

492
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,000
say something incorrect like i have your

493
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
email addresses business and this

494
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,679
and they don't actually tell you what

495
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,280
their correct email address addresses

496
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,039
and that backfired on you

497
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,480
don't be afraid to say what is your

498
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,079
correct email address if that's not the

499
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,039
right one

500
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,599
because if you don't ask for it

501
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,959
sometimes your target can just be

502
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,760
confused as to what it is that you want

503
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
and ultimately they are going to want to

504
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
get you off the phone or out of their

505
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,240
face

506
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
as quickly as possible so that they can

507
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
move on with their day so if you give

508
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,480
them

509
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,880
the directions then they are more likely

510
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,679
to comply

511
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,280
just to end the conversation and move on

512
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,960
with their lives so don't forget to ask

513
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,360
for the information

514
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
okay so now we're gonna get into the

515
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
ocean which is the exciting part

516
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,160
and i i'm gonna admit i did all this

517
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
ocean last night on my couch while i was

518
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,360
watching alias

519
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,480
so this is something that is designed

520
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
to be possible within a very short

521
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
amount of time so that you can build

522
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,679
these custom pretexts

523
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,080
and use them within your assessments and

524
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
your engagements

525
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
um you know really quickly we are

526
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,520
putting the time into learning how to do

527
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
all this stuff but the ocean portion

528
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,240
itself the

529
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
collecting of the information shouldn't

530
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,840
really take you that long

531
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,799
um so maybe an hour or two and then you

532
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,760
should be set for

533
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,799
your basic low level fishing of

534
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,440
various types so sneaky little liars

535
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,559
here we go

536
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,320
all right so an ocean overview there are

537
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,679
many different types of

538
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,559
intelligence um there are many different

539
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,760
hypotheses

540
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
and ideas about what intelligence is

541
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,840
but today we're going to be focusing on

542
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,720
mostly

543
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
sockment which is social media

544
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,720
intelligence and that's because the bulk

545
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,919
of the information that you can

546
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,039
passively collect

547
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
easily quickly and at any time of the

548
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,880
day on a target is typically on social

549
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
media of some kind

550
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,679
and that said we also want to recognize

551
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,640
that you can use any type of open source

552
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,760
intelligence

553
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,840
depending on what you find it could lead

554
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,760
you in various directions so for example

555
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
if you find on social media that they

556
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,160
are involved

557
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,880
with one specific charity or they have

558
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,760
their own

559
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,400
charity then you can actually research

560
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,280
that charity

561
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,600
and pull documents that they have to

562
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
file by law and make public record

563
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,120
where you can see where the money from

564
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,640
that charity is going

565
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
and what other things they do and that

566
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
can help you substantiate certain types

567
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
of pretext

568
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
human is human intelligence and that

569
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
would be anything that you gain from a

570
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
human

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
so if you are doing a more layered

572
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
attack you might do a couple of

573
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
vision calls or voice solicitation over

574
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
the phone to

575
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,200
extract some human to add to a more

576
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,400
complex

577
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,960
pretext

578
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,960
so this is my basic flow

579
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
for doing ocean on a business when i

580
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,559
acquire a new business target

581
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,280
start from the beginning and what i mean

582
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,559
is don't overthink it

583
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,880
go straight for the company's website

584
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,960
you can find a wealth of information and

585
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
we're going to look at each one of these

586
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,039
components

587
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,159
in a little bit more detail later on

588
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,000
but start with the website then you're

589
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
going to move on to

590
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
company review websites like glassdoor

591
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
indeed

592
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,840
um and then move into linkedin the

593
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,640
businesses official page their employees

594
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
and then go into the employees social

595
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,799
media their linkedin

596
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,960
instagram there's another pivot point

597
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,039
here for instagram that i'll get into

598
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,679
facebook the places where this business

599
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,679
is most active on social media is where

600
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,120
you want to be if they

601
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,440
you know leverage snapchat a lot in

602
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,039
their advertising that would be another

603
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,960
thing to check into

604
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
so then you you have a good idea of the

605
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
businesses culture

606
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
their employees their mission

607
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
you know you may have found various

608
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,880
photos and things that you can use the

609
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
information from to then

610
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,919
drill down into more specific

611
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,280
information and that's when you're going

612
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
to start using

613
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,080
complex google doors some of the web

614
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,799
tools

615
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,720
tools that you could find for example in

616
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,120
the trace labs vm

617
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
and other osync tools that you can use

618
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,240
to

619
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,440
to define a narrower scope

620
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,320
of information gathering and then we're

621
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,919
going to move on to compiling those

622
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,720
things

623
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
so we're looking at physical security

624
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,400
the building

625
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,559
interior exterior all those types of

626
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,799
stuff then we're looking at

627
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,679
the businesses culture um anything

628
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,600
specific to that industry

629
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
the technology that they use and then

630
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,679
their specific employees because

631
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,159
ultimately their specific employees are

632
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
probably going to give us the most

633
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,240
uh salacious information about the

634
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,200
target and

635
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,679
things that we can exploit um not

636
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,960
necessarily like

637
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,520
computer network exploit but like person

638
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
exploit

639
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,360
so where do we begin i'm gonna take a

640
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,158
quick sip of water

641
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,039
so the target that i chose for today

642
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,240
is a company that i

643
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
lovingly refer to as the death star

644
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
um i have a little bit of background

645
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,039
knowledge for this company and it's not

646
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,400
too difficult to determine

647
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
i actually used to work at att so

648
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,600
we're going to look at att's open source

649
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
everything that i'm showing you is

650
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,480
publicly on the internet

651
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
there's no paywalls no hiding and i'm

652
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
not obfuscating any of it because it is

653
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,960
out there in the wild and you can find

654
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,240
it

655
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
so the first thing i did was i went to

656
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,919
the company's website i explored

657
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,000
their leadership i looked at the

658
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
leadership's bios

659
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,120
contact information their governance

660
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,679
careers examined their job postings

661
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,039
which is where you can find a lot of

662
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,000
their technology

663
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,400
if they're requiring that a developer

664
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,679
work in a certain

665
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,600
platform it's likely that that's the

666
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
platform they use

667
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,960
um i looked at their benefits structure

668
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,120
their culture their mission statement

669
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,559
charitable giving

670
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
any notices whether it's specific to

671
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,240
something like the pandemic

672
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,000
or known outages things like that

673
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,080
those can also be helpful if you're

674
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
trying to build a pretext

675
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,240
knowing what is currently happening and

676
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
the company's website

677
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,559
is going to be the best place to find

678
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,039
those things

679
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,159
then i moved on to company review sites

680
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,200
glassdoor

681
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,240
is a wonderful thing which i absolutely

682
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,880
adore

683
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
indeed is also wonderful but don't limit

684
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,480
yourself to just

685
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,320
the most well-known of these

686
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,799
company review websites because most

687
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,679
businesses

688
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,880
have already discovered their profiles

689
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,360
and because they are so keen on managing

690
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,960
their reputations

691
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
they have become what they term as

692
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,600
engaged employers

693
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
on these platforms and they're managing

694
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,279
and responding to these reviews and

695
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,279
things like that

696
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,600
some of the lesser-known sites will

697
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,159
actually have the more salacious

698
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,919
and crazy content in the reviews

699
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,279
especially

700
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,279
because these people are not being

701
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,679
monitored and these reviews are not

702
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,640
really being

703
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,279
checked at all they're just there so

704
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,600
i've seen things from

705
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,320
affairs within offices all kinds of

706
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,240
crazy stuff so don't forget to check

707
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,279
on the other platforms and websites as

708
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,640
well

709
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,080
and don't limit yourself to just the

710
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,559
reviews the pictures that you

711
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,559
find in a lot of these

712
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,520
websites are going to have so much

713
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,640
amazing incredible valuable information

714
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,919
hidden in them uh in the background

715
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,039
to the side in a corner um

716
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,559
try not to focus on just what they want

717
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,640
you to see for example i see three

718
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,360
people

719
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,880
in really great attire this is in a in a

720
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,360
staged house so it's not anything super

721
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,960
crazy but this could be

722
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,039
a photo in an office and then you could

723
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,039
potentially see in the background

724
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,720
these are the computers they use the

725
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,159
phones they use

726
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,279
this is the layout of the office um you

727
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,440
can see things like

728
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,360
their break areas their cubicle areas

729
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,799
their meeting rooms and

730
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,640
in this top right photo this is not

731
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,480
specific to att but it's one of my

732
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,159
all-time favorite finds

733
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,799
because it has the employees badge

734
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,760
proposals from their vendors

735
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,840
business cards from the people who have

736
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
given them proposals

737
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
statements of work the computer in the

738
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,039
top right hand corner

739
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,120
the operating system the applications i

740
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,720
mean it just doesn't stop

741
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,799
and it's all one picture that an

742
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
employee posted on instagram

743
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,159
because they wanted to demonstrate that

744
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
they were super good at their job and

745
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,039
they had so much work and they're very

746
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,080
important

747
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,440
um you can also get specific employees

748
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
names out of some of the posts what

749
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,919
their job titles is what their

750
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,240
job titles are what their roles are

751
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,840
within the organization and then when

752
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,720
you call

753
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,000
they'll be like well who told you that

754
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,360
you can be like oh it's so-and-so the

755
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,559
manager of this

756
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
you know warehouse and now you look like

757
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,039
you know what's going on

758
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,200
and you can also see a lot of this

759
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,600
within

760
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,360
the photos that are posted not only by

761
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
the reviewers but by the companies

762
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,279
themselves

763
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,520
so this is a mix of those types of

764
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
photos

765
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
and you can see things like the computer

766
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,760
monitors the open desktops

767
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,679
the voice over iphones the way that

768
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,520
their cubicles look how their cubicles

769
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,480
are set up

770
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
their meeting rooms how they name their

771
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
meeting rooms

772
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
so for example if the company decided to

773
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,559
name all their meeting rooms with colors

774
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,440
that's something that you could

775
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,400
potentially use within your pretext like

776
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,760
i'm supposed to be in meeting room

777
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,919
orange right now and i'm running late

778
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
and there you go um so you're looking

779
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
for things like

780
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,600
recent events upcoming events awards

781
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,880
um physical security measures and access

782
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
controls within the building

783
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,000
badges their vendors cafeteria vendors

784
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,320
we'll come back to that later physical

785
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,360
technology

786
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,399
software dress code if you're going to

787
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:22,720
be

788
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,279
on site you want to blend in so you want

789
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,880
to dress like they do

790
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,120
and again meeting room names and the

791
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
buildings layout get a general idea and

792
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,960
a sense for how the building is laid out

793
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,159
and what you're going to be faced with

794
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,279
if you are inside of it

795
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,679
then you're going to move on to like the

796
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,120
corporately

797
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,320
created and shared brand

798
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,799
media lots of businesses right now are

799
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,559
trying to

800
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,080
attract and retain their current skills

801
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,440
and their talent

802
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,760
um they're also trying to reassure their

803
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
clients

804
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,360
in and during the pandemic that they are

805
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,399
fully capable

806
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,080
of completing their mission

807
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,000
providing the services and products that

808
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,159
they provide in a safe way

809
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
so now we're seeing a lot of businesses

810
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,840
that are sharing like day in the life

811
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,640
videos

812
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
inside the office inside employees

813
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
houses which

814
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,279
creeps me out and um you know various

815
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:19,840
places

816
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,520
all over the internet mostly in social

817
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
media you're gonna find

818
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
videos from specific employees with

819
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
their job titles departments locations

820
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,080
all that stuff is just out there and

821
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,480
this

822
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,960
is supposed to show their connection the

823
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,080
company's connection

824
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,960
to the community and demonstrate their

825
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,640
products and services

826
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,960
but it also just shares so much

827
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
information that we can find very useful

828
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,039
and beneficial to pretext

829
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,240
never discount the usefulness

830
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,440
of maps and i mean check them all

831
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,320
check google maps google earth bing maps

832
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,679
yandex mapquest

833
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,919
wherever check all the maps because

834
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,679
every single one of these

835
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,600
is going to have a different view and a

836
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
different point in time where you could

837
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,960
potentially find

838
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
the ups you know truck sitting out front

839
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,640
or

840
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,120
something else the dumpster company's

841
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
garbage truck collecting garbage

842
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
all that stuff is going to be super

843
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
beneficial

844
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
to your investigation but you have to

845
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,799
take the time

846
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,520
to review all of it so you make sure you

847
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,200
don't miss anything

848
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,760
so finally we're going to look at the

849
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,720
corporate

850
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,080
social media use their

851
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,799
brand pages to identify specific

852
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,159
employees

853
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,919
i would suggest starting with linkedin

854
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,200
again it's hit and miss

855
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,559
you know you might be dealing with a

856
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,760
sock or you might be dealing with

857
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,960
somebody who doesn't work there anymore

858
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,480
and they just haven't updated stuff

859
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,919
but you can use this to get a good feel

860
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,000
for who is a

861
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,720
over sharer and then use that person's

862
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
post to identify other people that they

863
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
work with

864
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,159
um in the case of instagram and stuff

865
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,200
like that

866
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,240
you've got the chance to say you know

867
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,799
mike isn't over sharer but bill doesn't

868
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,120
share any specifics about work but bill

869
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
comments on mike's post and says yeah

870
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,919
that was a great day at work

871
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,679
and now you can go over to bill's post

872
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,799
and even though he doesn't name the

873
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,320
company he works for

874
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
you know they work together and some of

875
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
the pictures look like they're in the

876
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,480
same place

877
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,559
so even though he's been very careful

878
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,080
not to share where he works or what his

879
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,960
job is

880
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,399
you've already determined that

881
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,080
connection exists

882
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,679
and now you can use everything that bill

883
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,840
thought he was sharing safely

884
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,200
to you know compile more insight into

885
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,279
your investigation

886
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,640
employees on social media a huge thank

887
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,679
you to all of you

888
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,000
for sharing way too much because it

889
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,120
makes my job

890
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,559
so much easier i have employees

891
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,520
sharing pictures of like the guts of

892
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,720
buildings and

893
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,320
operating operational areas systems

894
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
and stuff that should never ever be

895
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,919
shared

896
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,559
you have charities that are recognizing

897
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,559
the brand for the amazing work they do

898
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,480
and i know that sounds crappy

899
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,200
to target them based on those things but

900
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,039
this information can definitely

901
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,200
be used by malicious hackers and

902
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
attackers and bad actors

903
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
so i feel like if it's within scope it's

904
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,720
fair game right

905
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,440
and then you've got you know laptops uh

906
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,080
the bottom

907
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,679
right there that is a a t

908
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,039
retail store inventory door so

909
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,440
this could potentially be used for very

910
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,360
bad reasons by people who want to

911
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,679
break into this store and steal all the

912
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,559
devices and

913
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,720
it is something that happens more often

914
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,159
than you think

915
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,760
um so yeah that should never have been

916
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,600
posted so

917
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,360
moving along badges

918
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,320
most companies have badges of some kind

919
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,919
most companies employees

920
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
post their badges on social media

921
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,159
whether it's a new badge

922
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,440
or it's a visitor badge

923
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,919
these can all be useful and if you look

924
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,600
specifically at the visitor badge you'll

925
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,279
see that this person is supposed to be

926
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,279
escorted by a specific individual

927
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,880
that uh jg and then 2918

928
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,600
that is an employee identification

929
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,240
number

930
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,679
so every employee at att has a unique

931
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,880
identifier and their email and all of

932
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,679
their

933
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,000
accounts within att are tied to that

934
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,960
number

935
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,279
um so that's something that also should

936
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,960
not be on social media

937
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
um but now you could you know construct

938
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
yourself a little visitor badge

939
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,039
and potentially get on site oh yeah i

940
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,159
lost my escort because i went to the

941
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,760
restroom or something like that

942
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,279
um you also have a valid for many years

943
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,240
from now

944
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,840
employee badge that you could

945
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
potentially copy and

946
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,720
create for yourself and then in this

947
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,600
next picture

948
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
i'm going to give you a couple seconds

949
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,840
to figure out the thing that i saw

950
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,960
we're looking at a jabra webcam they're

951
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,120
very excited about having a new camera

952
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,960
but what do you see in this picture

953
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,279
regarding software specifically

954
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,919
if you said webex good job because now

955
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,399
we know

956
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,480
this company probably uses webex for a

957
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,399
lot of their internal communications

958
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,559
and important meetings and things like

959
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,760
that so

960
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,000
all of these things can be slightly

961
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,200
hidden and people think they're not a

962
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,240
big deal but

963
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,519
now i could use this in an email fish

964
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,640
and pose as webex trying to

965
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,200
get them to click on something or

966
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,840
complete a form or do something like

967
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
that

968
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,519
this example i love target vendors

969
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,200
because i've worked so much

970
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,240
in the corporate side of big american

971
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
businesses

972
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,399
i am very familiar comforter comfortable

973
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,919
and confident

974
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,039
talking to people as a vendor or as

975
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,039
a another corporate employee at another

976
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,480
company um

977
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,559
and and kind of trying to to gain that

978
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
rapport and that trust that way

979
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,720
so for this specific example i found a

980
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,079
photo that was geo

981
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,800
tagged as being within the att

982
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,399
headquarters in dallas

983
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,440
and i checked and this cafe 208

984
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,320
i wanted to know is this actually inside

985
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,239
of that building and sure enough

986
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,839
they were super helpful by putting in

987
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,480
their bio that they are serving fresh

988
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,199
flavorful and unique dishes to the at t

989
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,159
headquarters

990
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,960
every day and they also do catering and

991
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,320
there is their yahoo email address

992
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,918
that's tremendous like that is awesome

993
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,760
because now i can either use that for

994
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,960
voice solicitation

995
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,119
or an email fish like hey we're doing uh

996
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,040
um we're doing an event we're catering

997
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,839
it what meal options would you prefer

998
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,280
there's perfect fish and uh now i also

999
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,239
have a picture

1000
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,240
that i found from that cafe's

1001
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,480
feed just scrolling on through there

1002
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,599
last night

1003
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,040
where it shows the cafe employees have a

1004
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,520
different

1005
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
and unique type of badge that they have

1006
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,440
as employees

1007
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,599
and i could potentially make one of

1008
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,599
those and say that i was you know a

1009
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,480
supervisor

1010
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,839
or somebody coming on site to do

1011
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,760
training for the staff

1012
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,640
of this cafe and because the badge is

1013
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,240
different from the att

1014
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,920
employees badge they'll be less familiar

1015
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,119
with it and i could use that fact

1016
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,400
to where you know if my badge isn't

1017
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,520
perfect they're probably not going to be

1018
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,800
able to tell because they haven't paid

1019
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
that close attention to it whereas if i

1020
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,400
tried to make an att badge and i do it

1021
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,119
wrong

1022
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,640
they would be more likely to be able to

1023
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,680
challenge me another another tactic is

1024
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,240
just to

1025
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
flip a badge around backwards and wear

1026
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,440
it so that the

1027
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,839
back is facing out and most people will

1028
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,800
not challenge you

1029
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,599
so that's another way to go so now that

1030
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,280
we've compiled our ocean

1031
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,839
we are going to move into the

1032
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,480
um compile phase and we're going to put

1033
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
together perfect little pretexts

1034
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,160
and the way that we do that is we take

1035
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,520
all of the knowledge and the

1036
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,119
intelligence

1037
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,000
that we've managed to gain and that

1038
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,079
intelligence is going to inform

1039
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,280
our pretext so we're using the

1040
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
information we found to create the

1041
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,480
pretext

1042
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
rather than coming up with an awesome

1043
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,160
idea for a pretext and then trying to

1044
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
find the information to substantiate

1045
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,200
that that's much more difficult

1046
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
and sometimes it doesn't really work out

1047
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,400
that well so

1048
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,640
for this example and for my general um

1049
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,000
my general process i always do the ocean

1050
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,480
first

1051
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,800
and then figure out what pretext i can

1052
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,599
create

1053
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,880
from that intelligence

1054
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,960
so compile we're going to take stock of

1055
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,800
the information that we gained

1056
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,720
we're going to determine what options we

1057
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,800
have for pretexts

1058
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
then we're going to make a decision pick

1059
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,560
a pretext and then create

1060
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,839
that pretext

1061
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,599
so there's a lot of things that goes

1062
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,000
into that on the back end and you can

1063
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,839
make these decisions more quickly as you

1064
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,480
become more familiar with how to do this

1065
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,400
so are you going to be an internal

1066
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
employee or external

1067
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,320
are you going to use an authority-based

1068
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,040
pretext

1069
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,960
or try to feign ignorance or

1070
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,119
lack of preparedness and go for empathy

1071
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,720
instead

1072
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,640
you'll need to align your biases with

1073
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,040
the company culture with the general

1074
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,480
uh you know employee stereotypical

1075
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,720
priorities and all that good stuff also

1076
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,480
make sure that you're conscious of the

1077
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,240
location of the business so that you can

1078
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,320
kind of assimilate that way through

1079
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,640
emulating their culture their jargon

1080
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,839
keywords

1081
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,119
um geographically specific words

1082
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,200
like the difference between soda and pop

1083
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,320
for example

1084
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,440
in various parts of the united states

1085
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,839
you're going to pick a theme for your

1086
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,520
pretext decide how you're going to build

1087
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,640
rapport

1088
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,560
link some of the ideas together if

1089
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,240
you're trying to get multiple flags for

1090
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,480
example so that you can capitalize

1091
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,560
um and just go for the jugular and get

1092
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,400
as many flags as possible out of one

1093
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,280
kind of little

1094
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
thread of the conversation memorize

1095
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,240
the information that you are trying to

1096
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,920
get um if you are

1097
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,960
for example doing a contest or

1098
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,599
you have specific flags of information

1099
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,320
that you're getting

1100
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
for the client have those somewhere in

1101
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,720
front of you or memorize them so that

1102
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,119
an opportunity comes up where you might

1103
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,640
be able to elicit that information

1104
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,839
you'll be able to

1105
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,640
easily segue into that through natural

1106
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,520
conversation

1107
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,920
bring them back in if things get off

1108
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,000
track and just be prepared to kind of

1109
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,040
segue

1110
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,160
one way or pivot and bring them back if

1111
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,760
things start to go off track you need to

1112
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,160
maintain control of the conversation

1113
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,599
so you collect the ocean that you

1114
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,200
gathered and

1115
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
you're going to group it by type who are

1116
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,800
they

1117
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,320
the people that you are planning to

1118
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,960
target what do you need

1119
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,520
to substantiate your pretext from the

1120
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,560
information that you

1121
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,480
have and that's going to determine who

1122
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,560
you are now if you decide that you're

1123
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,359
going to be a vendor

1124
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,040
you need to go back and do this ocean

1125
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,200
process for the vendor from start to

1126
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,760
finish

1127
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,800
company website glassdoor and go through

1128
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,839
the whole thing

1129
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,599
because you want to be able to speak to

1130
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,200
the fact that you're an employee

1131
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,960
like you actually are and that's the

1132
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,800
best way for you to do that

1133
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,280
so what i did um specifically for the

1134
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,839
scctf was i made myself a four square

1135
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,800
and it was just a sheet of paper with a

1136
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,680
you know

1137
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,160
four quadrants this was the only thing

1138
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,800
that i took

1139
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,880
with me into the booth aside from my

1140
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
list of numbers that i was going to call

1141
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,079
and what number i was spoofing i had who

1142
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:36,880
i am

1143
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,119
what's my name what's my email address

1144
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,000
all that stuff

1145
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,359
okay then i had who are

1146
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,880
the targets and one sheet for each uh

1147
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,520
pretext who's the target what are their

1148
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,560
contact details

1149
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,400
who are they why am i calling them and

1150
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,640
then some details about the pretext

1151
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,599
um and you know the the main things that

1152
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,280
i need to keep in mind i'm calling from

1153
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,640
this place i'm

1154
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
calling because of this and then to the

1155
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,720
right of that what are the points i need

1156
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,880
to hit what flags do i need to get

1157
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,720
um what actions do i need to get them to

1158
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,160
take and then

1159
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,760
if i needed it i had a couple sheets of

1160
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,359
paper that were like how to find

1161
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,040
the version of this particular

1162
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,560
application etc

1163
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,839
and that's all i took with me was just

1164
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,760
hard copy piece of paper

1165
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,800
and a pencil so here

1166
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,839
is a great example of an email fish

1167
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,359
pretext

1168
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,119
this is one that i did very recently and

1169
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,480
it was actually deployed

1170
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,520
and used successfully so

1171
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,359
we determined that the company was

1172
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,040
having a 5k all these people had

1173
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,240
registered for the 5k

1174
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,760
it was within scope to contact the

1175
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,480
people that have registered for the 5k

1176
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,839
um for this charity event for the

1177
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,240
company so what we decided was

1178
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,440
instead of asking them to like

1179
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,280
re-register or

1180
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
you know do some other company related

1181
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,119
something or other that really doesn't

1182
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,640
you know it doesn't hold importance to

1183
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,240
them it doesn't really incentivize them

1184
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,440
there's no

1185
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,800
um artificial time constraint or

1186
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,520
pressure

1187
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
or anything to elicit an emotional

1188
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,119
reaction if i say this is just another

1189
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,800
administrative thing you have to do

1190
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,640
to do this race you're not likely to get

1191
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
a good click-through rate

1192
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,160
so what we did instead was we decided to

1193
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,800
pose

1194
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,760
as the t-shirt vendor for the run so if

1195
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
the runs being put on by the company

1196
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,119
this is the company that's making their

1197
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,800
free 5k

1198
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
t-shirt for everybody who completes the

1199
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,359
5k or or at least attempts the 5k

1200
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,960
so we contacted all the registered

1201
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,240
participants and we asked them to

1202
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,599
complete a form

1203
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,359
with their size because we wanted to

1204
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,680
make sure that we had enough t-shirts in

1205
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,200
each size for everyone so

1206
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,720
because people are like ah i really want

1207
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,480
my free t-shirt i want to make sure they

1208
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,839
have my size

1209
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,280
that is going to just kind of like

1210
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,920
hijack their brain and tell them to make

1211
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,040
this emotional

1212
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
decision so they don't miss out on the

1213
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,960
opportunity to have a t-shirt

1214
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,640
and so then we sent them to a forum and

1215
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,839
they completed all the information we

1216
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,280
wanted but first we captured their

1217
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,880
credentials

1218
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,839
so that's a fun pretext that that kind

1219
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,720
of makes use of

1220
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,000
everything that we've already talked

1221
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,119
about and it was through the ocean about

1222
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,599
this 5k that's all over social media

1223
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,119
that we were able to determine that that

1224
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,040
was the best route

1225
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,920
for us to use

1226
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,599
then another pretext is the

1227
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,040
cafeteria one this is one of my

1228
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,480
favorites and we already looked at the

1229
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,359
cafeteria information so now we know

1230
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,040
there's a separate third party that is

1231
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,040
the cafe or cafeteria vendor for

1232
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,440
the target company headquarters and this

1233
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,119
is common within a lot of headquarters

1234
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,599
of a lot of big companies around

1235
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,520
the united states for example

1236
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,319
your your cafeteria vendor is a separate

1237
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,839
company so it kind of makes it

1238
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,319
easier to use the separation of the two

1239
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,920
companies to gain

1240
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,119
access or to gain information in the

1241
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,240
context of a

1242
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,160
phone fish or a wishing exercise

1243
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,119
where you're calling the target company

1244
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,720
to gain information

1245
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,920
so specific to this pretext we were

1246
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,040
going to call

1247
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,160
the target company and try to figure out

1248
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,440
what types of technology and their

1249
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,560
security

1250
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
process that they have physically on

1251
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,839
site um

1252
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,079
and then also get some information about

1253
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,920
whether they're i.t departments on site

1254
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,680
and some other things

1255
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,640
about their technology that they use at

1256
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,079
the corporate headquarters

1257
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,599
so the way that we did this is we

1258
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,760
compiled as much information as we could

1259
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,280
about the target company and we

1260
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
gained as much information as we could

1261
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,000
from the physical pictures of inside and

1262
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,040
then we called

1263
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,560
and talked to um somebody on site just

1264
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,040
saying

1265
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,480
hey i've been trying to get a hold of

1266
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,200
somebody within the cafeteria vendor

1267
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,960
company that i work for but i've just

1268
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,240
been stuck in your ivr

1269
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,400
for like two days trying to get a hold

1270
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,720
of the actual cafe i can't reach them

1271
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,240
um do you have a couple minutes just to

1272
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
answer a couple quick questions

1273
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,920
so answer my questions and i'll get out

1274
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,359
of your life real quick

1275
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,400
um and usually people are like sure and

1276
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,000
then you ask them the easy stuff

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,200
like hey do you have like do am i gonna

1278
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,800
have to get a badge when i come in like

1279
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,400
what door do i use

1280
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,119
um what kind of badges are they do i

1281
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,040
need to bring anything specific

1282
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,000
do you have an id department on on site

1283
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,520
is there gonna be a way for me to

1284
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,760
connect my laptop to a projector do i

1285
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,680
need to bring a projector

1286
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,160
um that kind of stuff and then through

1287
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,720
that

1288
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,400
like i'm so unprepared but i want to be

1289
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,839
prepared when i come train

1290
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,079
the employees of this cafeteria you

1291
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,599
manage to elicit quite a bit of

1292
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,480
information

1293
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
from that target and they're none the

1294
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
wiser um

1295
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,680
and that's also very important to me

1296
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,359
you'll notice that none of my pretexts

1297
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,240
are based in

1298
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,440
fear or um you know coercion

1299
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,359
i don't terrify people i don't make

1300
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,800
people feel bad

1301
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
um people need to understand that they

1302
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,800
can have just a very bland

1303
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,119
normal natural sounding conversation and

1304
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,880
still give away a lot of

1305
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,079
sensitive information or at least um

1306
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,160
you know the more innocuous information

1307
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,680
points that i could use

1308
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,520
to then elicit more sensitive

1309
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,560
information later on

1310
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,480
and finally we're going to talk about

1311
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:16,800
the

1312
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,280
sample pretext for charities and this

1313
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,119
one again this is a phone

1314
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,960
fish or a wishing exercise i posed as

1315
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,480
the representative of an

1316
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,720
of a charity that had done work with

1317
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,400
this target organization

1318
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,000
before and that target charity

1319
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,960
um the charity that i was posing as not

1320
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,200
the target but the target company

1321
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,400
had very very vocally shared

1322
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,960
their engagement with this charity um

1323
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,160
there were press releases with the

1324
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,240
actual dollar amount that was donated

1325
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,760
and so i called and i said that i was

1326
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,560
trying to recognize the target company

1327
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,880
being a representative of the charity

1328
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,240
and through the work that they did with

1329
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,000
the most recent campaign that raised x

1330
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,200
amount of dollars

1331
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,760
we wanted to create an award for them

1332
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,280
but we needed them to complete

1333
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,480
a pdf form and i said

1334
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,920
that i had sent the form the week

1335
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,680
earlier and asked if they'd received it

1336
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,280
i never sent the form they of course did

1337
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,359
not receive it so when she said

1338
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,280
no i didn't get it she immediately felt

1339
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,640
like she was indebted to me like she

1340
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,960
owed me to make sure that that got done

1341
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,520
and so from there i was able to gain

1342
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,040
some flags around

1343
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,319
what type of email mail client that

1344
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,960
they were using um confirm the pdf

1345
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,160
viewer that they were using in the

1346
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,000
version to make sure that she could open

1347
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,680
this pdf form that i was about to send

1348
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,319
her

1349
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,480
i also got her to confirm her correct

1350
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,839
email address

1351
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,000
and a number of different data points

1352
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,040
about

1353
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,880
her computer and the software that they

1354
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
used and i got her buy-in

1355
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,400
her commitment that as soon as i sent

1356
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,720
that email she would open that pdf and

1357
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,680
complete it

1358
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,960
without really thinking it through

1359
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,040
because she's already met me

1360
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,680
we built rapport she trusts me and now

1361
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,040
she feels indebted to me because she

1362
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,640
feels like she's let me down

1363
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,599
i know all of these things are terrible

1364
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,400
um

1365
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
when i play them out like that it sounds

1366
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,520
really horrible

1367
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,640
but i would much rather focus on the

1368
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,760
aspects of allowing people to make these

1369
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,960
mistakes

1370
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,880
in the context of an engagement where

1371
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,040
they do have the ability

1372
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,599
to learn from them and where there's no

1373
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:20,800
real damage

1374
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,400
rather than having somebody make a

1375
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,559
mistake like this in the context of an

1376
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,280
actual fishing engagement um or an

1377
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,720
actual malicious

1378
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,359
attack um and i've been subjected to a

1379
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,200
number of them even within the past week

1380
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,440
i mean the office 365 credential

1381
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,200
fishing on linkedin is getting out of

1382
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
control so these are the three pretexts

1383
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,079
that i have to share with you today

1384
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,559
um and that was my process for how i

1385
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,760
gather the information

1386
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,119
compile a pretext and then leverage that

1387
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,200
against the target organization through

1388
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,160
the course of my

1389
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,200
engagements with business clients and so

1390
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,880
i'm going to wrap it up right there i

1391
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,480
think i have about a minute so i will

1392
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,240
say thank you again

thank you so much elite that was that

1410
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
was amazing i

1411
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,680
i was trying to keep up with the

1412
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,839
comments so that i could um ask you some

1413
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,280
questions from the chat

1414
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,000
people are super excited about what you

1415
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,640
put on there

1416
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,160
i love that every time i watch one of

1417
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,920
your presentations i just feel like

1418
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,760
i could totally do something like this

1419
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,000
yeah you make it seem so possible even

1420
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,359
though it's backed up by just

1421
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,400
tons of experience yeah it is something

1422
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
that is very accessible and i will share

1423
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:56,960
that

1424
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,800
um i think it was like three or four

1425
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,400
years ago somebody was like oh yeah all

1426
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,160
kids are red teamers and i was like what

1427
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,599
is a red teamer

1428
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,720
so it is 100 something that is very

1429
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,240
accessible that you can learn

1430
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,800
it does take time and um getting the

1431
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,079
experience through doing

1432
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,520
capture the flag contests and things

1433
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,359
like that really helped

1434
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,839
awesome um i did see one question come

1435
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,000
through as i'm scrolling back here

1436
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,359
um if you give me just one second here

1437
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,680
about how you deal with refusals uh if

1438
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,880
you have any

1439
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,680
kind of tips or techniques so objections

1440
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,880
can be horrible

1441
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,760
um usually i'll fall back on feigning

1442
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,119
ignorance if it's not something that i'm

1443
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,119
super confident to speak to

1444
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,280
um there was one time i asked to target

1445
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,160
the same question

1446
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,839
twice in the same conversation i'd done

1447
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,599
a ton of vision calls that day and i was

1448
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,680
like mixing up who had asked what

1449
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,800
and so i asked her again to confirm like

1450
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,359
a

1451
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,200
browser that she used or something and

1452
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,559
she said what and i said oh

1453
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,200
gosh i'm so sorry i'm sorry i just i'm

1454
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,800
working from home today with a sick

1455
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,359
child and i'm a little flustered and she

1456
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,440
immediately dropped all suspicions so

1457
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,559
there are some times that you can kind

1458
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,440
of play them

1459
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,760
and like wiggle your way out of it um

1460
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,200
but also having the

1461
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
the technical expertise or the knowledge

1462
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,480
about the certain thing that you're

1463
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,359
after

1464
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,839
and being able to to come back from a

1465
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,680
position of confidence and not

1466
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,880
cockiness or with attitude try to avoid

1467
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,200
that

1468
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,440
but you can generally overcome those

1469
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,839
objections

1470
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,720
