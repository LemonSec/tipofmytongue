107
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,760
couple of social handles where you can

108
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879
reach out to me from um i just wanted to

109
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,319
start by showing you

110
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,519
uh this image so um for me i

111
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,360
i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this

112
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
community um

113
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,879
which is a nursing community and this

114
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
this image is probably the best way to

115
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,239
really encapsulate that

116
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,319
um it's from a from a twitter account

117
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,599
called social links

118
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
of people that have used the osen

119
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,080
hashtag um over the past year

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,599
and it's all of these people that have

121
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
given me opportunities

122
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
that have provided this research that

123
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
have helped me learn

124
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,720
and have also brought in other people as

125
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
well to work and volunteer for groups

126
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,799
like ncptf

127
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,799
um so the national child protection task

128
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
force also the amazing hackathons with

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
trace labs which

130
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
are fun but equally as serious and

131
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
important because that's about such a

132
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
such a big issue of missing persons

133
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,839
which often lead into

134
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680
really serious serious cases and

135
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,199
investigations so

136
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,800
i wanted to sort of share this with you

137
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,280
to show you that there is a community of

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
people here

139
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,639
um and a lot of these people are really

140
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,520
friendly

141
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,240
uh you know i've i've again as i said um

142
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
i wouldn't have you know got to where i

143
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,240
was

144
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
if it wasn't for that so if anyone's

145
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
looking to start out

146
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
or to volunteer with these groups or

147
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
anything like that get involved in the

148
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
community this is what you know this

149
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,919
sort of open source intelligence is

150
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,720

172
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
time and a bit of full time as well

173
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
so there's a picture of me on the left

174
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,520
on a job i used to do

175
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
in the army um i can't do that anymore

176
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,720
because

177
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,919
obviously i kind of have an internet

178
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,000
connection and a laptop there um

179
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
but again it just shows the sort of

180
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
polarization of people with different

181
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
backgrounds coming in

182
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,039
and being welcomed by this really cool

183
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,479
community

184
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,440
um so before i get started i just wanted

185
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,960
to show a little bit of a disclaimer so

186
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,639
obviously we're on twitch as well so i

187
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
can't show anything too

188
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,880
too terrible but there are some

189
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
distressing things and distressing

190
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,360
content

191
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080
in this slide deck as well the

192
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,360
information on these slides is for

193
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,880
research purposes

194
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,600
and any information that is uh in these

195
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,039
case studies

196
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
i don't endorse the political views of

197
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
them or anything like that

198
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
it's meant to be for research purposes

199
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
only so that you can take it

200
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
you can critique it you can build upon

201
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
your own investigations and your

202
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
your research methodologies and you can

203
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,280
also

204
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,800
you know come back to me and we can have

205
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
fruitful conversations about

206
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
how better to do things and best

207
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
practices and things like that so

208
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,360
this is why i'm sharing these case

209
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,039
studies and i'm really trying to

210
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
encourage other people to do this thing

211
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
um so the theme of my presentation today

212
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,759
is about location finding

213
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,319
uh it's something i'm really keen on

214
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
it's something that i obsess about it's

215
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,039
my hobby

216
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,039
um so i'm gonna give a little bit of an

217
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,160
overview as to

218
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,039
location finding but i'm also going to

219
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,319
go through

220
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
common cases in location finding or

221
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,919
geolocation

222
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,400
so how to do it indoors and outdoors and

223
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,919
how to look at objects and where they

224
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,280
come from

225
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,479
a lot of these things are quite

226
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
important in in some of the

227
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
some of the work so for instance i do

228
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
volunteer with the national child

229
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
protection task force

230
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,280
uh not as much as i'd like to um but

231
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
when i do get my free time it's it's

232
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,400
it's good to be able to do that because

233
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,120
it's such

234
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
a great important cause and a lot of

235
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,960
these sorts of things

236
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,120
are the things we're doing over and over

237
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
again on different cases

238
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,919
and just the same as the um

239
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,840
as this sort of research method for the

240
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
trace labs groups as well

241
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
so i just wanted to cover some of these

242
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
methodologies

243
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
um and then in the third section i'm

244
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,840
going to go through

245
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
why this is useful so to how to pivot

246
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,160
once you get that information so it's

247
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
not just about finding a cool image and

248
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,440
putting it on twitter and saying hey i

249
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
geolocated this

250
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
but how to move on from that and how to

251
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
pivot on that information which

252
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
at the end of the day separates us from

253
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
computers is being able to pivot

254
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
and being creative with the information

255
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,800
we can get

256
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
online and drawing results from that so

257
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
i'm going to go through a few of those

258
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,639
but first of all for those of you that

259
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,319
don't know about geolocation

260
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,400
i'm going to go through a very simple

261
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
introduction to it

262
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
so here's a selfie from someone uh

263
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,840
in a place and and essentially what

264
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
we're going to do is go through

265
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
how we find exactly where he took that

266
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
photo from

267
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
now many of you are probably saying i

268
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
know already you know this must be

269
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
i can see the buildings in the

270
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
background we must be able to recognize

271
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,319
these already

272
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
okay cool so the methodology i want to

273
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,719
sort of talk about over this entire

274
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
series and and presentation is about

275
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,519
what you can do with these sorts of

276
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,159
images so we have a look at the context

277
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
how is that uploaded what was the text

278
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,839
that came with it who sent it to you and

279
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,880
where are they from

280
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
these sorts of things is context what's

281
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
in the foreground

282
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
what's in the background are there any

283
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
map markings so is there a lake

284
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,160
is there a river is there a mountain

285
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,839
something that will stick out on

286
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,640
a map and then the last part and the

287
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,519
most important part

288
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
trial and error you know this is what a

289
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,560
computer cannot do

290
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
we cannot make a computer be creative

291
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,080
they can analyze

292
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
things and flag them for you in the

293
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
background and foreground and

294
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
map markings and things like that but

295
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
humans can be creative and this is where

296
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
trial and error comes in and this is why

297
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
i want to share these case studies

298
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
so having a look at this picture again

299
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,720
analyzing the image

300
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
what do we look for so there's some

301
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
obvious signs um

302
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
over on the the right we have a sort of

303
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,080
tall

304
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
slender odd looking building we've got a

305
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,120
river

306
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,959
on the right as well with the bridge

307
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,040
going over it then we have this

308
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,600
walkie-talkie-shaped building

309
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,880
and then we've got this one which

310
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
everyone's probably like oh cool that's

311
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,120
the egg

312
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
so if you've ever seen um any sort of

313
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,279
mission impossible film that's

314
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,959
in london you would have seen that as

315
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
well as a lot of other popular films

316
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
um so immediately we know okay that's

317
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
london we can go to google maps

318
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
now we start to look at objects here to

319
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
get down into the detail

320
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
so we need to put on the satellite view

321
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,680
for google maps

322
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
and then we can start to zoom in a bit

323
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
more and what i've done here is i've

324
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,279
tilted my google maps

325
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,279
so that we have a 3d view of london city

326
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,680
and most cities do have a 3d view

327
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,839
um most western cities anyway but some

328
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,360
of the developing areas are also getting

329
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
that which is pretty cool because

330
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,600
there's some

331
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
beautiful architecture in those areas

332
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,519
anyway so what we can start to do is

333
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
match up this skyline to the one that we

334
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,480
saw before

335
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
and what we see in that skyline we have

336
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,519
buildings that match

337
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,760
great got a good location but we can

338
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,399
drill down further into the detail

339
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,600
so we have in the distance the bigger

340
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,480
buildings

341
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
we have the river the the the thames

342
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,720
river there as well

343
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,320
and we have this little park right in

344
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,519
front of this building so we can work

345
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,279
our way backwards and see where he took

346
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,120
this photo from

347
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,519
now we know that it was this sort of

348
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
rounded shape so we can see okay well

349
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
it's probably saint paul's cathedral

350
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
what i've done here is i've just brought

351
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,519
up all of the available imagery

352
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,760
around st paul's cathedral again this is

353
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
only using google maps

354
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
so this is street view the little blue

355
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
circles are usually

356
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
360 degree photos and so we can use a

357
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
lot of these to sort of

358
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
you know try and see exactly if we can

359
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
replicate the same image we're looking

360
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
at

361
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
and by having a look around st paul's

362
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
cathedral we can see that there's a

363
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,959
there's a photo that's been taken or

364
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,240
plenty of photos that have been taken

365
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,519
from up there as well

366
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
um and specifically this one we can see

367
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,040
the rounding of that edge we can see the

368
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,079
buildings

369
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,839
and we can see that he took that photo

370
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,760
from there then it's just a like a

371
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
really small

372
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
introduction and easy to understand

373
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
introduction as to how to do

374
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,600
um a little bit of geolocation so now

375
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
i'm going to go through some common

376
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,760
cases

377
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,480
that we have in geolocation so the first

378
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,880
one

379
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
is geolocating things outdoors and this

380
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
is a case study from libya

381
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
that i worked on last year so

382
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
specifically

383
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
we have a helicopter

384
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
flying over the water

385
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,680
if we go through a little bit more in

386
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
this clip

387
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,440
we'll start to see that he just randomly

388
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,160
fires

389
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,279
lots of rockets out of the helicopter um

390
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
now i do a lot of conflict mapping and a

391
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
lot of conflict watching as well

392
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,760
um and it's always good to find a

393
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
location for these sorts of things you

394
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
can find where they're coming from

395
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
um and really identify you know

396
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
movements on a map and this is just

397
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,079
using publicly available information

398
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,720
and a little bit of analysis um i also

399
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,079
wanted to know where these rockets were

400
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,040
firing because this

401
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,560
is quite strange just to be firing

402
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,360
rockets in a random direction

403
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,519
so what i do is i always go through a

404
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
process when we have videos

405
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
i make something called a panorama

406
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,639
there's no

407
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,800
special intelligence software that i use

408
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,839
for this

409
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
i use preview on mac you can also do

410
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,519
this in

411
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
photo photoshop or microsoft paint as

412
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
well

413
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
basically i take a screenshot of the

414
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,839
video and

415
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,399
i build a free or a full view panorama

416
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
so now we can start geolocating because

417
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
we have a wide image with lots of

418
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,360
features

419
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,079
like for instance um the features we

420
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,399
have

421
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,560
are like the little coastline here with

422
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,800
the dark sort of patches

423
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,480
we've got this straight line up here

424
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,880
that looks like a railway line or some

425
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,920
sort of straight line

426
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,240
and we have a few like patches in in the

427
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,079
earth as well that we could maybe match

428
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:22,800
up and

429
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
i think this coastline is probably a

430
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
dead giveaway as well it's sort of like

431
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,320
a snakey cosine too

432
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,680
um so again i can replicate what that

433
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,079
guy was doing just by flying around on

434
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,279
google earth

435
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,560
and pretending that i'm in that

436
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
helicopter and trying to find that same

437
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,959
sort of coastline as well

438
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
so i flew around google earth for about

439
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,240
an hour up the

440
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,720
libyan coast and i found this coastline

441
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,680
here

442
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,120
and it's quite useful as coastline

443
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,279
because it's it matches

444
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,600
a few of the features that we had in in

445
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
that photo as well that we saw

446
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,839
so we can sort of see that snaking along

447
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
and it's also got those dark patches as

448
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
well

449
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
and we can also match up the line over

450
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
here and the patches in the soil

451
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,079
cool so we have a location but i always

452
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
like to dive down

453
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
into the detail just to change it from

454
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,399
99 to 100

455
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,720
sure that the helicopter flew over this

456
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,079
patch of land

457
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,800
um there's always fingerprints in photos

458
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,240
that i like to identify

459
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
fingerprints are something unique that

460
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
can really only be matched

461
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
to a satellite image in an and a photo

462
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,079
or

463
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,880
a video screenshot as well and so

464
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,800
something i found was like these little

465
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,360
bushes

466
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,760
that are down here um so that was the

467
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,279
fingerprint that i was able to use

468
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
between a satellite image on google maps

469
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,320
or google earth

470
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
and a uh the video the screenshot of the

471
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
of the photo

472
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
of the video um of this uh helicopter

473
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,079
flying over

474
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,519
and that was an exact match that

475
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,680
fingerprint of the curvature of the

476
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,040
um coastline as well as the the bushes

477
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,000
there so that was quite

478
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
useful and then i was able to have a

479
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,639
look at other things like where that

480
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,160
helicopter would have come from

481
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
the direction it was firing at and

482
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,279
things like that um

483
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,920
so another case study from libya uh was

484
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,560
one

485
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
where i was looking at geolocating

486
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,000
something indoors

487
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
um so this was posted on twitter by a

488
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
an analyst i think for a private

489
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
intelligence firm

490
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
but wanted to know the location of where

491
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
these guys were

492
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
i wanted to have a look at that too so i

493
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,639
found this a bit of a challenge

494
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
uh so having a look at one of the photos

495
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
here it was this photo that gave me sort

496
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,920
of some

497
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
real interesting clues um so that's the

498
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,240
photo and it's full when we open up the

499
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,199
tweet

500
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,800
and obviously this is really difficult

501
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,240
you know what would this look like on a

502
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,759
map it's quite hard because we're inside

503
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,399
a building

504
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,480
but when you're inside you can

505
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,920
understand the structure of how a

506
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
building would look like on the outside

507
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,480
so this is a type of warehouse we can

508
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,079
see it has different peaks and angles

509
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,360
and things like that and its specific

510
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
shape

511
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
what we can also see is patches and

512
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,839
identification marks

513
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,759
so for instance this one on the car door

514
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
here is a unique patch

515
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,240
that seems to only be related to this

516
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,320
group

517
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,839
which is quite common in libya to have

518
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,880
these sort of factionalized patches

519
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,800
so i had a look through this one um this

520
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,279
is on yandex image reverse search

521
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,600
on yantex we have an option to select a

522
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
crop area or to crop an area

523
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,120
and and then basis search off that so i

524
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,360
did that for this patched on the card

525
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,240
door here

526
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,839
and i was able to run a search to

527
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,519
effectively lead myself

528
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,560
to a facebook page which gave me info

529
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,519
about this group

530
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,240
and led me to benghazi now that's kind

531
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,360
of cool but

532
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
where on earth is that building how am i

533
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
supposed to find this

534
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800
so it took me about two to three hours

535
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,959
to have a look around benghazi

536
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
but what was i looking for okay well as

537
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
i said before

538
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
we know what the building looks like on

539
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,519
the outside because we can see the

540
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,600
structure of it on the inside

541
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,880
so we have like this straight part here

542
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
we have a little hole up in the roof

543
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,560
here as well that could be a little

544
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
fingerprint that we're looking for in

545
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
visual forensics

546
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,720
so i created a little model of how that

547
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,359
might look

548
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,959
on a map or to a bird and

549
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599
and making my way around benghazi

550
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,679
eventually i was able to find this

551
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,880
factory

552
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,959
and it matches the exact sort of makeup

553
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,319
of what i

554
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
modeled the inside of that building to

555
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
look like which is quite useful

556
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
after that i was able to find more

557
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
information about this group

558
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,799
able to find that they are a special

559
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,799
forces group as well and

560
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,520
you know further conduct an analysis on

561
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,080
that

562
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
so that was quite interesting um on the

563
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,840
subject of patches

564
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,240
this is one that um i'd like to share

565
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,039
with you about

566
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,160
objects in australia that led me to

567
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
australia

568
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,039
so this is a really amazing project by

569
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,840
europol

570
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,160
on the stop child abuse trace and object

571
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,200
program

572
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
essentially these are screenshots or

573
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,520
images related to

574
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,240
investigations to stop child abuse

575
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
europol puts this out to the public and

576
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,840
they crowdsource this which really goes

577
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
to show the power of community and

578
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,640
crowdsourcing

579
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
there's been a lot of amazing results

580
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,520
come out of this sort of project

581
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
so one of the pictures that i looked at

582
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,799
was um

583
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,000
this football jersey um and

584
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
there's a couple of clues in it so we've

585
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
got like a logo at the top right here

586
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,919
this star

587
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,919
and we have a logo on the left like a

588
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,360
like a football logo you're probably

589
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,720
already guessing like must be some sort

590
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
of sport theme or something like that

591
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,919
i was too um i tried an image reverse

592
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:34,480
search

593
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,360
on this logo could not find anything

594
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,480
whatsoever

595
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,600
what i did was i went into preview again

596
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,919
on mac but you can also do this in

597
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
photoshop and i recreated the logo to

598
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,880
try reverse

599
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
search on that so i did that

600
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
in um in google image reverse search

601
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
and i got this image down here on the

602
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,919
left

603
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,720
uh which is a pretty good match to the

604
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,000
one that we actually had

605
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,600
on that jersey there so nfl okay

606
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,039
let's go a little bit further from that

607
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,880
we've made a great finding how can we go

608
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,320
a little bit further

609
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,160
so nfl is the northern football league

610
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
which is is an entire league so there's

611
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
obviously sub groups and sub teams

612
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,559
i wanted to know a little bit more so i

613
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,440
went to a database site called academic

614
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,760
um it lists a lot of the teams that are

615
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
there and has their

616
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
representative jerseys or sweaters or

617
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
shirts that they wear while playing

618
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,000
football so

619
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,120
the design for this one was for

620
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,320
and we can see here was the laylor stars

621
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,679
junior football club

622
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,840
okay what a great lead and that was a

623
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
pretty good match that one

624
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
so i grabbed that little image i did an

625
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
image reverse search

626
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
and had a look at layla stars junior

627
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
football club

628
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
and i was able to find this image which

629
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,360
is the exact

630
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,559
type of shirt that we had in that

631
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,960
europol case so that was quite

632
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,679
quite effective and also gave a location

633
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,440
as to where this was because again

634
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,039
there was no context provided with that

635
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
photo whatsoever no location it could

636
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,280
have been

637
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,360
in the us in the uk or anywhere in the

638
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,720
world

639
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,640
so this led us to australia and that's

640
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
to a specific part of australia which is

641
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,799
quite interesting

642
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,480
so this one uh this is a little bit

643
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,840
graphic this video so i'm going to try

644
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,559
and pause it

645
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,280
on specific parts um but this is looking

646
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,200
at reflections which is quite important

647
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
because a lot of people

648
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
may look at a photo or a video and give

649
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,679
up

650
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,760
but often time you might be able to see

651
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,280
something in the reflection and there's

652
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,080
some cool

653
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,679
i think it's an old james bond movie

654
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,440
that looked into the contact lenses of

655
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,600
someone to identify as something else

656
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
um or maybe that might have been another

657
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,679
movie but yeah uh so this is looking

658
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,559
into reflections in sudan

659
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,720
this was during the sudanese uprising of

660
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,200
2018-2019

661
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
um there was a violent crackdown a lot

662
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,200
of paramilitary reshooting protesters on

663
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,320
the streets

664
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
i was going through on twitter

665
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
geolocating every single time a person

666
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,600
was shot

667
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,919
this was one of the difficult ones um

668
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,240
i'm going to mute the audio for this

669
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,679
because there's a lot of gunfire and a

670
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,280
lot of screaming

671
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,200
um i'll have to skip

672
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
specific parts but there is a young man

673
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,960
that's been

674
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,320
shot in the abdomen here

675
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,840
um he's being carried um away

676
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,919
and then that's the end of the video

677
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,120
that was really hard to geolocate again

678
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
i skipped that because i don't want to

679
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,600
show blood and guts

680
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,880
or anything like that we have the same

681
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,799
sort of video here and what i'm going to

682
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,080
do is i'll

683
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,000
pause it at a specific point

684
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
where we have our clue

685
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,440
so if we go through

686
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
okay now i don't know if any of you saw

687
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,919
this but we had a reflection in the car

688
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,280
window of a building

689
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,400
with writing on the top so what we can

690
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
do is obviously it's a reflection and

691
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,080
obviously it's tilted so we can tilt it

692
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
up right we can tilt that we can

693
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
change that because it's a mirror image

694
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,799
so we can change it the way it's

695
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,400
supposed to be facing

696
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,559
um i did an image reverse search on this

697
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,600
in google

698
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,080
and typing in cartoon sedan

699
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,360
eventually i went through a heap of

700
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
results i couldn't really find too much

701
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
but it led me to looking at something

702
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,000
called the bank of khartoum

703
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,120
which is a popular bank and this led me

704
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,559
to a specific branch

705
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,000
the one in cartoon that matches exactly

706
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,360
the the one that we're looking at

707
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,760
because we also have these trees and we

708
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,720
have this sort of

709
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,799
apartment block uh next to it as well so

710
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,240
i was able to document that just by

711
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,679
using the reflection

712
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,559
um of that vehicle which is quite useful

713
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,360
um

714
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,440
so here's another part of the case study

715
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,640
i want to look at which is about

716
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,919
cross-referencing

717
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,840
all of the information that's online

718
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,039
many of you i mean

719
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
you're watching here on twitch you've

720
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,960
probably seen this through twitter

721
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,799
you probably have a facebook account and

722
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
instagram there is so much content being

723
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
uploaded around the world every single

724
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,520
day

725
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
it's likely that a photo has been taken

726
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,880
in the place that you're trying to

727
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
geolocate something at

728
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,080
so this was an image that was sent my

729
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,840
way

730
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,919
um with the context that

731
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,159
this bitcoin transfer center was

732
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,120
involved

733
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,600
in the illicit funding of al qaeda

734
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
terrorist networks

735
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
um so we wanted to have a look at where

736
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
this exact location was

737
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,799
and if we could geolocate this now it's

738
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,840
quite difficult because there's no

739
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,919
landmarks in the background

740
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,840
but again assessing what's in the image

741
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,120
what's in the foreground what's in the

742
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,840
background

743
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,080
okay cool we've got some details here

744
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
don't we um

745
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
i specifically looked at the telegram

746
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,720
channel

747
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,279
so when we look at the telegram channel

748
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,720
we get a pretty big dip

749
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,799
off it says this is the first northern

750
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,360
branch this is the bitcoin digital

751
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,159
exchange

752
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,400
area and it gives us an address as well

753
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,919
al shahab street

754
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,279
uh next to the church in idlib city um

755
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,880
okay cool so let's have a look at that

756
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,159
on google maps so we've got a couple of

757
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:14,960
churches here

758
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
two right next to each other and for the

759
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,679
life of me i could not find this

760
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,080
whatsoever on that map i could not

761
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,880
identify this location on that map it

762
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,960
was impossible for me

763
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,919
so my second thing my backup is always

764
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,480
to go

765
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,799
again through the massive amount of data

766
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,919
that's online

767
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,320
specifically on facebook which is just a

768
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
catalogue of the world's photos

769
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,360
and videos um this is discover idlib

770
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,600
city i love these sorts of pages because

771
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
they're essentially like a

772
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,559
like a local community post for a city

773
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,880
um whether there's a flooding whether

774
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,760
there's something

775
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,279
like a bombing that's happened whether

776
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,039
there's a party whether there's street

777
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,480
renovations

778
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,320
you name it they'll probably put it in

779
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
these sorts of facebook pages

780
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,679
scrolling through this facebook page i

781
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,360
eventually found this photo

782
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
and it stuck out to me this one because

783
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
there's a little fingerprint again

784
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
that fingerprint of detail of the side

785
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,799
of this building

786
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,240
which actually really matched up with

787
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,120
the original one that we had back here

788
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,559
and i thought okay are there any other

789
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,320
features that match in this

790
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,120
well there are so this is actually a

791
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,760
mirror

792
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,640
of this photo is taken down here so

793
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,000
they're kind of mirroring each

794
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
other we know that because

795
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,320
these two windows and the image on the

796
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,799
right

797
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,320
and this sign in this air conditioning

798
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
unit can actually be

799
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,279
seen in the image on the left down here

800
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,080
now having these two together it makes

801
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,320
it

802
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,120
much easier to geolocate this image and

803
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
so now we can say okay cool

804
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,440
we've got the exact coordinates and we

805
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,919
can

806
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,960
use that for further investigations for

807
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,120
for instance to assist law enforcement

808
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,360
or to assist research as well

809
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,559
so that's quite useful okay cool so i've

810
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,000
gone through a couple of small little

811
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
case studies on on some of the

812
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,559
difficult things that i've found in

813
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,760
geolocation

814
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
and some of the research that i've done

815
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,200
but now i'm going to have a look at why

816
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
it's useful because

817
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,039
it's not just about finding something on

818
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,480
a map and putting it on twitter for

819
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,919
retweets and likes

820
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,480
it's about building on that research

821
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,600
that you've done

822
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,840
diving into the detail so some of these

823
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,360
are going to have some politically

824
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,520
sensitive subjects in them

825
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
again i don't endorse any of the actions

826
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,159
in them this is merely for research

827
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,919
so the first case study i'm going to go

828
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,240
through here is about using location

829
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
finding for verification

830
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,520
and this is a video that was uploaded by

831
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
the white house

832
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,120
earlier this year during the

833
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,240
uh protests that were happening um

834
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,520
around the us specifically the video

835
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
was about uh bricks that were being laid

836
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,720
out on streets so pallets of bricks

837
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,559
bricks that were being laid out on

838
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,880
streets and and protesters

839
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,919
may have been using them um this video

840
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,279
was interesting because

841
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,720
it was actually a compilation of videos

842
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,840
that have been uploaded

843
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,080
in the past 48 hours on twitter and

844
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,679
facebook

845
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,279
by random users by civilians

846
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,399
about the content of bricks and and the

847
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,640
use in the protests and things like that

848
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,279
so i'll play the video for you um

849
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,640
so this guy is saying

850
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
you know you got to do better where are

851
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,720
these bricks coming from

852
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
there's another one person saying

853
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
there's another pile of these randomized

854
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,679
bricks

855
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,720
um you know there's there's some

856
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,399
authorities looking at these bricks

857
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,080
this person here is saying that there's

858
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,000
no construction but there's bricks left

859
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
there for the protesters

860
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,360
um and and all of these sorts of videos

861
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,120
and we're seeing a pattern here as well

862
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,679
that oh okay well the narrative is

863
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,600
these bricks and now you've got videos

864
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,520
of protesters using

865
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,240
um these bricks against cars and things

866
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,840
like that

867
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,760
so it was quite interesting to see the

868
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,679
narrative about these

869
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,919
now i started to have a look at all of

870
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,120
these videos just

871
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,600
in in the in the nature of being a fan

872
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,240
of geolocation and location finding

873
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,760
and going through all of these videos it

874
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,919
was quite strange because the narrative

875
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,760
didn't seem to match up

876
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,159
for instance the narrative was that

877
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,840
these bricks were being put there

878
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,880
to be used by protesters the street was

879
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
empty one night

880
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,440
it's full of bricks the next night

881
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
during the protests

882
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,679
so for instance this is two of the

883
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,240
videos

884
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,520
two screenshots from um the

885
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,440
the the white house video that we just

886
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,559
saw uh

887
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,159
one taken in the day one taken in the

888
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,520
nine and we can see it's the same video

889
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
because you know we've got the witches

890
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,240
hat um marco cone here we've got this

891
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,039
little rag

892
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,240
or piece of clothing um on the on top of

893
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,200
the stack there and

894
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
the bricks are in the right shape so the

895
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,240
first thing

896
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,039
we could use to we could do to verify

897
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:11,440
that

898
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,039
is geolocate this okay so

899
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,039
um in the original video i saw that

900
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,720
there are near a clock tower

901
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,320
i've never been to north carolina before

902
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,520
but all i did was typed in fayetteville

903
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,720
and and central area and i found a clock

904
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,399
tower on google street view

905
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,880
that's great so this is the same place

906
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,840
um that we

907
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
can identify as the the bricks so we've

908
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,120
geolocated that

909
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,080
okay what does that mean so what let's

910
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,679
go a step further

911
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
so i always again just like that

912
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,919
cross-referencing building upon what's

913
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,159
available online

914
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,080
i went on youtube and had a look at

915
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
videos around

916
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,200
fayetteville usually people drive with

917
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,799
dash cams and they just upload this

918
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,279
stuff on youtube for god knows why

919
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,000
except to maybe help people like me um

920
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,039
and this was a

921
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,679
video that was uploaded on may 24 which

922
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,520
means it was filmed before may 24

923
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,279
which is about two months before the

924
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,159
protests um started and before this

925
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,399
this other event was happening in north

926
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,919
carolina

927
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,279
following this video around it's a 30

928
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,480
minute video so i'm not going to play it

929
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,440
to you

930
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
but following this video around it took

931
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,880
me to this street the street that i'm

932
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,679
after

933
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,520
and we can see the bricks on the right

934
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
there um

935
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,880
with the exact match of what they were

936
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,039
before so it just shows that they

937
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
weren't actually placed

938
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,440
during the protest they were there for

939
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,039
at least two to three months

940
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,840
before the protests um also about

941
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,520
fayetteville phase two

942
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
uh the pole place was undergoing a

943
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,039
cleanup and a little bit of renovation

944
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,880
for sidewalks and things like that

945
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,960
the bricks had been there and this

946
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
happened in a lot of the other

947
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,120
videos as well so i obviously went on

948
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
twitter to

949
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
let let the white house know that maybe

950
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,880
some of these things might not be

951
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,600
verified and might be a different

952
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,320
narrative

953
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,760
and lo and behold the white house

954
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,519
deleted that so um

955
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,720
that's interesting going into um and and

956
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
so yeah what we did in that one was

957
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,279
essentially

958
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,080
we geolocated something but then we took

959
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,919
it a step further by identifying what

960
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,120
was really in the video and that's why

961
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
it was useful in that case

962
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,279
so um i want to go into this one uh this

963
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,039
is also a disturbing video so i'm not

964
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,919
going to play the whole thing i'm going

965
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,760
to skip through bits

966
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,840
but the identification time of time

967
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,600
using satellite imagery

968
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,480
so this is going back to saddam in last

969
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
year in khartoum on june 3 when there

970
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,880
was a massacre

971
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,960
when paris military forces cracked down

972
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,320
on peaceful protesters

973
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,360
that around that same time there were

974
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,320
also

975
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,480
small breakouts actually happening in

976
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,960
other areas around the city as well

977
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,279
um and this is a video filmed by a young

978
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,159
daughter as

979
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,640
as one of the elderly women were beaten

980
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
up by two um

981
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,679
paramilitary um soldiers uh

982
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,960
with sticks so i'm not gonna play the

983
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
whole video i won't put it on loud

984
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,519
because there's a lot of screaming as

985
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,720
well

986
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,159
um but this was important

987
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,039
to document for the obvious reasons that

988
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,760
it's a it's an abuse of power

989
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,559
so what do we do okay we can start with

990
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,399
geolocation

991
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,120
again building the panorama of what

992
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,760
we've got

993
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
that we can see in the full range of the

994
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,360
video screenshots preview

995
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,039
stitching them together in a full range

996
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
of vision what have we got

997
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,960
we've got an orange rooftop we've got

998
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,039
some trees we've got a divider in the

999
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:37,679
road

1000
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,039
it's a couple of fingerprints that we

1001
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,799
can look for on satellite imagery to

1002
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,960
match up

1003
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
now we can build an angle um this took

1004
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,240
me about two hours

1005
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,960
to drive around the entire cartoon on

1006
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,840
google maps

1007
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,640
not real life uh looking for these sorts

1008
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
of this fingerprint essentially this

1009
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
building block of the image

1010
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,640
eventually i found this location um

1011
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,880
so it's got the divider in the road it's

1012
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,840
got the

1013
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,559
the orange sort of red roof as well and

1014
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,240
it's got these trees in this little sort

1015
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,159
of back street as well

1016
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,399
now we generally located that but

1017
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,919
there's been a lot of protests

1018
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,120
in sudan over the past several 10 20

1019
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,480
years

1020
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
so how do we know this is from protest

1021
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,679
in june

1022
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,799
and not another protest before so we can

1023
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,919
use something called a chronolocation

1024
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,559
to identify the time now the shadows

1025
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,760
weren't really too easy

1026
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,600
for me to use this one they weren't too

1027
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
clear so i can't try and

1028
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,799
do a shadow calculation or anything like

1029
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,559
that but this is where we start to get

1030
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,000
creative

1031
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,799
so you'll notice in the video that when

1032
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,399
this car drove past there was a

1033
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,279
reflection

1034
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,159
on the road in this puddle of liquid or

1035
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
water i assume

1036
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
and this was coming from out of the

1037
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,360
store that we can see

1038
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,039
here on the left in these images

1039
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,120
what we can do is we can turn to google

1040
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,240
earth

1041
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,640
and on google earth we can scroll back

1042
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,360
in time

1043
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,919
on satellite images now the imagery

1044
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,120
isn't really

1045
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,399
available daily or or every two days

1046
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,480
on google earth but we have enough

1047
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,239
imagery to start to have a look at what

1048
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,359
happened

1049
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,879
on in this area at that time

1050
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,960
and so scrolling back we've got we're

1051
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,399
looking at august

1052
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,839
uh 2019 so we can scroll back in time

1053
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,040
uh we're in july okay

1054
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,918
but wait now in june we can start to see

1055
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,639
some

1056
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,800
see some dark patches in the middle of

1057
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,960
that and that's liquid that's building

1058
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,040
up or some sort of water

1059
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,199
or residue that's building up in in the

1060
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,800
cracks on the road and so if we have a

1061
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,560
look at the second of june

1062
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,879
we can see that there's a full puddle

1063
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,639
that's out the front of that store where

1064
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
that woman was standing

1065
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,879
if we scroll back further just to

1066
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,440
further confirm our findings

1067
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,719
we can see that in march there was

1068
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,839
nothing and also in december 2018 there

1069
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,640
was nothing as well so that's quite

1070
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,599
interesting

1071
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,640
because now we can say okay well that

1072
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
enabled us to put this video in a

1073
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,280
position of time

1074
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
which is that we saw the reflection of

1075
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,040
the car driving past

1076
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,200
that reflection was coming off the water

1077
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,040
that was only present there

1078
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,160
in the beginning of june um so this is a

1079
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
way that we can start to get creative

1080
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,599
and that's something that is very hard

1081
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,880
to train a computer

1082
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,079
you could probably train a computer to

1083
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,480
geolocate something but using that next

1084
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
step of pivoting and being creative and

1085
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,760
critical thinking

1086
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,160
is is um something that's hard to

1087
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,320
replicate

1088
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
so that's where case studies come into

1089
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,839
you know causing that sort of

1090
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,079
creativity so another one that we did

1091
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,200
and this is through

1092
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,320
um bbc africa i which is a an

1093
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,440
investigative unit

1094
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,680
uh within the bbc is uh the

1095
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,119
identification of time

1096
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,160
using shadows um so this is an

1097
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
investigation we did

1098
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,960
in 2018 uh this video went viral

1099
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,240
on twitter um i'm going to mute this

1100
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,640
video

1101
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,560
this video went viral on twitter and i'm

1102
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,440
not going to play the whole thing

1103
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,720
because it is terrible

1104
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,760
it's cold it's chilling um to be honest

1105
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,960
it shouldn't have happened

1106
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,880
um these women and children are being

1107
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,640
walked down this dusty track

1108
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,119
they're being slapped they're being told

1109
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,160
will be arched

1110
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,640
which is short for boko haram issue

1111
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,000
and you can see the soldiers

1112
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,839
with their guns in a position of power

1113
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,359
slapping these women and children as

1114
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,040
they walk down this track and it's

1115
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,560
it's horrible um i'm not gonna play

1116
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,880
the rest of the video but they walk them

1117
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,480
off the track they blindfold them they

1118
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
kneel them down and they shoot them

1119
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,440
it's a cold chilling execution

1120
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,680
and to be honest i was pissed off when i

1121
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,119
saw this

1122
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,440
so first thing let's find who these

1123
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,960
people are how do we do it

1124
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,640
geolocation okay um we started have a

1125
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,040
looking

1126
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
having a look at mountain ranges for

1127
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,040
instance now we had an amazing

1128
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,400
team of analysts working together

1129
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,000
on a in a twitter dm to crack this case

1130
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,599
and again this hearts back to the

1131
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,119
original thing i had about

1132
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,720
the community and the power of

1133
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,200
collaboration this is a product

1134
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,720
of people working together and putting

1135
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,480
their heads together rather than

1136
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
an intelligence analyst sitting on their

1137
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
own trying to crack a case without

1138
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,240
talking to anyone

1139
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
the power that we got out of this was

1140
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,079
first we had context

1141
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,720
we were able to source together tips tip

1142
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,359
offs

1143
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,760
and it led us to a location we're able

1144
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,839
to look around that location

1145
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,839
and we started to get some pretty good

1146
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,040
results

1147
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
but that mountain range we're able to

1148
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,200
firm up to say okay

1149
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,960
we've got a location okay we're onto

1150
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,079
something

1151
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,079
let's dive into the detail where are we

1152
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,160
we're in a village called kuara mafa

1153
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,079
uh we're on the border of nigeria and

1154
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,520
cameroon which is

1155
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,440
already a conflict area with boko haram

1156
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,599
in the north nigeria

1157
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,880
let's go a step further can we analyze

1158
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
what's in the image

1159
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,959
yeah so we've got this path

1160
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,640
we've got these buildings in the

1161
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,119
background as well

1162
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,560
and you can start to see that we can

1163
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,520
really firm up every single fingerprint

1164
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,599
that's in this video with what's on

1165
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,720
satellite imagery

1166
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,920
there should not be anything that

1167
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,800
doesn't match so we've got these trees

1168
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,680
as well and just to be 100 sure

1169
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,720
i made a panorama of the entire video

1170
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,880
and took every single tree and found

1171
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
them all on satellite imagery

1172
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,280
well the ones that were available anyway

1173
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,320
because we had to rely on

1174
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,040
commercial satellite imagery too so

1175
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,720
going after that

1176
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,480
well we needed to find the window of

1177
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,920
time and

1178
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,680
again we started to use satellite

1179
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,119
imagery as well

1180
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,520
so for instance in satellite imagery

1181
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,560
from 2015 this building was there

1182
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,520
2014 it wasn't okay gives us a window of

1183
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,800
time

1184
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,520
in this one as well we have a building

1185
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,320
that's here

1186
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,160
in 2014 but it's not there

1187
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,160
in 2016. 2014 to 2016 is our window of

1188
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,119
time again

1189
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,920
we started with nothing no location no

1190
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,520
window of time whatsoever

1191
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,839
this is how we worked our way through it

1192
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,119
um as you can imagine

1193
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,760
that twitter dm that small open source

1194
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,800
community of

1195
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,359
just a handful of analysts we're pretty

1196
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,839
excited at the fact that we're cracking

1197
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,960
a an investigation into a horrible thing

1198
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,720
and we're coming closer to identifying

1199
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,880
who is responsible

1200
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,480
but we could really narrow that window

1201
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,160
of time down and there's an analyst

1202
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,960
called

1203
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,079
sector 035 that came up with this idea

1204
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,440
and you should follow him on twitter by

1205
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,160
the way or

1206
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,440
then you should um and they came up with

1207
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
the idea of

1208
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,960
turning this essentially a human rights

1209
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,119
abuser into a sundial

1210
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,880
by doing a shadow calculation this is

1211
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,200
called chronolocation

1212
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,839
you take shadow so the angle that the

1213
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,520
shadow causes

1214
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
or that is causing the shadow the

1215
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,760
direction of the sunlight as well

1216
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,680
and with those two results you

1217
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,880
essentially have

1218
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,079
what would be commonly looked at as uh

1219
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,119
as a sundial and that enabled us to

1220
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,680
really narrow that window of time down

1221
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,319
to the space of a week

1222
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,599
and we did that process through

1223
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,160
geolocation identifying the date through

1224
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,599
satellite imagery

1225
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,440
and then we're able to identify who is

1226
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,920
responsible and that time was important

1227
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,520
because it really gave us a small window

1228
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,720
of time of march 20 2015 to april 5

1229
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,160
2015.

1230
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,400
we eventually went on to identify the

1231
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,079
people that were responsible

1232
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,480
um and they have been charged as well

1233
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,000
and there's still a court process

1234
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,119
going through that but they were

1235
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,000
arrested which is great news and

1236
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,480
that's again this this small case study

1237
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,319
that i've i've used in this much bigger

1238
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,920
presentation

1239
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
is just goes to show the power of

1240
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,359
collaboration of

1241
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,560
you know the things that we're doing for

1242
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,280
hackathons with um with trace labs and

1243
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,000
and the

1244
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,920
missing persons hack funds with the

1245
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
ncptf group

1246
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,560
it's this sort of community and unpaid

1247
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,040
hours that's so important

1248
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,240
um so i want to go on to maybe

1249
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,440
a different side of location finding

1250
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,119
which is something that's quite close to

1251
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,800
my heart which is about influence

1252
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,160
operations

1253
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,280
um and and the research in that field um

1254
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,720
it's quite important because as you can

1255
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,440
see

1256
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,119
most of the conversation that i've been

1257
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,880
having with you guys

1258
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,920
and sorry the presentation um is

1259
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,560
about narratives it's about challenging

1260
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,079
narratives with facts

1261
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,079
and about investigating using open

1262
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,599
source intelligence to

1263
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,359
set the wrong doings in in in stone

1264
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,520
and to expose them and also to find the

1265
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,960
truth as well

1266
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,240
um and this was an important one because

1267
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
what was happening on the ground were

1268
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,160
the same things i've been geolocating

1269
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,280
there's people being killed there's

1270
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,079
government abuse there's one group being

1271
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,920
oppressed by a much bigger group

1272
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,440
but online all we're seeing is this

1273
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,000
um it's essentially a propaganda

1274
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,119
campaign about

1275
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,520
the great work that indonesia is doing

1276
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,760
in west papua

1277
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,880
and none of this is wrong of course

1278
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,640
but it is wrong when you're spamming

1279
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,319
hashtags on twitter

1280
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,800
with west papua genocide and free west

1281
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,599
papa

1282
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,960
for investigators like me that are

1283
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,640
looking into human rights abuses and

1284
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,800
this is all the information i'm getting

1285
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
hundreds and hundreds of times from

1286
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,280
multiple amounts of fake accounts

1287
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,599
it makes life really difficult i wanted

1288
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,200
to know where this network was coming

1289
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,760
from

1290
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,400
so let's try and geolocate this network

1291
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,520
we can see that

1292
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,119
it's obviously some sort of automated

1293
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,640
massive spam network

1294
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,160
there's hundreds of accounts posting

1295
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,880
this same text same mistakes

1296
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,920
same hashtags okay so let's look at

1297
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,880
marco

1298
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,359
two six seven zero zero four two zero

1299
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,000
who are you

1300
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,720
where are you from okay so we do an

1301
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,079
image reverse search like we've done

1302
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:06,720
before

1303
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,880
yandex well he's listed on every single

1304
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,560
dating website so probably it's a fake

1305
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,160
picture of some guy that has no idea

1306
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,440
what's going on

1307
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,560
um so i feel very sorry for marco

1308
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,400
um but he seems to be on a lot of

1309
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,079
different dating websites this account's

1310
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,440
probably not real

1311
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,480
okay so what i did was i used a github

1312
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,079
account now this is written by

1313
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,000
again another member of the open source

1314
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,480
community for free for people like me to

1315
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
use

1316
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,839
it's a script that allows me to see more

1317
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,880
details

1318
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,720
that are publicly available on twitter

1319
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,800
like time codes for instance

1320
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,280
so i scraped marco's friends and all of

1321
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,480
the people that were

1322
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,000
essentially uploading this stuff on the

1323
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,920
same twitter hashtag

1324
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
i found that they were automated because

1325
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,800
we can see the patterns again

1326
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,040
fingerprints

1327
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,359
3254 3256 these guys are uploading in

1328
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,640
patterns

1329
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,240
so these are bots they're automated

1330
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,319
accounts okay cool

1331
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,920
how can we go a step further let's have

1332
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,839
a look at his network so it's created

1333
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,880
his entire network

1334
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,960
of friends and i visualized this in

1335
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,880
gephi to have a look at

1336
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,640
okay maybe we can find some bigger

1337
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,240
accounts and find some more details to

1338
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,319
get locations

1339
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,560
there was one account that i identified

1340
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,000
which is called west papua id

1341
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,640
it had a url and twitter account so i

1342
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,480
went to that website

1343
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,720
i was working with again another member

1344
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,640
of the open source community

1345
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,720
um from australia called elise who is

1346
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
amazing researcher

1347
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,560
and again it just goes this goes to show

1348
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,880
this power of collaboration so together

1349
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,800
we worked on busting this case and

1350
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,400
through this we're able to find this

1351
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,720
website for instance which is uploading

1352
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,960
the similar propaganda material

1353
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,560
similar narratives about west papua

1354
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,480
who owned this website where did it come

1355
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,599
from

1356
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,200
well first of all we could maybe have a

1357
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,800
look at facebook which has page

1358
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,200
transparency options down there

1359
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,040
usually it does give a location as to

1360
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,640
the people that manage a page

1361
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,400
this time it didn't it just showed us

1362
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,839
that this page was advertising

1363
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,000
propaganda in the netherlands

1364
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,319
which i still to this day i don't know

1365
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,040
why

1366
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,960
but again going back to the website what

1367
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,520
can we do maybe we can have a look at

1368
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,359
okay um what about the registration

1369
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,920
so domain registration details who is

1370
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,240
registration i can details

1371
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,760
okay so this person forgot to

1372
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,040
limit their registration details and

1373
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,119
we have a name organization email and a

1374
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,400
phone number as well

1375
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,000
what can we do with the phone number

1376
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,520
that's not the end of the game

1377
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,480
but what it does give us is an area code

1378
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,560
which is a location so we've almost

1379
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,079
geolocated the people behind this

1380
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,520
propaganda network but we can go a step

1381
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,960
further than that

1382
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,359
again phone number save it in whatsapp

1383
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,560
you get a profile image

1384
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,440
yandex image reverse search great i've

1385
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
got a freelancer.com profile

1386
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,160
i've got linkedin profiles and now i can

1387
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,520
see that this is actually coming from a

1388
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,560
marketing firm

1389
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,040
based in jakarta we've just geolocated

1390
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,079
the bot network

1391
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,079
we can confirm that by having a look at

1392
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,280
the owner of the company

1393
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,760
and seeing the website that he owns

1394
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,599
these are the websites

1395
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,800
they're all about west papua

1396
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,359
independence and surviving west papua

1397
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,880
they're trying to control this narrative

1398
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
and push this agenda

1399
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,560
the results of finding all of this

1400
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,400
facebook removed the network

1401
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,920
twitter gave a nice little shout out to

1402
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,760
the report and uh there's a 40 page

1403
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,720
report

1404
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,920
okay cool um so i want to finish

1405
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,359
with a much lighter investigation

1406
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,000
um and this is a cool little geolocation

1407
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,200
challenge to finish on

1408
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,000
about john mcafee i'm sure most of you

1409
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,920
are aware of john mcafee and maybe this

1410
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,599
investigation

1411
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,720
but this was a nice little bit of

1412
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,200
research that i did um some time ago

1413
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,040
um john mcafee if you don't know started

1414
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
up the mcafee virus scanner

1415
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,400
which i'm sure many of you are well

1416
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,640
aware of um cool so it was a nice little

1417
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,400
challenge an incentive for a free beer

1418
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,599
with john mcafee

1419
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,040
provided you're in london that's the

1420
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,680
first hint he's going to be in london

1421
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,079
okay so what do we have in the image

1422
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,520
again going back to those original

1423
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,240
things

1424
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,560
we've got context foreground background

1425
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,960
map markings trial and error

1426
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,520
so in the background it's quite empty

1427
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,720
there's also a

1428
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,760
like a gas station or something so

1429
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,599
i went straight away on google service

1430
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,040
stations in europe

1431
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,240
hey cool we've got something that

1432
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,880
matches up the colors it's so petroleum

1433
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,000
going a step further let's forget that

1434
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,640
one

1435
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,200
let's try another way of geolocating

1436
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,680
this

1437
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,079
so he said provided you're in london and

1438
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,319
yesterday on the way to london

1439
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,079
that gives us a point in time where was

1440
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,440
he coming from

1441
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,359
so this was further down his twitter

1442
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,000
timeline um

1443
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,680
and it said my security teams arrived to

1444
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,280
escort us to england okay where's he

1445
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,040
coming from do you locate this photo

1446
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,319
hotel shlika in munich great so

1447
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,480
go on google maps and set a course from

1448
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,240
hotel shlika to london

1449
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,160
and again remembering we have so

1450
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,079
petroleum let's have a look at all the

1451
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,680
esso petroleums in an open

1452
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,720
area next to a highway and

1453
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,319
i come across this location it's useful

1454
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,520
because we have this little hut and a

1455
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,480
flagpole

1456
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,359
right here we have the roof of this

1457
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,480
place

1458
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,720
right here and all of those match up

1459
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,359
in sync so that was quite a nice little

1460
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,800
piece of research

1461
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,359
that i was able to do there sadly i'm

1462
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,160
still waiting

1463
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,880
on my free beer um so definitely don't

1464
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,000
have that yet

1465
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,440
but what we've done there is just

1466
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,280
identification of points so we've

1467
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,880
geolocated the image

1468
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,720
we've identified the root of travel

1469
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,400
we've identified identified the location

1470
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,280
of image and even

1471
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,040
after all that i still didn't get my br

1472
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,359
so very sad about that

1473
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:49,839
but what it does go is to show

1474
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,040
this does show a sort of like a pattern

1475
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,240
um sorry

1476
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,480
a pattern in sort of the the context the

1477
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,839
foreground the background the map

1478
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,839
markings and trial and error

1479
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,599
which is really important for the

1480
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,040
community um

1481
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,760
when we're sort of going into this stuff

1482
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,640
and

1483
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,160
this is why i'm sharing case studies

1484
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,240
with you it's about

1485
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,079
creativity and sharing this with the

1486
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,000
community and i really appreciate a lot

1487
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,599
of your feedback on this

1488
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,720
um as well as you know

1489
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,480
watch what the other people do i mean

1490
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,319
i'm not a specialist

1491
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,680
in most of this stuff i'm just a

1492
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,920
researcher but there's so many

1493
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
amazing people that are going to be

1494
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,599
presenting at this

1495
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,760
and so that's that's really sort of you

1496
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,200
know important to look but please join

1497
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,520
the community and check this stuff out

1498
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,720
um i always like to recommend people to

1499
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,559
follow on twitter

1500
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,640
and i know there's probably big lists as

1501
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,559
well and if you want to follow anyone on

1502
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,079
twitter follow all these people

1503
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,920
but if i can recommend one single person

1504
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,440
to follow um

1505
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,440
it would probably be this one here

1506
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,960
carlos so i work with carlos

1507
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,480
i volunteer with carlos in some of the

1508
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,359
research for the nc ptf project the

1509
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,000
child protection project in some of the

1510
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,760
geolocation

1511
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,880
this person is a king in in creativity

1512
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,280
research critical thinking and case

1513
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,480
studies

1514
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,280
um he doesn't tweet much but when he

1515
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,760
does

1516
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,319
it's it's amazing in-depth

1517
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,760
groundbreaking research

1518
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,240
it's quality over quantity but i think

1519
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,000
the reason why i'd like to promote

1520
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,240
him to follow is because he puts in so

1521
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,559
many countless amounts of hours

1522
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,520
into work that is so important in this

1523
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,559
field

1524
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,760
and i think this is why this fundraising

1525
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,280
really exists

1526
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,359
is for people like this to keep doing

1527
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,359
this sort of work and to do it better

1528
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,680
to have more resources to have it more

1529
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,119
organized for them

1530
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,040
the work that this guy has done over the

1531
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,359
past at least month

1532
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,040
i think he's actually saved people

1533
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,680
and i think he's saved children as well

1534
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,240
um

1535
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,960
please follow him on twitter and also

1536
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,720

uh is presenting here and check out

1541
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,000
their case studies and this research

1542
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,720
it's so valuable the training is really

1543
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,920
expensive to buy

1544
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
from professional async training

1545
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,119
agencies

1546
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,119
um but you're getting such valuable

1547
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,400
content for free

1548
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,800

and um if there's any questions i think

1552
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,359
i might answer

1553
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,440
some questions now if any have come

1554
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,599
through to ask you

1555
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,000
uh but ben can i just say what an

1556
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,079
absolutely fantastic presentation

1557
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,640
seriously i i'm sitting here blown away

1558
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,839
absolutely blown away

1559
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,520
um i don't know i'll probably switch my

1560
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,440
camera on actually that my help

1561
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,119
um right okay i've got some i've got

1562
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,839
some questions as well

1563
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,280
um so there are there are a few

1564
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,400
questions here as well

1565
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,760
so um bloke um

1566
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,960
asks how how does the work uh ben does

1567
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,960
affect his mental health um especially

1568
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,599
when some

1569
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,599
uh some of it could be quite difficult

1570
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,920
and involves in your humane behaviors of

1571
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,240
others

1572
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,559
um yeah that's a really good question i

1573
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,800
think that's that's something that also

1574
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,559
needs to be researched and promoted a

1575
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,280
lot more

1576
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,640
in this community as well especially

1577
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,440
as groups like ncptf start up a lot more

1578
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,040
in in research

1579
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,480
where humans aren't necessarily exposed

1580
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:26,960
to

1581
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,680
to horrible images but more the horrible

1582
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,680
concepts of what can be done

1583
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,119
in this world that we're not used to

1584
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,359
seeing um but just from

1585
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,520
like little tips that i do if there's a

1586
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,359
horrific video i try not to blast it

1587
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,559
full on the screen

1588
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,359
i usually watch it on my phone um as

1589
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,400
well

1590
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,800
um watching it in black and white

1591
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,480
turning the sound off as well so you're

1592
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,119
not

1593
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,960
fully immersed in this situation whether

1594
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,800
it be a protest whether it be a violent

1595
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,680
video

1596
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,119
and just really trying to get yourself

1597
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,040
away from it so i keep a rubik's cube

1598
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,760
near my desk at all times i'm trying to

1599
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,119
get quicker at cubing

1600
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,200
and it just gets my mind off a subject

1601
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,400
so um

1602
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,640
also the pomodoro technique i use which

1603
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,559
is a little thing in google chrome

1604
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,400
it just locks your computer out every 40

1605
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,160
minutes and makes you take a five or ten

1606
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,200
minute break

1607
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,520
so that you can stop see the chicken see

1608
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,680
the goats or walk around the city and

1609
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,839
cook some food or something so yeah that

1610
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,119
sounds amazing yeah that's a good idea

1611
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,400
stepping away is really important i

1612
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,520
guess if you're dealing with this kind

1613
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,319
of images or

1614
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,800
videos and stuff like this okay i've got

1615
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,400
just time for one more question to

1616
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,160
happen before we transition to the next

1617
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,119
speaker

1618
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,040
um so i'll ask um cyber shenanigans

1619
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,440
um how are you first made aware

1620
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,839
of these

1621
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,079
i think we lost you there do we i think

1622
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:54,720
we lost

1623
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,240
you i'm just trying to have a look at

1624
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,319
the question on twitch to see

1625
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,640
i gotta hear it how are you first made

1626
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,480
aware of these cases

1627
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,400
are they tasked to you or do you come

1628
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,800
across them on media

1629
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,119
um yeah good question uh most of the

1630
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,960
cases i actually just come across

1631
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,359
uh on social media um i think it's the

1632
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,400
sort of

1633
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,440
um curiosity that i have and i think a

1634
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,200
lot of people have as well

1635
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,440
um and and i guess i mean it's it's

1636
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,960
horrible to think of but i also treat it

1637
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,000
a little bit like a computer

1638
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,079
game if i see something i try and

1639
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,599
challenge it i try and

1640
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,960
you know have a look at it and dive a

1641
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,960
little bit further into it

1642
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,720
and i think the more you do it the more

1643
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,480
you know what to

1644
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,359
what to watch out for as well um but i

1645
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,720
think that the important thing is i'll

1646
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,760
never task

1647
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
these things i find them myself just on

1648
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,280
social media and that's

1649
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,319
that's why i like doing these

1650
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,880
presentations because i want to try and

1651
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,960
influence so many of you

1652
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,079
who are amazing researchers and ocean

1653
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,720
analysts and hackers and programmers

1654
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,440
you can do this stuff too um and and i

1655
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,040
think the more people that do it the

1656
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,119
better

1657
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,319
yeah that definitely answered this

1658
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,240
question i think yeah apologies my

1659
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,440
internet dropped off amazing

1660
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,079
it's time for that time

1661
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,359
