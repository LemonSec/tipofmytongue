loves to travel when there isn't a

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,600
global pandemic happening of course

41
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,799
and playing super smash brothers melee

the content team and everyone here for

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,759

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,200
with us we really appreciate having you

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,240

uh looking forward to your presentation

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
here so i will get out of the way and

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,000
pass it over to you

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
thank you griffin for the great intro

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,920
and just quick thank you to the whole

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
content team for putting on this

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
awesome event so far it's been really

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
cool listening to

56
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,320
all the other speakers i guess um input

57
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
on the intel field and

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
basically every how everything is

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
interweaved and connected

60
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
in in some way so hopefully i can shed

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,320
some light

62
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
um on that from a different perspective

63
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,000
and the topic i'll be talking about

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
today is cryptocurrency and the evolving

65
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,479
threat

66
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,560
of ransomware so quick disclaimer

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,959
this research was done in my own accord

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,239
it's not directly

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,560
uh related to my work at the mitre

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,920
corporation or

71
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,319
just known simply as mitre so i just

72
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
wanted to put that out there as a quick

73
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
disclaimer

74
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,879
so like griffin already said um a lot of

75
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,680
this stuff was

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
already covered in the initial bio but i

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,480
am a cyber security engineer at mitre

78
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
which is a us-based

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
not-for-profit organization that does

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
research and development

81
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
for both the federal government and just

82
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
putting out public solutions

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
for private industry and just the

84
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
general public to use

85
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,319
so if you are somewhat

86
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
i guess familiar with the threat cyber

87
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,879
threat intel world um we have something

88
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,200
called the attack framework which is

89
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
a knowledge base of adverb adversary

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
techniques in the wild so

91
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,599
we'll take uh noted events from both

92
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,760
nation states and cyber criminals and

93
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,680
and put it together for people to to

94
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,360
implement within their own

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
security posture so the title of this

96
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
slide is actually

97
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
a reference to one of the techniques in

98
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,239
the attack framework

99
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
so go ahead check it out if you you have

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,519
the time

101
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
um so some of my interests include cyber

102
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,360
threat intelligence and just threat

103
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,239
intelligence

104
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,280
in general adversary emulation

105
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
so that's a combination of red teaming

106
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
slash ethical hacking

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,799
plus threat intelligence so taking what

108
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,319
what's observed in the wild and

109
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,200
combining it

110
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,799
with legitimate red red teaming

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,720
industrial control systems internet of

112
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,920
things really

113
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,319
public facing devices that you know have

114
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,440
some kind of stake

115
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
on the internet blockchain so obviously

116
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
i'm interested in blockchain given my

117
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,879
talk is centered around cryptocurrency

118
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,599
and

119
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,280
just ransomware in general and then

120
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,879
cloud so i've had some

121
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,879
previous work in cloud security and i

122
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,560
think just emerging technologies in

123
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,599
general is

124
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
definitely a field that i will continue

125
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
to be interested in

126
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
so some of my previous roles include

127
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
working as a technology consultant at

128
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,000
ibm

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
working as a program director of

130
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
cybersecurity for nslc

131
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
or the national student leadership

132
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,799
conference i'm pursuing a master's in

133
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
applied intelligence to supplement

134
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
my my main interest in threat

135
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,399
intelligence and and ceti

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,918
um i guess just some general hobbies

137
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,440
about myself um

138
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
i've played piano for a good portion of

139
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
my life and

140
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,919
i am a big fan of various nerd fandoms

141
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,880
if you'll notice on

142
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
the right side i know this uh it's a

143
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
pretty weak collection compared to

144
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,360
some people who you know extensively

145
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,919
collect

146
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
funko pops and um you know other

147
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,759
portions of the nerd variety but um

148
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,440
another thing i've

149
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,680
picked up during quarantine at least is

150
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
bird watching so i'm by no means

151
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
an expert or even a novice at this point

152
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
but we went out bought a pair of

153
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
uh binoculars for myself you know

154
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
whenever i get the chance i'll go out

155
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,120
and just try to

156
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,759
find any i guess unique birds i don't

157
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,280
really know what entails a

158
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
unique bird at this point but hopefully

159
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
that's something i'll learn in the quick

160
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
feature

161
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
and then the most important point of

162
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
this presentation um

163
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,639
if there's anything you'll take away um

164
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,080
from this presentation the only thing

165
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
i'd want you to

166
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,400
learn about me is that i'm heavily

167
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,680
anti-pineapple on pizza

168
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
if you want to debate with me about that

169
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
you know after the

170
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
presentation after the discussion please

171
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,639
do but

172
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
um yeah i'm very very heavily

173
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
leaning more towards the that sentiment

174
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,960
so to understand the cryptocurrency and

175
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
ransomware threat landscape it's

176
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
important to have the

177
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,880
technological context on what actually

178
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
makes cryptocurrency

179
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
um so popular and that's really based on

180
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
uh the technology operating on the back

181
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
end and that's

182
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
what's called blockchain so we'll talk

183
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
about that for a little bit

184
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
so quick disclaimer again so this talk

185
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,600
is not going to be

186
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
any financial endorsement of any

187
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,199
specific cryptocurrencies

188
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
to invest in it's also not going to be a

189
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
super deep dive into

190
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
some of the cryptographic protocols of

191
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,960
what makes blockchain

192
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,919
secure but i will be covering you know

193
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,039
the general context

194
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,199
needed to understand blockchain and

195
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
ransomware from

196
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,280
a threat intel standpoint or an osint

197
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,639
standpoint

198
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,919
so that being said blockchain is

199
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,120
essentially a digital record or a ledger

200
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
that ledger is the term people in the

201
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
technology slash blockchain community

202
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
like to use

203
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
of transactions or information so

204
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
what differentiates a blockchain network

205
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,120
from a typical database or

206
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
an information store are these key

207
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
characteristics so

208
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,280
immutability meaning that once a

209
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,240
transaction is added to

210
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
the blockchain it can never be changed

211
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,759
and it can never be

212
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,120
deleted decentralization and it being

213
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
distributed so there's no

214
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,639
single point of failure for a blockchain

215
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
network transparency

216
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
so with the blockchain basically all the

217
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,599
historical data is available

218
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,120
um to be seen on the open web and i'll

219
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
go we'll talk about that a little later

220
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
on in the presentation

221
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,160
and like i mentioned it's

222
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
cryptographically secure so they're

223
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
really complex

224
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,919
cryptographic protocols that go into

225
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,880
blockchain

226
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
that make it a very desirable

227
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
choice for a security feature backend

228
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,039
and here are just the general steps of

229
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
how a blockchain works so i've covered

230
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,919
some of these already

231
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,919
but a user on a blockchain network will

232
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
request a transaction

233
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
that transaction is represented by a

234
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,960
block

235
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
that block is sent out to all the nodes

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
or other devices hosting a blockchain

237
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,240
node

238
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,160
and then the nodes will validate

239
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,280
exacted then it will be verified and it

240
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,319
will be added to

241
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,000
the chain essentially becoming the

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,479
blockchain

243
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
so there are some pretty important use

244
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
cases of how blockchain is circulating

245
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
around in just general society right now

246
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
and some of these include digital

247
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,199
identity so being able to prove who you

248
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:11,680
are

249
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
without necessarily you know leaking out

250
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
more information than you need to supply

251
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
chain making sure

252
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
every step of the supply chain is

253
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
secured

254
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,639
and hasn't been tampered with so

255
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
integrity is a huge

256
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
use case of blockchain health i.t so

257
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,919
implementing blockchain within a health

258
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,880
it

259
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,640
network to make sure that pii or hpi

260
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,279
isn't leaked out accidentally and

261
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
finances which we'll be focusing on

262
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,320
when it comes to cryptocurrency so

263
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
you might recognize some of these logos

264
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
um bitcoin is in the top left

265
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
monero ripple litecoin uh ethereum or

266
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,959
ether i should say

267
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,200
and dogecoin so these are some of the

268
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
most popular

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,360
cryptocurrencies that you've probably

270
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
seen around in the news if you

271
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,200
um aren't too privy to keeping up with

272
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,399
cryptocurrency news

273
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,240
um so we'll talk about that a little bit

274
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,519
and here is i believe the screenshot is

275
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
actually from may but it's pretty

276
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,160
similar to

277
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
um the current market cap of

278
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,839
cryptocurrencies in today's society uh

279
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,040
bitcoin will always

280
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,399
be on the top on top it's the most

281
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,880
popular one ethereum

282
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,120
is also very very popular normally

283
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
second and then you'll notice some of

284
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,040
the other

285
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
ones so what

286
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
differentiates a cryptocurrency like

287
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,200
bitcoin

288
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
from an ethereum and one thing to keep

289
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
in mind is that

290
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
cryptocurrency is really just an

291
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,000
application of

292
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
the blockchain so bitcoin is a

293
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,600
blockchain network ethereum is a

294
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
blockchain network but

295
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
these two serve different purposes

296
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,399
bitcoin

297
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,360
spurs as solely a cryptocurrency

298
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,080
platform

299
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,640
whereas ethereum is an application

300
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,360
platform

301
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
that has cryptocurrency functionality as

302
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
well so their

303
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,000
cryptocurrency is called ether but

304
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,079
ethereum is a computing platform

305
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,560
that can be used for application

306
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,440
development

307
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
and a unique thing to keep in mind about

308
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,880
ethereum

309
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
is that they have something called smart

310
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
contract functionality and that's

311
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,519
basically

312
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,680
implementing logical business rules

313
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,959
within the

314
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,920
the blockchain network to help transact

315
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
some kind of action

316
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,760
so it's not like you're just arbitrarily

317
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
throwing

318
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,959
uh random transactions on the blockchain

319
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,160
network

320
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,480
so those are the key differences between

321
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
uh a cryptocurrency like bitcoin and

322
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,440
ether

323
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
um another thing to note is the

324
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
consensus algorithm

325
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,680
so what that means is how a block is

326
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,399
added to

327
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,200
the blockchain and both of these rely on

328
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
proof of work which is

329
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,560
essentially having to solve some complex

330
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
cryptographical math problem and you

331
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
might have heard of this

332
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
referred to as mining um so you mine

333
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,040
a bitcoin and then it's added to the

334
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,320
blockchain and it's the same with

335
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,120
ethereum

336
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
but the difference with ethereum is that

337
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
it's moving towards something that's

338
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,399
called

339
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
the proof of stake protocol meaning the

340
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,839
more

341
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,800
for lack of a better term stake you have

342
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,320
in the blockchain network the more

343
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,519
mining power you have

344
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,079
so if you own one percent of the

345
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,839
ethereum blockchain network

346
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
you'll have one percent of the mining

347
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,120
power meaning you'll have that much more

348
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
of an advantage over people

349
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,279
who don't have that much mining power i

350
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,640
should say

351
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,760
and then just another um random fact so

352
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
bitcoin has a max

353
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
fixed supply of 21 million so once it

354
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
hits that point there will no

355
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
be no more bitcoin mining once it hits

356
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,760
21 million

357
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,920
but with ethereum there's not a fixed

358
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,240
value

359
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,399
so going into the different kinds of

360
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
attacks that um

361
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
involve cryptocurrency there are three

362
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
subsets that i've kind of laid out here

363
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,279
and hopefully

364
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,920
the yellow isn't too difficult to see

365
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,800
but the first

366
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,440
portion is attempting to directly attack

367
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
the blockchain network

368
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,399
and there are these aren't inclusive

369
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,519
of all the blockchain attacks but some

370
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,040
of the most notable ones are a sybil

371
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,639
attack which is

372
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,760
you know attacking the blockchain

373
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,440
network under the guise of multiple

374
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
addresses

375
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
and operating as multiple people but

376
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,959
really you're just one entity or

377
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,800
one individual trying to attack the

378
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
blockchain network

379
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,680
the 51 attack is having more than

380
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,399
51 of the mining power on the blockchain

381
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,120
network

382
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,160
and allowing yourself or that gives you

383
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,399
the ability to influence the blockchain

384
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:34,880
network

385
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
because you have that mining power and

386
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
this is really not feasible on most

387
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
cryptocurrencies that are

388
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,720
circulating nowadays um it's more

389
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,600
prevalent

390
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
uh or i guess has been theoretically

391
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,800
done um

392
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,399
on smaller blockchain networks that are

393
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
just starting off so this won't happen

394
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,880
on

395
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,680
um on a bitcoin at least typically this

396
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
won't happen on bitcoin ethereum or even

397
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
dogecoin

398
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
um so there's a smart contract based

399
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
attack so like i mentioned ethereum is

400
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
smart contract based and there is a

401
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
vulnerability at some point

402
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,160
in ether the cryptocurrency application

403
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
of ethereum in which you could withdraw

404
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
withdraw transactions without having

405
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
that final validation step

406
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,160
that's key in adding a transaction to a

407
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,519
blockchain network

408
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,519
so those are some of the attacks that

409
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,959
directly attack

410
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
a blockchain network another key one is

411
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
something called cryptojacking

412
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
so that's essentially turning computing

413
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
devices into

414
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,279
a malicious mining tool so think of your

415
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,079
host device

416
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,920
your your laptop your desktop at home

417
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
your phones your tablets anything that

418
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
could potentially be used for

419
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
computing power to help a mining net

420
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
and help a malicious actor reach their

421
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,199
end goal of eventually

422
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,760
mining a cryptocurrency and then

423
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,839
ransomware which is something we'll

424
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,800
i guess for the rest of this

425
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
presentation is what we'll we'll focus

426
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,079
on most heavily but

427
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
essentially it's malware that will

428
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
encrypt your device and it'll also lock

429
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,800
the user files

430
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,120
and the device itself um until a certain

431
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
financial amount

432
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,440
is paid so that being said let's

433
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,160
let's do a brief history lesson into

434
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,639
what

435
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,320
ransomware has looked like throughout

436
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
the years and i can i can bet you

437
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,839
there's probably a good amount of people

438
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,160
who think ransomware is way newer than

439
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
it actually is

440
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
um and the first example i want to cover

441
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,720
is

442
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
what's called the aids or pc cyborg

443
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,680
ransomware and this first circulated in

444
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,279
1991 and the reason it was called the

445
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,240
aids pc cyborg ransomware is because

446
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,760
this was distributed

447
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,360
to an email list that was involved in

448
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,399
aids research

449
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,199
and pc cyborg was the fake corporation

450
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,680
that

451
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
made its victims pay out this certain

452
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,360
amount to

453
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,839
um you know at the end of the day for

454
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,800
this ransomware

455
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
and the way this would work was once

456
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
this piece of ransomware made its way

457
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
on a victim's device after i think 90

458
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,519
boots

459
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,920
it would encrypt the windows drive so

460
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,560
this was

461
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
particularly targeted towards microsoft

462
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,279
windows

463
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,240
so that was the first real piece of

464
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,440
ransomware that

465
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,800
started to circulate and gain traction

466
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,240
skipping quite a few years this is early

467
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,839
2000s at this point

468
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,519
and there is a piece of ransomware

469
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,920
called archives so it operates very

470
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
similarly

471
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,320
to um just any other typical ransomware

472
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
that was circular

473
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,279
circulating around at this point it

474
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,160
would make its way into a user's device

475
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,320
either through like a phishing email or

476
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
clicking on a malicious link

477
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,320
and it would encrypt the user's files

478
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,639
and until a certain amount was paid

479
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,560
you wouldn't get the password to decrypt

480
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
your files

481
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,880
but luckily in 2006 the password was

482
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,839
cracked and

483
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,800
because this is such old ransomware um

484
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,079
you probably won't be

485
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,360
targeted or affected by by this

486
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
at this point so in the case that you do

487
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
maybe you're messing around with an old

488
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,160
windows machine

489
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,120
or you know something of that nature the

490
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,040
password is readily available you could

491
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,160
um copy it from here this slide deck or

492
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,040
you know just look up archives password

493
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
ransomware password on google and

494
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
it should be the first thing that pops

495
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,040
up

496
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,279
so skipping over a few more years this

497
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,199
is another piece of ransomware

498
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
that is starting to evolve to

499
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,360
i guess match and start to

500
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
really rely on people's um fear and

501
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
rely on some of these scare tactics so

502
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,800
in this case this ransomware is

503
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,160
is posing under the guise of a specific

504
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,440
us government agency it actually lists

505
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,800
out both the fbi

506
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,440
uh the department of justice and the nsa

507
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
and it will trick the the victim

508
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,000
into again paying out a specific amount

509
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,639
and this is normally in a cash uh money

510
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,920
order

511
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,039
credit card payment that would have been

512
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,319
important to say before

513
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,079
but uh with this

514
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,599
it'll trick you by giving you

515
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,880
information about

516
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,359
your technical device or your location

517
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,880
uh if you could probably see in the

518
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,919
bottom left corner it lists off your ip

519
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,559
address

520
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,559
your location the operation operating

521
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,319
system that you're using

522
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
and you know essentially force you to

523
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
make this payment

524
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,280
and tell you that you've been looking at

525
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
illicit things on on the internet which

526
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,799
is more often than not

527
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,200
probably not true but because it's

528
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
posing as a legitimate

529
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,240
organization it coerces you to make this

530
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,720
payment

531
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,400
without really thinking and you're just

532
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
you know running around with your

533
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
your head's cut off so um this was

534
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
around the 2013

535
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,840
time frame so getting to a little closer

536
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,400
to

537
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
our current time frame and then we have

538
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,880
two pieces of ransomware that you've

539
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,840
probably run

540
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,480
into um in the past at least in passing

541
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,919
like seeing the name in

542
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
a news headline or um if you are

543
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
infoset infosec privy uh you've seen

544
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,480
these

545
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,039
just referenced in in the past so the

546
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,320
first one i want to talk about is

547
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,280
cryptolocker

548
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,240
and this directly follows the timeline

549
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
after

550
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,400
um the police ransomware september 2013

551
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,840
may 2014

552
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,919
and cryptolocker again was the piece of

553
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,960
ransomware that

554
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,320
was propagated by the game over zeus

555
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,120
botnet

556
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
and what a botnet is it is it'll

557
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
basically take over

558
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,039
uh a large network of computing devices

559
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,200
it's similar to crypto jacking like i

560
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,320
mentioned and

561
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,799
it'll help propagate whatever payload

562
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,880
that it's trying to

563
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
to unload so in this case it was the

564
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,000
cryptolocker

565
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
ransomware and there was a large

566
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,600
international

567
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,679
effort to help take down both

568
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,000
cryptolocker and the game over zeus

569
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
botnet so i believe it was the

570
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,240
department of justice from the united

571
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
states europol

572
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,919
um from the eu they all collaborated

573
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,440
together to

574
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,240
attack this infrastructure and at the

575
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,039
end of the day

576
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
they were able to retrieve the private

577
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
key which was stored

578
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
in a command and control server from

579
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
these malicious actors

580
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,440
so that's cryptolocker wannacry is a

581
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
little more infamous than that

582
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,679
i want to say and this is skipping over

583
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,720
four more years

584
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
uh after crypto locker in may 2017

585
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,960
so that's when it really started to

586
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
become popular

587
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
and what it did was it utilized uh one

588
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,440
of the exploits from the national

589
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,799
security agency called

590
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,120
eternalblue and attacked a specific

591
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
protocol called smb or the server

592
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,320
message block

593
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,679
on old outdated windows devices and

594
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,240
because in many organizations there's i

595
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
guess security patch management

596
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,799
at the time and i would say even to this

597
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,440
point

598
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,240
um cyber hygiene was not at the level it

599
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,960
needed to be

600
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
so um one anachry was able to use

601
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
eternal blue to help propagate itself

602
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
across all these

603
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,240
outdated windows machines so a result of

604
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,120
that was

605
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
microsoft releasing out-of-band security

606
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
updates for a lot of these

607
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
outdated machines and at some point they

608
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,080
were able to attribute it to north korea

609
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
and then the second date i have there

610
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,080
for for wannacry is august 2018 and

611
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,120
that's when

612
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,360
the i guess most recent variant of

613
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
wannacry

614
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,280
made its way around and it targeted a

615
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,080
taiwanese

616
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,240
semiconductor manufacturing company so

617
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
what makes both crypto locker and

618
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,559
wannacry important and

619
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960
uh what differentiates them from the

620
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,799
other three pieces of ransomware that

621
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,159
i've covered in the past

622
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,039
and it's really the shift towards

623
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,080
bitcoin or

624
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,120
cryptocurrency in general and we'll talk

625
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,719
about that again in a little bit

626
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,039
so just following the timeline in in

627
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
2018 ransomware

628
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,120
actually took a bit of a dive in terms

629
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,520
of

630
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,760
showing its frequency in the wild

631
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
cryptojacking

632
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,960
ramped up in 2018 so i just wanted to

633
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,919
point that out

634
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,000
just following this i guess parallel

635
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,039
timeline

636
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,679
but now we'll talk about new age

637
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,200
ransomware which is

638
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
i would say in the past two years or so

639
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,320
leading up to

640
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,280
today and we'll talk about some of the

641
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
ttps or techniques tactics and

642
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,159
procedures that

643
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,559
ransomware will take nowadays and how

644
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,280
it's evolved

645
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,080
from um i guess the beginning days of

646
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,400
the

647
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,880
the aids pc cyborg ransomware days

648
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,400
so new age ransomware so the first one i

649
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
want to talk about is the rio ransomware

650
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,640
and if you have been keeping up with

651
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,919
infosec news

652
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,640
you'll see that riock was actually in

653
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,400
the news pretty heavily

654
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,159
for two main stories so one of them

655
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,520
was a ryuk ransomware propagation

656
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,000
that took down the health i.t network of

657
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
the united health services

658
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,600
so that was a big wake-up call to the

659
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
infosec community

660
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
showing that ransomware is a serious

661
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
threat to

662
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,840
the health i.t space it already was a

663
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,400
threat

664
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,280
but having that happen was just a real

665
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
wake-up call

666
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,760
and then um another

667
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,039
instance of rio being used used this was

668
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,120
referenced in one of the earlier

669
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,320
presentations in track three about cci

670
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,280
was the trickbot botnet and they used

671
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,679
the ryok ransomware to help propagate

672
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,799
itself and trickbot was taken down

673
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,360
by both us cyber command and microsoft

674
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
in separate

675
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
uh operations but if you've seen rio

676
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,919
ransomware

677
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,799
that's where um the name has has popped

678
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,120
up

679
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,440
in the past but this specific headline i

680
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,559
wanted to point out that

681
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,159
it targets ics which isn't necessarily a

682
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,440
new technology domain

683
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,720
but um you know it's

684
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,039
targeting critical infrastructure is is

685
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,840
definitely

686
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
what uh malicious actors are starting to

687
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,280
target towards

688
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
and then active directory so active

689
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,559
directory

690
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,760
is an it enterprise solution

691
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,520
for identity and access management

692
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
that's used by

693
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,280
95 percent of enterprise it networks

694
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
nowadays so

695
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,280
again it's a huge target

696
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,360
another unique new ransomware is

697
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
something called pure locker

698
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,279
and it's a piece of ransomware that uses

699
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,840
the pure basic programming language and

700
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
if you aren't familiar with it you know

701
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,440
i really wasn't either before

702
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
diving in to this research and it's a

703
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,240
relatively obscure

704
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
programming language which makes it a

705
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
smart tactic for the

706
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
malicious actors to choose because it

707
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
it's not as likely to be caught

708
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,760
by antivirus or or anti-malware

709
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,440
software suites so a new ransomware will

710
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,000
unuse

711
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,640
unusual tactics indeed and then there's

712
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,919
sodium

713
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,720
or the easier way to say this is re evil

714
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,080
that's the other alias

715
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
and this headline outlines this as the

716
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,679
crown prince of ransomware

717
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
and the last two pure locker and re evil

718
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,760
fall into a ransomware family called

719
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
ransomware as a service

720
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,840
and the way to think about ransomware as

721
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
a service is

722
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,320
a business model to help propagate and

723
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,440
serve off

724
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,679
uh ransomware kits and you you typically

725
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,559
find this

726
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
on the dark web you know there are ton

727
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
of ads scattered all throughout the dark

728
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,919
web just advertising

729
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,720
ras it's similar to a software as a

730
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,600
service

731
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
suite you know think of like your google

732
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,279
suites or

733
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,039
amazon applications in aws

734
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,080
and probably the most desirable feature

735
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,640
of

736
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,240
ransomware as a service is that it's

737
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,880
really really easy to deploy so

738
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,159
you find yourself scouring the dark web

739
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,760
and these vendors will just simply give

740
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,600
it off to you to

741
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,520
essentially click a button and run a

742
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,039
tool and

743
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,640
you know a script baby script kitty

744
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
could essentially just run it

745
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,279
uh with no technical knowledge

746
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,200
so these are some of the the screenshots

747
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,520
of you know potential ransomware's

748
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
ransomware as a service vendors that

749
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
you'll find across the dark web and

750
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,120
again i i don't recommend

751
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
scouring the dark web um without the the

752
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,400
proper

753
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,279
safety protocols and proper operational

754
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,000
security

755
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
and there are other talks that are like

756
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
there are other talks in content that

757
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
talk about

758
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
what to do with that so definitely

759
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,760
recommend checking those out

760
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,039
but these are some of the screenshots

761
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,840
that you'll see for offering ransomware

762
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,480
as a service

763
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,559
so like i mentioned before

764
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,360
cryptocurrency decided to take a switch

765
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,159
towards

766
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,120
towards bitcoin and an important thing

767
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,080
to also

768
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,200
um i guess track is that re evil

769
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
one of the ransomware uh being deployed

770
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
from a ransomware as a service suite is

771
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,279
that they decided to take a switch from

772
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,000
bitcoin to monero and if you're not

773
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,360
familiar with monero

774
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,159
it's another piece of cryptocurrency

775
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:20,880
that's more

776
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,480
focused on privacy and anonymity

777
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,440
and we'll talk about that a little more

778
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,840
with

779
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
this pseudo demo and really these are

780
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
just screenshots that

781
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,600
i've put here in the slide but first off

782
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,360
we're going to cover collecting open

783
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,960
source intelligence on

784
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
the blockchain network specifically with

785
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,400
bitcoin and like i mentioned

786
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,640
before blockchain is inherently

787
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
transparent and you're able to

788
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,440
track historical data all throughout the

789
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
blockchain's history

790
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,120
so this is a website called

791
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,159
blockchain.info or you could just look

792
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,200
up blockchain

793
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
explorer on google or your preferred

794
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,799
search engine

795
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,480
and you'll be brought to this page and

796
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,880
it'll pop up with a ton of

797
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,360
unconfirmed transactions and the hash

798
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
value of those transactions

799
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,840
so on a blockchain transactions are

800
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,039
associated with

801
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,640
with hash values so clicking on that

802
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,520
first

803
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
unconfirmed hash value for that

804
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,559
transaction we'll see that

805
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,559
there is a bitcoin address that is

806
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,320
sending a certain amount of bitcoin to

807
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,840
another bitcoin address

808
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,080
so if we were to follow the money trail

809
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,440
by clicking on

810
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
the sender's bitcoin address it'll give

811
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
us a little more information

812
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,320
in terms of their transaction history so

813
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,039
you'll see that

814
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,520
it's participated in two transactions

815
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,480
the amount of

816
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,960
total bitcoin they've received and the

817
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,520
amount of

818
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,600
bitcoin that they've also sent and um

819
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,120
identically they're the same

820
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,840
amount so you could assume that this

821
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,039
address was just used

822
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,240
as some kind of proxy address to um

823
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,399
follow down a money trail and that's

824
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,760
definitely what you can do

825
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,399
by just clicking on these different hash

826
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,000
values for the transactions or

827
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,799
the bitcoin addresses that are outgoing

828
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,760
from this

829
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,320
initial starting point so what if i want

830
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
to find out more information about this

831
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,000
bitcoin address so there's another

832
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
resource you can use called bitcoin

833
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,279
who's who

834
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,360
and it's a really great resource to

835
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
gather any more

836
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,120
investigative leads or any additional

837
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,240
information about

838
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,399
who potentially is operating behind this

839
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,520
bitcoin address

840
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
and probably the key feature of bitcoin

841
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,880
who's who

842
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,279
is their scam alert feature so it'll

843
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,440
prompt and encourage users

844
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
who use this website to report bitcoin

845
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,760
addresses that have been involved in

846
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,240
fraudulent actions or some kind of scam

847
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,960
in the past

848
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,399
and you'll see some of the scam reports

849
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,120
on that right hand side there

850
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,679
so diving in a little deeper into this

851
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,960
bitcoin address

852
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,919
um we'll see that it is associated with

853
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,559
some kind of

854
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,960
bitcoin wallet blockchain wallet um

855
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,080
that's essentially where

856
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,760
a user will hold their cryptocurrencies

857
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,679
again you'll see that it's participated

858
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,120
in two transactions

859
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,559
a date for their first and last

860
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,640
transactions and the total amount

861
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,840
received in bitcoin translated to us

862
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
dollars fiat currency

863
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
and you'll see that there's also an

864
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
output output a transaction of one

865
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,240
um so this doesn't really give us that

866
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,679
much more information from

867
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,480
blockchain explorer but given that some

868
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,320
of these other fields are populated like

869
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
last transaction ip address and you

870
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,440
could probably assume

871
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
that this address was used through some

872
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,240
kind of vpn or

873
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,120
proxy service to help obfuscate the

874
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,159
actual location

875
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,919
that's why the ip address wasn't showing

876
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,760
there are other instances where

877
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,559
bitcoin addresses and ip addresses are

878
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,200
cross-correlated

879
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,000
so let's take a a bit of a more modern

880
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,720
approach

881
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
and use case and if you um

882
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,559
in the audience remember there was an

883
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,320
instance back in july where

884
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,880
uh former pr user former us president

885
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,080
barack obama

886
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
uh offered to double your your bitcoin

887
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,279
if you or

888
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,200
double your money if you sent it to this

889
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,880
specific bitcoin address

890
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
and there are a ton of people who are

891
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
excited to participate and

892
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,200
you know who we couldn't not trust our

893
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,399
former us president

894
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,480
and no lo and behold this actually

895
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,120
turned out to be twitter bitcoin scam

896
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,679
probably the most high profile uh

897
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,720
twitter scam in

898
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,200
history and a ton of other accounts were

899
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,320
overtaken like

900
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,760
elon musk i'm blanking on everyone else

901
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,799
but i think uh

902
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,200
think of every high profile celebrity

903
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,399
they're probably involved

904
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,520
in this bitcoin scam at some point so

905
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,720
just based on what i

906
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,039
gave you um in terms of following the

907
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,840
money trail

908
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,679
that's something we could very much do

909
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,760
with this bitcoin address and

910
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,919
our twitter hackers were so generous

911
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,360
enough to

912
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,039
provide us with this specific bitcoin

913
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,600
address so if we do the same thing

914
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,880
we take a look at the amount of

915
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,559
transactions and we see that there's

916
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,360
actually

917
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,600
a ton of transactions who are a ton of

918
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,559
people who fell

919
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,000
for this bitcoin scam 400 transactions

920
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,559
and if we try to follow the money trail

921
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,720
a little bit more

922
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,440
uh we could see this bitcoin address

923
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,240
sending out

924
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
a certain amount of bitcoin to a bunch

925
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,360
of other addresses

926
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,840
and like i mentioned before you could

927
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,279
follow down the money trail

928
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,159
but without a proper workflow proper

929
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,039
methodology

930
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,760
to searching for you know the money

931
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
trail whether it be with bitcoin or

932
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
or any kind of financial transaction

933
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,679
that you're trying to trying to follow

934
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,159
it's very easy to get deadlocked run

935
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,200
into a dead end

936
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,679
and just get lost you know especially

937
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,200
because a lot of these bitcoin addresses

938
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,399
are just random

939
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,159
um random values that have no

940
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,039
uh i guess sentimental value at at face

941
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,679
value

942
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,640
so just um if you decide to do some osun

943
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,039
on

944
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,799
um you know malicious bitcoin address or

945
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,399
blockchain address just keep that in

946
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:54,880
mind

947
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,480
and um yeah just uh

948
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,880
keep your your proper information on

949
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,760
like a piece of paper or something

950
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,159
so after that following the money trail

951
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,240
we could go back to bitcoin

952
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,799
and see if that bitcoin address was

953
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,480
associated with some kind of scam

954
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,559
and pasting in that twitter bitcoin

955
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,399
address you'll notice that the address

956
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,320
report here is actually different from

957
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,679
the twitter bitcoin scam and the reason

958
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,000
that is is because bitcoin husu was able

959
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,320
to

960
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,360
cross-correlate a scam happening with

961
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
the address on screen

962
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
with the twitter bitcoin scam and that's

963
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
because of the fraud reports that

964
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,080
encourages its users to

965
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,120
uh to submit so this is actually a great

966
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,559
investigative lead point for all my osun

967
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,840
investigators all my criminal

968
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,679
investigators cti analysts

969
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,760
and it gives us a lot of information so

970
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,000
the first transaction actually happened

971
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,200
long before the twitter bitcoin scam

972
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,840
even happened and it even gives us an ip

973
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,960
address so

974
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
provides us with a lot of leads to to go

975
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,880
down a certain rabbit hole and

976
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,799
try to collect information on this

977
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,600
malicious actor

978
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,399
so if you type in the twitter bitcoin

979
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,679
address specifically

980
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,120
it won't return any information and

981
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,360
that's because of a sing tactical

982
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,880
syn tactical issue within bitcoin who's

983
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,640
who they're unable to process

984
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,360
uh bitcoin addresses that have the bc1

985
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
prefix

986
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,840
i think that's a feature that work that

987
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,679
they're working on but

988
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,120
a little difficult for for them to track

989
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,039
so i mentioned bitcoin versus monero and

990
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,559
monero essentially being

991
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,480
a privacy coin and we're gonna talk

992
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
about what what makes monero a privacy

993
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,840
coin and

994
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
that much more confidential than than

995
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,200
bitcoin

996
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
so following the same kind of

997
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,960
methodology that we did with our

998
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,919
bitcoin money trail tracking we could go

999
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:46,720
to

1000
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,919
the monero blocks info website and we

1001
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:50,799
could also follow

1002
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,679
down you know the same kind of rabbit

1003
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,159
hole

1004
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,039
of tracking tracking the money so if we

1005
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:57,519
do that

1006
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,640
we click and select on a specific hash

1007
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
value that happen on the monero network

1008
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,360
it'll show that it's participated in uh

1009
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,960
about seven transactions for this

1010
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,399
specific hash value

1011
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,119
and this hash value is associated with a

1012
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,199
cryptocurrency exchange called coinbase

1013
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,639
where you can exchange different kinds

1014
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,918
of cryptocurrencies

1015
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,239
not just monero not not just uh not just

1016
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,199
bitcoin

1017
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,040
so again clicking down on the money

1018
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,719
trail we're gonna click on that first

1019
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,119
transaction hash

1020
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,359
and this brings us to a page that really

1021
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,800
doesn't give us that much

1022
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,040
more information just tells us that the

1023
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,839
output total is

1024
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,960
confidential and the inputs and outputs

1025
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,280
boxes don't really give us that much

1026
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,159
more information

1027
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,440
other than a public key so

1028
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,079
other than what this monaro blockchain

1029
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,839
explorer is telling us

1030
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,599
is confidential what actually

1031
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,040
contributes to

1032
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,520
the privacy and anonymity features of

1033
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,839
making monero

1034
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,240
monero transactions confidential and

1035
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,200
fundamentally

1036
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,920
what makes it a privacy coin so there

1037
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
are some key

1038
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,599
features of monero that contribute to

1039
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,640
this

1040
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,520
the first two are stealth addresses so

1041
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,079
each

1042
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,200
monero transaction is associated with

1043
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,960
only a one-time address whereas a

1044
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,560
bitcoin address

1045
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
is a dedicated address that you send

1046
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,599
money to

1047
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,000
so from an outside perspective a

1048
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,800
transaction

1049
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,440
between two monero addresses quote

1050
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,079
unquote

1051
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,720
will be one-time addresses every time

1052
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
and that falls into the second point of

1053
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
ring confidential transactions which is

1054
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,920
based off a cryptographic protocol

1055
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,240
or a form of cryptography called ring

1056
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,119
signatures

1057
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,800
and the way it's applied in monero is

1058
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,119
that you know even if you were able to

1059
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,040
get your hands on some kind of outside

1060
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,240
perspective of the

1061
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,560
the funds being transferred um that's

1062
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,320
not the legitimate value of

1063
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,359
what's being transferred within the

1064
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,520
monero network because ring ct

1065
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,880
will throw in randomized funds so that

1066
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,200
an outside person couldn't sniff the

1067
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,040
legitimate value of these

1068
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,680
um of the transaction happening between

1069
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,400
uh the two

1070
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,560
people on the monero network and in

1071
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,800
cauvery or cavry i'm not exactly sure if

1072
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
i'm pronouncing that correctly

1073
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
um it's an active development feature

1074
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,119
from the monero

1075
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,560
uh team that they're trying to

1076
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,880
incorporate incorporate uh technology

1077
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,960
similar to the tor network which is used

1078
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,520
to

1079
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,320
um help anonymize yourself on the dark

1080
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,960
web

1081
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
and access the dark web in general

1082
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,320
through something called onion routing

1083
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,079
so kovari is using some

1084
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,119
technology very similar to that so those

1085
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,320
are some of the key traits

1086
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,200
of what makes monero a confidential

1087
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,240
privacy coin

1088
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,359
that makes it much more secure from a

1089
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,000
privacy

1090
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,560
standpoint than something like bitcoin

1091
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,359
and there are

1092
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,480
i will caveat that by saying bitcoin can

1093
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,240
be secure there are features that you

1094
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,800
can

1095
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,440
uh customize and implement on your own

1096
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,359
accord that will make it more secure

1097
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,839
but fundamentally monero at its core is

1098
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,480
a privacy coin

1099
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,280
so another quick use case so the us

1100
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,720
department of treasury operates

1101
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,200
something

1102
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
called the office of foreign asset

1103
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,400
controls and

1104
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,720
specially designated nationals list so

1105
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,920
these are

1106
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,000
potential threats in terms of the

1107
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,440
financial world to

1108
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,400
the us and you know it will keep

1109
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,599
information on their names

1110
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,119
email addresses and financial

1111
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,720
transactions that they've

1112
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,680
participated in the past and in this

1113
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,480
specific list

1114
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,320
it it says it marks a monero address

1115
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
but if you look a little closer and we

1116
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,359
continue to conduct our open source

1117
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,720
intelligence collect open source

1118
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,839
intelligence

1119
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,520
looking at the monero blockchain

1120
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,320
explorer this is actually a payment id

1121
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,720
so it's not a monero address a payment

1122
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,320
id is an arbitrary value that's given to

1123
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,480
some kind of monero transaction from

1124
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,880
a cryptocurrency exchange so it's really

1125
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,640
just some kind of tag

1126
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,599
and to give the treasury department the

1127
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,480
benefit of the doubt

1128
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,839
this is probably the most information

1129
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,680
they're able to to pull

1130
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,400
from their investigation but essentially

1131
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,480
sanctioning this payment id

1132
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,280
doesn't do anything and to be to give

1133
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,720
credit to monero

1134
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,200
that just really speaks volumes to how

1135
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,320
important privacy

1136
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,280
and security is to uh the monaro

1137
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,520
technology

1138
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,160
so why does this all matter and we we

1139
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,920
always have to have a lessons learned

1140
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,119
slide at the end of

1141
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,680
uh these presentations but in general

1142
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
you know during this pandemic we're all

1143
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
working remote

1144
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,320
uh at least remote work is heavily

1145
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,280
emphasized and

1146
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,839
it makes us all susceptible um to

1147
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,119
malicious actors

1148
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,040
and cyber criminals who are prowling

1149
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,160
prowling on the web

1150
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,920
trying to exploit some of the vulnerable

1151
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,160
software that we're using so

1152
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,440
i guess uh a specific example was

1153
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,920
when uh covet hit in or i guess began to

1154
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,839
become really dangerous in in march and

1155
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,280
people started to

1156
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,560
move more towards remote work working on

1157
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,119
zoom

1158
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,440
was considered taboo because it was

1159
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
inherently an insecure

1160
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,000
platform um but now all that debacle has

1161
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,960
been solved and

1162
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,560
zoom is actually a pretty secure

1163
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,720
platform so things like that

1164
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,960
are things to consider again cyber crime

1165
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,000
is huge

1166
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,200
um and it's just something you need to

1167
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
be cognizant of

1168
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,880
and then the last point digital currency

1169
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,160
is becoming

1170
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
very very popular not not even just from

1171
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,079
a period of peer stand for it

1172
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,440
point or just a personal standpoint

1173
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,640
um there are certain agencies and

1174
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,920
international

1175
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,240
countries that are already implementing

1176
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,320
blockchain technology as well as digital

1177
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,280
currency

1178
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,920
um into their their own like technology

1179
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,320
stack

1180
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,560
and the one specific example i can think

1181
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,280
of is china implementing the digital

1182
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,920
yuan

1183
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,720
and um you know really emphasizing

1184
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,040
blockchain as a

1185
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,440
pillar for their emerging technologies

1186
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,320
going forward

1187
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,440
so it's hard to say what other

1188
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,839
nation states will follow in terms of

1189
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,200
the digital currency trend

1190
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,599
in the future but just know that it is

1191
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,640
um

1192
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,119
is growing and it's very much emerging

1193
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,000
so i

1194
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,319
definitely recommend to to keep up with

1195
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,839
the cryptocurrency space

1196
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,319
if it is something that interests you

1197
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,119
and before i

1198
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,560
end off this presentation i just wanted

1199
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,960
to plug a few resources that

1200
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,720
i've been reading into a little bit

1201
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,160
listening to and

1202
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,680
the first one is investigating

1203
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,440
cryptocurrencies by nick fernando so

1204
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,920
it's a really good reference book

1205
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,760
uh in terms of a lot of these

1206
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,359
methodologies and techniques that i've

1207
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,000
covered

1208
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,040
um and it takes a much deeper

1209
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,000
and granular look at some of these

1210
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,760
technologies and how to actually

1211
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,599
pull down information from a blockchain

1212
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,800
and understand

1213
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
the different values and fields of

1214
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,800
what's important to an investigator

1215
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,400
so definitely recommend that well i

1216
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,440
should say i recommend all these

1217
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,480
resources

1218
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,560
um the second one is breaking monero

1219
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,240
from the monero research lab so this is

1220
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,440
a video series

1221
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
talking about the privacy and security

1222
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,599
implications of how monero

1223
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,359
has learned what they've learned from

1224
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,960
their mistakes in the past from a

1225
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,240
security perspective

1226
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,400
as well as potential security

1227
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,000
vulnerabilities that they could face

1228
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,640
in the future and highly recommend

1229
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,480
taking a look at it just throwing it on

1230
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,960
you know while you're doing chores it's

1231
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,079
vacuuming

1232
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,920
taking a listen some really interesting

1233
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,240
stuff to to pick from the minds of

1234
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,839
the people who are directly involved in

1235
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,520
creating monero

1236
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,599
and then just from a more general open

1237
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,040
source intelligence

1238
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
um threat intel perspective hunting

1239
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
cyber criminals by vinnie detroit

1240
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,319
is a really great reference guide too in

1241
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,520
terms of

1242
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,280
you know cooking actionable intel for

1243
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,599
hunting down cyber criminals looking at

1244
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,880
specific tools to use

1245
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,839
during your investigation and it's just

1246
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,119
the way it reads

1247
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,800
i guess this is just more of a personal

1248
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,040
anecdote it really is like a story so

1249
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,000
he'll talk about his personal

1250
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,960
experiences

1251
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,720
and again these are all really great

1252
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,400
resources that i recommend

1253
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,240
you guys check out um and these are

1254
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,640
these were like very key in helping my

1255
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,280
my research around around this topic

1256
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,800
thank you so much so that being said um

1257

in um

1265
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,359
