professional by day

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,880
and a dark net researcher by night levy

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,080
focuses on the development

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,159
of tools for dark net ocean and data

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,440
analysis

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
uh they offer training and what the

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,880
darknet is and how to use different

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
access points for ocean investigations

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
and they also volunteer at a number of

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,600

professional um

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
i've worked in incident response and

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,159
threat intelligence

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
and i am a dark knight researcher uh my

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
big focus is on machine learning and

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
artificial intelligence where i

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,439
am creating tools for darknet analysis

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
specifically ambly

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
um if anybody's seen my death con talks

57

volunteering where

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,400
i hope to continue focusing in on

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
shining some light in the dark net

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
so we don't have too long today

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,160
unfortunately

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
um i could talk about the dark net

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
forever i'm sure

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
some people know that and it'll go never

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
it will never end

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
i don't know how to stop it so um

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
instead we're going to narrow it down to

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,120
a few things um

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,080
i'm going to talk about the different

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
layers of the internet just to make sure

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
that we are all on the same page with

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,239
terminology

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,840
and what i mean when i say certain

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
things we'll talk about different dark

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,879
webs

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,000
we'll also talk about some

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
investigations some case studies you

79
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
guys can look up on your own i don't

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
want to dive too deep today and

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,920
waste all of our time or well not waste

82
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
it but take up a lot of it

83
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
and then we're going to talk about how

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
we can help law enforcement a little bit

85
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
which i think a lot of us want to do who

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,120
are at this lovely lovely convention

87
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,159
so without further ado what

88
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
are what is the internet landscape now

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,319
there's

90
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,000
seven ways to sunday that we can talk

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
about the internet landscape we can talk

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
about

93
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,319
how many vlans and lands and lands and

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,840
all those create the internet we can

95
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,959
talk about

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
how many different access nodes there

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
are how many different

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
servers are creating the internet whose

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
computer the cloud is whatever you want

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,239
to talk about

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,920
when i'm talking about the layers of the

102
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,319
internet though whenever anywhere i'm

103
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,360
talking about this

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,239
i am unless otherwise specified talking

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:36,640
about

106
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,080
three high level layers those layers are

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,280
the clear net

108
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
the deep web and the dark net the

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,480
uh we're going to go over each of them

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,560
with some examples today

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
uh i think there's some way to do q a um

112
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,799
at the end so

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,879
if there's anything on these layers that

114
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,400
anyone has questions about because some

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,319
of it may seem a little gray

116
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
please toss them in i love trying to

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
clear this stuff up

118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,400
so we're going to go over a few of these

119
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
layers and then we're going to dive a

120
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,720
little bit deeper into the dark webs

121
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
first the clear net very simple

122
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
definition

123
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
if the clear net or rather if a website

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
can be indexed by google

125
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,399
being duckduckgo or any other search

126
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,279
engine

127
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,160
commonly available then it is considered

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
the clearnet

129
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
it is open to be found and to be crawled

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,040
by crawlers

131
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,560
um you some people may hear the term bot

132
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
not a botnet but a robot a crawler or a

133
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,720
spider

134
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,560
all of these are the same genre of tool

135
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
and if they can go out and freely access

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,880
the website without being impeded

137
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
even if it's only one page of a website

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
which we'll get into on the next slide

139
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,080
that is considered the clear net so you

140
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
can think about um

141
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
the front page of facebook uh most of

142
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,479
reddit

143
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
um the first front page of new york

144
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,400
times

145
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
or your bank

146
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,400
all of these are clearnet sites there

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,720
are

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
areas of that that are not clear now

149
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,120
that you cannot access just by googling

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
for those we're going into the deep web

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,919
the deep web is pretty much everywhere

152
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,520
you're talking there's some level of

153
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,039
communication going on

154
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
whether it's between you and a bank or

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
you and your friends

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,880
most universities that have their own

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
internal portals

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,120
are on a deep web the university page

159
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
may not be but the

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,160
where all your homework goes to get

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
graded and stuff that is deep web

162
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
discord is deep web if you're playing

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
games on steam which you should be

164
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
because

165
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,440
cool things are coming out all the time

166
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
including like

167
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,080
something called worms that i don't know

168
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,400
how to play um

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
that is something that you should you

170
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,919
would be

171
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,639
on a deep web even if it's not steam if

172
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,319
it's world of warcraft

173
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,440
if it's um league of legends any of

174
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,199
those games there is a component

175
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,960
to those where you are talking with

176
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
other characters or other people

177
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
and that is the deep web because it is

178
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
not indexed

179
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,120
um defcon forums defcon forums are cool

180
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,639
because they have a dark

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,360
web portal but they also have a deep web

182
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
portal

183
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
but those are also not if you cannot see

184
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
it without having specified access

185
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,319
usually just an account or a special

186
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,919
link in some cases

187
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,560
then it is considered the deep web now

188
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,840
you may need

189
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
more than that to access something and

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
that can be considered part of the

191
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
darknet

192
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
one gray area is with

193
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,759
professional intranets if you work

194
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,960
somewhere and they have their own

195
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
intranet where you can communicate with

196
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,680
each other

197
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,560
that is usually traditionally considered

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
the deep web

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,319
but once you need like a vpn to access

200
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,039
it

201
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
without not just a login but an actual

202
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,960
vpn ip signature

203
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
then you're getting more close to a dark

204
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,360
net

205
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
speaking of we should talk about what a

206
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,639
darknet is um

207
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
so darknet when i'm talking about the

208
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
darknet i'm not talking about a specific

209
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,000
browser

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
or a specific way to access something or

211
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,759
even a website

212
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,400
i'm talking about the requirement of

213
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,960
needing

214
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,000
specialized software uh specialized

215
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
knowledge including urls

216
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,720
and specialized purpose

217
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,960
in order to get to it um you would need

218
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
different types of urls based on which

219
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,960
dark net you're going to

220
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,280
so when i what i usually do when i'm get

221
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
differentiating these two things

222
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,280
is the dark net is the area of the

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,319
internet

224
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,199
that has to do with these special

225
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,000
privileges

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,879
or special knowledge then you have dark

227
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,520
webs

228
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
which is the access points of the dark

229
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
net what you see on the screen right now

230
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,520
is freenet i2p and tor these are three

231
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
of the most common

232
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
dart nets they're all accessible by

233
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
anyone

234
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
who is able to get to their website at

235
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,160
least um and download the software

236
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,879
now like i mentioned before some portals

237
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,520
um or

238
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,479
intranets for companies or governments

239
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,160
may be considered dark net

240
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
nodes or dark webs but those

241
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,599
are not um something i'm going to talk

242
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
too much about today

243
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,759
what we are going to talk about is these

244
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
three dark webs

245
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
um so i'm going to guess that most

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,279
people who

247
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
are hanging out today to talk about the

248
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,679
dark knight have heard of tor

249
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,360
i think most people at this point who

250
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
are on the internet for

251
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
at least a month have heard about tor

252
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,320
somewhere

253
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
youtube has all the dark net unboxing

254
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,600
videos

255
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
and um you're always hearing about how

256
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,680
evil and bad the dark knight

257
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
is because there's drug busts and

258
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
there's x and there's why

259
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
uh no um that's not actually the case

260
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
when it comes to the darknet there's

261
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
definitely

262
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
bad things that go on there but they go

263
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
on everywhere

264
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,839
um and we'll talk about that in a little

265
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,000
bit

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
but first i wanted to go over briefly

267
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,000
the three main dark webs so

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
like i mentioned most people know tor

269
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
tor has

270
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,959
the best and the biggest in the longest

271
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,440
history mostly because the other two

272
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
that we're going to talk about are

273
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,600
derived from

274
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
tor itself um

275
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,920
sorry so tor

276
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,080
is uh originally was a military project

277
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
specifically for the u.s navy

278
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,680
and it was about the routing system not

279
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
the browser

280
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
tours based off of the onion routing

281
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
system and it's an onion because

282
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,800
similar to ogres it has layers

283
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
um and it just kind of got nicknamed

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
this and it's stuck

285
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,240
so i'm not going to go over bullet point

286
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
by bullet point you can read most of

287
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,560
this

288
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
on the tour project's website and it's a

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,880
fascinating history

290
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
and all of these people have done really

291
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
great work so i don't want to gloss over

292
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,200
that

293
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,519
but we're not here for history lessons

294
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,640
we're here to talk about

295
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,079
darkness stuff so um

296
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,399
do you know that for when it comes to

297
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,440
the onion

298
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,160
router routing system you are working

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,240
with a series of nodes

300
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
those nodes are systems and servers and

301
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
services

302
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,640
globally originally it was just the

303
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
united states

304
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
then germany was awesome and they

305
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
started getting some and now it's all

306
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
over the place

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,279
we've got nodes out of wazoo um

308
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,320
and we've got users too originally

309
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,880
tor was a small base and not that long

310
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,959
ago in the early 2000s

311
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
it wasn't even until 2006 that the tor

312
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
project which manages this service

313
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
actually became a non-profit into what

314
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,079
we know it as today

315
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,720
um and then we started getting the

316
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
bridges which helps us connect to the

317
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
network and then we started getting the

318
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,120
browser

319
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
and once the browser came everything

320
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
opened up now

321
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,600
you can actually go on to the uh to tour

322
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
and it looks like pretty much firefox

323
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
because it's kind of a shell

324
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
um and you can access not only the dark

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
net but the clarinet and it's a lot more

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,839
user friendly than it used to be

327
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
where you were almost terminal locked

328
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
um so like i've mentioned there's a lot

329
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
of relays there's a lot of volunteers

330
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
it's

331
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,839
worldwide which means there's a lot of

332
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,120
traffic to it

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,959
it's not as slow as it used to be but it

334
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,720
is still slow

335
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,000
um and you are able to go on to the dark

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,959
net

337
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,680
and find all sorts of stuff on the tour

338
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
nodes specifically

339
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,839
you can find dread which is almost like

340
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,920
reddit which has all sorts of

341
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,720
information

342
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
just like reddit um you can find

343
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,200
drugs you can find exploitation of

344
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
people you can find doxing

345
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
but you can also find people who are

346
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
reaching out for help

347
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,399
um because they are being harassed

348
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,360
they are being ostracized maybe they're

349
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
being attacked because they're

350
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,360
in a country that isn't giving them any

351
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,959
personal freedom

352
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,040
maybe they're part of a group or a

353
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
minority group or a religious group

354
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
that's being persecuted

355
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,560
the darknet any of them is

356
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
a place where people go to be private

357
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,920
and they can ask for help

358
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
for a variety of things um

359
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,360
taurus specifically personally i got

360
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
into tour and the darknet overall

361
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,680
because i was interested in the way it

362
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,040
was helping people

363
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,240
when they needed to find ways out

364
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
of dangerous situations they were in

365
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,839
countries that maybe were locking down

366
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,600
their freedom of persecuting them

367
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
and so they were asking for assistance

368
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,079
and help to get out of that

369
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,839
later on while i was working in this

370
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
field i started really

371
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
digging into how can we use the dark net

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
to combat human trafficking

373
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
and abuse towards children and everyone

374
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,399
and so that's kind of been my

375
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,399
progression and i started on tour

376
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
but i didn't start with the bad stuff

377
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,760
that we always hear about

378
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
and i really want to emphasize that

379
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
because it's a stereotype that's been

380
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,600
dangerous

381
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,519
in some investigations i've seen people

382
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,279
do

383
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,079
torah is just like anything else it's

384
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,200
got it's good

385
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,959
it's definitely got it's bad um

386
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,600
deriving from that we have

387
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,200
about 65 000 unique onion urls are known

388
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
one of my projects actually was able to

389
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
identify

390
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,920
close to 86 000 web pages in a short

391
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
amount of time

392
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,720
now that doesn't mean it's different

393
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
websites but it does mean that tor

394
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,279
is vast and it's something that keeps

395
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,160
growing

396
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
anyone can spin up a website it's not

397
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,279
that hard

398
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,440
and um it's something that i think

399
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
people should get into more

400
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,720
the more traffic that goes into the tour

401
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
the stronger it becomes

402
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,839
one very important thing to note about

403
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,240
tor

404
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
and anybody who's on it there are v2

405
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,199
urls which are about

406
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,760
16 characters in length they're

407
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,440
scrambled they look like a hash their

408
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,800
letters numbers whatever

409
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,040
no symbols um and they end in that onion

410
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,839
that's fine however those are no longer

411
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,680
going to work in a few months

412
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,320
taur is updating to be three urls which

413
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
about 52 characters in length

414
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,399
usually again looking like a hash but

415
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,920
with numbers and

416
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,839
letters only um and you're going to have

417
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
a real issue if you were doing any kind

418
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,360
of investigation

419
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,079
and all you have are v2 links because

420
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,600
once they're dead you're going to lose

421
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,440
all of your sources

422
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
a lot of websites are giving out their

423
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
v3 urls

424
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
some are only doing it in images just in

425
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,320
case

426
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,279
there are people using tools like

427
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,880
spiders to dry and just grab

428
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,240
the new information and images can be

429
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,040
very dangerous on the dark net

430
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,639
you are more likely to see something

431
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,279
explicit that you may not want to see

432
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,040
so be mindful of this and try to find

433
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
v3 urls where you can there's only a few

434
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,040
months left before

435
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,120
v2s die as far as i'm aware

436
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,720
now moving on to freenet

437
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
um the freenet is a free software

438
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,040
it is also derived off of the onion

439
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
routing system but it's a little bit

440
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,959
different

441
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,920
they use decentralized nodes mostly held

442
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,360
up by people

443
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
um just like the tour nodes are just

444
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
volunteers

445
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,519
uh let's see sorry guys

446
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,720
so this is pretty similar um all of the

447
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
communications are encrypted and routed

448
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,759
through each other

449
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,440
freenet is pretty interesting there's

450
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,000
actually a case going on about freenet

451
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
right now um prenet what happens is when

452
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,320
you're using it

453
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
you're storing your information on your

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,920
own computer and others

455
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,120
so if you are found to be downloading

456
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,680
something

457
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
suspicious and malicious it's not only

458
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
on your system but other systems

459
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,320
and the way that freenet counteracts

460
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,279
this

461
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
is by encrypting that even against you

462
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,360
whoever is owning the computer so you

463
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,959
actually give it a set of storage that's

464
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,480
not just for your data

465
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,759
but for other people in your areas data

466
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
this way you hopefully and it depends on

467
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
the court of law would have some

468
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,600
deniability against what may or may not

469
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,680
be found on your system

470
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,639
but it is another big warning flag about

471
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
the dark net be careful

472
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
because you sometimes especially with

473
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,839
freenet don't actually know what's on

474
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,120
your system

475
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
even if you didn't go anywhere bad

476
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,519
i2p is another one

477
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,480
um this one has a again a similar system

478
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,079
but it's a little it's more based on

479
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,279
tunneling

480
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,160
um they also have irc's which are

481
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
internet relay chats

482
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,920
those are a lot of fun if you've been on

483
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
discord or slack you may

484
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,280
know what the environment kinda is like

485
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,199
depending on your crew

486
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,319
um there's a lot of latency and

487
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,959
throughput but that's on all of these

488
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
um oops

489
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,359
my favorite of the three dark uh webs is

490
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,199
when it comes to the internet name the

491
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,559
url rather is

492
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,959
i2p because they're called eep sites and

493
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,480
i just love that i think it's really

494
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
funny

495
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,400
um freenets are called free sites and

496
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,039
then

497
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
tour is that onion all of them are great

498
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,960
um i'm just breezing through this a

499
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,679
little bit

500
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
because i wanted to talk i realized i

501
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
can talk about this forever and i wanted

502
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,120
to tell you guys some more cool things

503
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
so we're going to move on to ocean

504
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,559
investigations sorry

505
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,600
so you guys are hearing about i'm

506
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,320
sitting all day

507
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
every day especially today because of

508
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
the conference

509
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
but let's talk a little bit about ocean

510
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,080
on the darknet

511
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
um what can we discover through these

512
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
different dark webs

513
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
well why how did we get to the darknet

514
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
to begin with

515
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,520
are we just doing a plain investigation

516
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,880
we're starting at a wiki and

517
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,600
just going you can do that i do that all

518
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,000
the time

519
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
i try to do that almost on a weekly

520
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,520
basis just to keep myself aware of

521
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
what's going on

522
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
um or do you follow a clarinet lead it's

523
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,400
not

524
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
actually as hard to do as some people

525
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
may think darknet websites are

526
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,880
all over the place especially dot on

527
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
insights

528
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,679
we're going to talk about a few places

529
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,840
you can find them in a minute

530
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
now are you hunting for something that's

531
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,520
illegal or are you just hunting for some

532
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,880
information that may or may not be

533
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
illegal

534
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,720
are you trying to identify a nation

535
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
state or

536
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,640
just some political shifts are you just

537
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
trying to find somebody to talk to

538
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,679
because your favorite episode of your

539
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,039
favorite tv show came out and none of

540
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
your friends watch it

541
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,960
there are definitely places on tour to

542
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
do that too um

543
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,120
how do you follow the trail and where do

544
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
you go next

545
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
this is all about knowing your ocean

546
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,200
skills ocean on the clarinet and the

547
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,919
dark net

548
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,799
is not terribly different the big thing

549
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,600
here is

550
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
i knowing what you're looking for and

551
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
knowing when to stop

552
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,760
because the clear net can get dangerous

553
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
you can end up down a rabbit hole that

554
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,080
can

555
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
be full of a list of materials you don't

556
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,200
want to see

557
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
like csam and those all need to be

558
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,640
reported immediately

559
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,200
the road on the dark net when it comes

560
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,840
to ocean

561
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,679
is a lot shorter to catching those

562
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,840
things mostly because

563
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,960
it's almost more open not necessarily

564
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,760
because

565
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
that's all that's on there it's just a

566
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,679
little easier to find

567
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,160
um and so when you do run into those

568
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,000
things you need to know what to do

569
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,679
but before you even get there you need

570
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,280
to know what you're looking for

571
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,520
if i'm looking for malware and i end up

572
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,960
somewhere with that's

573
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
uh just pornography i'm probably in the

574
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
wrong spot

575
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,559
um if i'm looking up malware and i find

576
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,520
something

577
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
about a bunch of torrents and movies i'm

578
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
prob i might not be in the wrong spot

579
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,000
but i've got

580
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,720
to double check and that's the thing

581
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
about this you really need to know where

582
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,440
you're starting from

583
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
and when you're about to pivot into a

584
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,919
different type of investigation

585
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,360
you need to recollect your thoughts and

586
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
think about it make sure this is the

587
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,000
right place

588
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,280
to go so where

589
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,840
on the clear neck can we go to pivot to

590
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
the dark now

591
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,559
uh reddit's number one reddit is great

592
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,919
um you can go to there's about four

593
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,960
different

594
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,400
uh subreddits that are excellent um

595
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,600
r slash tor or slash onion r

596
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,720
slash dark net

597
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,799
and then uh there's some for itp and

598
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,240
freenet too

599
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
and all of them have urls they're banks

600
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
they're full on banks of sites and

601
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,559
uh some of them work and some of them

602
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,640
don't and there's ways to test that

603
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
without actually going to the website

604
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
but you want to be careful some people

605
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,000
are posting things just yet arise

606
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
some people are posting things because

607
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,400
they're actually giving you a

608
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
recommendation on something to buy

609
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
keep this in mind keep in mind the

610
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
reputation of the person

611
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,559
i know for a fact that you can go on

612
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
reddit and find me calling people out

613
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,039
for

614
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,760
lying about what they bought on tour um

615
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,280
because they just took a picture off of

616
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,799
some website and claimed it was their

617
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,280
kitchen

618
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,480
cable um so there's

619
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,159
it's not always trustworthy but there's

620
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,679
definitely things that you can pivot off

621
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,320
of

622
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,520
pastebin constantly has them raidforms

623
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,200
is not a safe for work

624
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,320
website but it is definitely a good site

625
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,679
for data leaks

626
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,480
and um from for some urls for data leaks

627
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,520
for buying for carting things like that

628
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
social media people think that they are

629
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,159
scot-free if they're on the dark net

630
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,000
sometimes they think that nobody can

631
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,880
find me

632
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,360
so here's all of my information to my

633
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,640
marketplace come buy all my stuff

634
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
and they'll give you a url just follow

635
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
that and then make sure you can verify

636
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,520
it

637
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,280
uh forums people talk about this stuff

638
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
all over the place hacker forums

639
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,960
um doc's bin be careful with doc's been

640
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,799
again it's not safe for work and it can

641
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,600
be really

642
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,880
nasty so forth so on they're all over

643
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
the place i've found

644
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,159
onion dot onion urls out in the wild

645
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,159
like on posters on like the corners

646
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,720
stapled into phone calls they're

647
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
literally everywhere

648
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,679
if you just start looking here are some

649
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,720
recommendations for cases to review

650
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
you have the harvard bomb hoax which

651
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,799
happened in 2013

652
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,919
um and you have murder for hire in

653
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
russia there is also a murder for hire

654
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,400
case in the united states

655
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,760
um i cannot pronounce the

656
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,679
lieutenant colonel's name who was

657
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,760
murdered but if anybody has that

658
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,120
question i can provide that

659
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,240
those details later um

660
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
but my main thing i want you to take

661
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,280
away is

662
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,919
where do you start do you start clear

663
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,880
and then go to dark

664
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,159
or do you start dark and then go to

665
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,039
clear and

666
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,440
think about it but know that there's no

667
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
actual right answer

668
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,440
if you are law enforcement or working

669
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
with law enforcement or hoping to hand

670
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,080
over a case to law enforcement

671
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,039
what you really want to focus in on is

672
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,840
okay

673
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,080
i have this person on the dark net that

674
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
i'm investigating

675
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,200
i think they're tied to this person on

676
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,640
the clear net it doesn't matter which

677
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,840
way you started

678
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,080
but can you tie those two together and

679
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,960
how

680
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
and can you write a report and prove

681
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,440
that to law enforcement

682
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,400
if you can do it do it as well as you

683
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,720
can

684
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,559
document everything you made a mistake

685
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
let them know because they're gonna have

686
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,360
to replicate it

687
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,279
and if they can't because the darknet

688
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,760
any of them very volatile

689
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
you want to make sure that they are able

690
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,760
to use your evidence

691
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,880
to prove their case if they've got one

692
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
which brings me to contacting law

693
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
enforcement when you're doing really

694
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,919
intimate yeah sorry when you're doing

695
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,720
investigations

696
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
uh you're gonna come across materials

697
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,000
that you need to turn over

698
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
it's going to happen i can pretty much

699
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,360
guarantee you

700
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,200
you can go on the front page of dread

701
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,520
and find something you want to turn over

702
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,799
um i do not have the list of everybody

703
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,159
to report to globally

704
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,039
i wish i did i will someday collect that

705
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,000
but here is

706
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the two very important links for the

707
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,720
united states and australia

708
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,200
use these and report what you find to

709
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
the right authorities because it is so

710
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,919
important to work with them

711
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,640
and i was mentioned earlier i volunteer

712
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,159
at the innocent lives foundation so i'm

713
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,919
always going to throw them a shout out

714
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,080
if you find any cases that you think the

715
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,679
innocent lives foundation needs to

716
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,880
look at first and foremost

717
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,960
report it to the right authorities

718
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,240
report it to the fbi

719
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,880
or whoever you need to report it to

720
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
because they also need to know

721
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,960
but you can always drop a tip to the ilf

722
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,120
or other similar organizations to help

723
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,919
them

724
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,080
get a start on those investigations so

725
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,919
they can see if law enforcement needs

726
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,720
their help

727
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
or if they can find any more information

728
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
to turn over

729
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,080
well i'm pretty sure i've got like five

730
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,440
minutes left

731
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,159
um and i think i have the ability to

732
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,039
answer questions

733
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,320
i don't know um you do um

734
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,840

736
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,360
