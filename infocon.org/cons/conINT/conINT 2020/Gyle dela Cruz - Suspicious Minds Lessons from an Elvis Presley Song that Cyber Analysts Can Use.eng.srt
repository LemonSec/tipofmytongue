organizations today guys will cover how

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
we can have an investigative mindset

while applying lessons from the field of

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,800
cognitive psychology

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,640
and behavioral sciences to help us

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
become better investigators

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,359

so uh for those of you who may not be

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,159
familiar there's this elvis song

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,320
so there's elvis presley king of rock

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,240
and roll and just to clarify

49
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,880
i'm not an elvis fan exactly my husband

50
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,079
who loves like you know

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,960
uh rock and roll and all those things

52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,759
and one

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,079
and this was like last year when he

54
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,520
played this and then it sort of like

55
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,960
stuck in my mind

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
and and when i whenever i'm like working

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,799
on a case or i'm like you know

58
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,240
responding to an incident

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
or i'm like looking at alarms or alerts

60
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
i actually play it in the background

61
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
and it's because there's like certain

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,040
lines in the song that actually like

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,119
resonates with me in terms of

64
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,360
you know how i should be like keeping an

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,160
open mind

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
so unfortunately due to copyright issues

67
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,239
i can't play the

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,239
music video here or the music but if you

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,080
head over to youtube just search for

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,040
suspicious minds

71
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
make sure that you see this you know uh

72
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,879
cover of the album

73
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,400
yeah so and then i'm not gonna also sing

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
here because i don't wanna

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
you know um sing off tune and or off key

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,720
and then

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
you know basically wrangle up the song

78
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,720
or something but just go through that

79
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,319
it's like quite patchy

80
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,080
okay so basically what would i cover in

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,930
the next uh

82
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,080
[Music]

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
45 minutes or so or 15 minutes or so so

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,519
i'm gonna be

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,319
talking about metacognition you know the

86
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
aspects of metacognition and then i'm

87
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
gonna talk about

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,519
cognitive pitfalls and then what are the

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,280
potential tools that

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,599
you know we can use as analysts in order

91
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
to you know combat you know suspicious

92
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,879
minds okay

93
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,239
so uh i love

94
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
this saying exactly has been attributed

95
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
to different you know writers but i

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
cracked down it was actually thomas they

97
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,760
were who

98
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
uh said something to the effect that

99
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
mines are like parachutes they only

100
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,760
function when open

101
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
so when we're doing analysis or

102
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,680
as analysts we gotta have like uh open

103
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
minds when we

104
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
talk uh when we um focus on a certain

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
investigation

106
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
so i'm gonna be talking about like ha uh

107
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,799
how what are like the different

108
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,040
metacognition stuff that we're gonna be

109
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
you know like that we actually

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
employ without really thinking about it

111
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
and then after that i'm gonna be like

112
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,760
talking about like

113
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,360
cognitive biases now

114
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
uh when we talk about metacognition uh

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
from the name method and cognition it's

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
thinking about thinking it's about

117
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
how uh it's about making sure that we

118
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,319
have

119
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,159
a critical awareness of our you know set

120
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,959
of thinking

121
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,360
or our you know how we think how we

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
analyze and at the same time

123
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,360
about learning so the very fact that

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
you're actually tuned in into this

125
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,360
uh stream or listening to this means

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,239
that you are

127
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,040
actively thinking about how to be you

128
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,959
know better analysts so that's like part

129
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,238
of your metacognition

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,600
and uh part of metacognition includes

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
having that self-awareness as a thinker

132
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:24,960
or

133
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
as a learner like for example by this

134
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
time you may have figured out that

135
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
oh i learned best by doing hands-on

136
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,040
stuff

137
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
or it could be that you found um you

138
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
know you

139
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
realize that oh i'm a type of learner

140
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,240
working

141
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,800
i have to be inside the classroom or in

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,880
i have like a guide a teacher

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
to help me you know with things or it

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,320
could be that now i

145
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,880
learn best by guess you know focusing

146
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
like making sure that i have my own

147
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
quiet time here or my quiet corner here

148
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,040
and i go through like books or it could

149
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
be like i watch videos

150
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
so these all this kind of self-awareness

151
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
comes under the umbrella of

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
metacognition you are

153
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,039
aware of yourself as like a learner and

154
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,240
then there's also like

155
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,759
thinkers like uh and when you talk about

156
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,639
um your self-awareness as a thinker it's

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,520
more of like

158
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,360
uh you understand your biases or like

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
your you know

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
where you're coming from and you

161
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
understand that this

162
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
you know background the background all

163
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
those experiences you had before

164
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
help shape how you make decisions or how

165
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,840
you approach a certain

166
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,880
you know problem okay now

167
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
with that i'm going to be talking about

168
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,600
you know the types of thinking so

169
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
there's like uh for uh cognitive you

170
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
know um

171
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
psychologists there are these different

172
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,160
types of thinking wherein

173
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
they've like you know categorize this so

174
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
one of them the first is like problem

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
solving wherein

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you're presented with a certain issue

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
and you have to come up

178
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,520
with a solution to that so that's a

179
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
problem solving and then after that you

180
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,400
also have like

181
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
decision making which comes under

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
problem solving but decision making

183
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
means you're going to have like a

184
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
particular outcome that's tied to

185
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
uh you know for uh very you know deeply

186
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,919
personal

187
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
outcomes for you and then you have

188
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
judgment where in

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,440
presented with this particular criteria

190
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,800
or you know choices or selection you

191
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
you um you may you pick

192
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
a certain you know um situation or like

193
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
a solution

194
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
but the focus on judgment is that you

195
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,560
are you know

196
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,240
more like deciding on what is accurate

197
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
okay and then we have what is called

198
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,840
uh detective deductive reasoning so this

199
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,400
is what

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,039
uh we generally do when we're doing the

201
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,919
analysis

202
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,000
okay so we're in we have what uh

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
uh we just we have this like general

204
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
then we go into specific

205
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,120
and then you have the inductive

206
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,599
reasoning wherein from specific you go

207
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,479
to general

208
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
and then you have informal reasoning

209
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,520
which a lot of

210
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
us are typically you know this is like

211
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
the type of thinking that we always

212
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,759
apply like

213
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,720
what when we say informal reasoning this

214
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,319
is based on our

215
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,720
past experiences like uh you've

216
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,639
experienced this before and it sort of

217
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,440
like you know

218
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,080
influences you on you know what you're

219
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
gonna be

220
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,199
deciding for this particular scenario

221
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,240
that your face

222
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,680
you're currently facing now

223
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
now so i talk about like um

224
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
the reasoning there so when we talk

225
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
about when we're applying

226
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
reasoning styles into the field of

227
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,000
science

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,319
when you're doing scientific research so

229
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
there are basically three types so i

230
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,639
said like you have deductive reasoning

231
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
wherein you start with a general

232
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,039
statement

233
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,240
or a hypothesis and then you examine

234
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
based on the possibilities to reach a

235
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
certain specific

236
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,479
logical conclusion and so generally this

237
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,199
is like

238
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,360
you're going from a general theory

239
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,199
something theoretical and then you

240
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,479
go to more specific and then we have

241
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
the inductive reasoning wherein you

242
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,520
start from the specific

243
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,000
and then you go to generalizations and

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
then

245
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,720
you basically uh us have a conclusion

246
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
based on the data that you that you see

247
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
and then you have what is called

248
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,800
abductive reasoning wherein

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,280
it is a type of prisoning that doesn't

250
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
fit you know neatly into deductive or

251
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,640
inductive

252
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,440
and it starts typically with incomplete

253
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
observation and it goes into that likely

254
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
likely yes you know group of

255
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,519
observations so

256
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
when you're dealing with let's just say

257
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,800
in the field of like

258
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
uh intelligence if you're gathering you

259
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,399
know uh information

260
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440
data about you know specific let's just

261
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,399
say a goal

262
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,160
you have a particular goal so it could

263
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
be that you're uh

264
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,440
gathering you know open source intel to

265
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
help find missing people or it could be

266
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,760
that

267
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
you are gathering information based on

268
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,000
uh that you're going to be using later

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,399
on

270
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,279
for your uh let's just say red teaming

271
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,240
or you're doing some

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
you know pen testing physical pen

273
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,399
testing so you are basically it's

274
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
possible that you start with very

275
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
incomplete observation and then based on

276
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
what you have found you are able to uh

277
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
deduce that

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
okay this particular um let's just say

279
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,399
missing person

280
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,880
has actually a new life or something or

281
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,760
it could be that

282
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,000
this particular organization they have

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
this you know

284
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,080
users who are always frequently active

285
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,560
in

286
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
social media and they've been like

287
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,640
sharing a lot of their information like

288
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,440
for example

289
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
unknowingly they've taken like focus

290
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
inside their

291
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
you know office and you have like an

292
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
idea of how what is the office layout

293
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,959
which like

294
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,040
going to be very useful if you're doing

295
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,399
like

296
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,519
and testing so now so with objective

297
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,160
reasoning

298
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
uh this is gonna like uh i'm gonna go

299
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
back to the active reasoning later on

300
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
because i'm going to be talking about

301
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,560
one of the tools that we can use to

302
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,920
combat certain you know

303
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,600
cognitive uh issues or cognitive biases

304
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,240
so that that one of that tool is called

305
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
ach analysis of competing hypotheses

306
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,519
which

307
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
uh basically something uh that uses

308
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,680
active reasoning a lot

309
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,800
okay now

310
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
i've been talking about cognitive i

311
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,240
talking about cognitive bias so it's

312
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
more of like you have cognitive you know

313
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
i call this like pitfalls okay so why do

314
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,200
i call them pitfalls because

315
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,279
basically uh these cognitive biases are

316
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
errors mental errors that are caused by

317
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,279
a simplified information processing so

318
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,320
as humans

319
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
we like to keep things simple we need to

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,000
make sure

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
and most of the times we are under

322
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,640
pressure to make decisions or to

323
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,680
come up with you know some judgment and

324
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,079
then

325
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,279
uh in order to quickly you know

326
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,560
get from point a to point b we rely on

327
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,839
certain you know

328
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,839
simplified information processes so

329
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,040
that's our you know

330
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,399
uh the main the main uh challenge here

331
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
and just to clarify uh cognitive bias

332
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
is different from cultural or emotional

333
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,720
bias or cultural like for example

334
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
you have like you grew up in a certain

335
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,959
you know like country or in

336
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
you know without really like pinpointing

337
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,720
and stuff it's like really part of who

338
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,079
you are so you have those

339
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
uh cultural biases but it would be

340
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,519
actually quite

341
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,480
good in terms of uh being an analyst

342
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
that you are aware of like

343
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
where you're coming from so it could be

344
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,320
that you have a preference for a certain

345
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,720
you know

346
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
group of people or it could be that you

347
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
have this uh

348
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,600
emotional bias where if for example you

349
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,240
came from a particular social economic

350
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
background and you know the challenges

351
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,839
facing these people so you have that

352
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,279
emotional biases

353
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
and you have to be careful in making

354
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
sure that those

355
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,120
background biases that you have doesn't

356
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
influence you know what

357
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,680
you're doing in terms of creating you

358
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
know let's just say

359
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,120
uh analytical report like uh intel

360
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,839
reports

361
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
okay so this is something that we have

362
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,279
to be uh

363
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
mindful of now when we talk about

364
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
cognitive biases there's like

365
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
different uh you know terms like uh

366
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,279
terminology that's like used by lay

367
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:27,920
people

368
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,839
and then you have like psychologists now

369
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,200
there is one uh

370
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,959
article from media i'm gonna share the

371
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,320
link later on we're in

372
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
i go back to that because it uh it's

373
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
like a cognitive bias cheat sheet

374
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
so there's like groupings of those

375
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,959
different you know biases

376
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,120
and then there's like links to different

377
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
uh wikipedia or different you know

378
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,720
website in terms of those biases because

379
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,800
uh as an analyst i have to always like

380
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,079
remind myself like

381
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,360
i'm human and i'm i have all these uh

382
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
biases and i have to be very aware of

383
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,839
them sometimes it's not that you know

384
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,320
uh apparent but i have to just keep on

385
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,839
constantly reminding myself so

386
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,880
periodically

387
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,160
i go through that cognitive cheat sheet

388
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,800
website i mean like a medium article and

389
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,040
just read up again on those uh

390
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,920
biases there

391
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,959
now uh when we talk about biases in

392
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,839
terms of

393
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,800
um doing intelligence reports there is

394
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
this group of biases that has been

395
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,880
identified by the writer

396
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,399
of uh the book um the psycho

397
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
psychology of intelligence analysis so

398
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,519
he basically

399
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,560
you know divided you know by biases in

400
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,680
terms of

401
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
groups like for example the first biases

402
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,519
is in terms of

403
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,120
evaluation of evidence when we

404
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,600
evaluate look at the evidence that we

405
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,399
have before

406
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,079
us okay we have certain biases that can

407
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,800
influence

408
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,760
how we perceive the importance or the

409
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,120
relevance of that specific evidence okay

410
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,680
now one of the first one is called

411
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,440
vividness criterion

412
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
okay so what does this basically mean so

413
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
uh when we talk about vividness

414
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,120
criterion this means um it could be

415
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,079
it could manifest itself in terms of the

416
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,639
first

417
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,279
information or let's just say the first

418
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
uh information that we receive

419
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,560
firsthand we will have

420
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
we will allocate or assign you know

421
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,000
value on information that we have

422
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,519
received firsthand

423
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,399
versus let's just say you heard it's a

424
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,680
secondhand

425
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,639
information so we always try to make

426
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,360
sure that

427
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,959
when we receive uh information we are

428
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
able to verify that and that's why like

429
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
you know receiving it firsthand

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
okay yeah you've seen it with your own

431
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,160
eyes okay you've specifically heard that

432
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,279
conversation

433
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,720
that will have you know a higher impact

434
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,880
compared to something like a second hand

435
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
like you know you read the report

436
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
from someone from another analyst but

437
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,240
you gotta like think of it because it's

438
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
possible that it could be a secondhand

439
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,839
information but

440
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,399
there is more evidence presented there

441
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,800
so the challenge here is that this could

442
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,240
potentially

443
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,199
what is called anchoring bias so you may

444
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
have like received this information

445
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,079
firsthand it's so

446
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,959
vivid to you and you anchor everything

447
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
like all those hypothesis

448
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,759
the hypothesis you created you basically

449
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,360
amper there

450
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,320
now it's also possible that in terms of

451
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,800
you know

452
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,440
previous cases that you work in or it

453
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
could be that

454
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,040
you have this particular anecdote this

455
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
will have a greater

456
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
impact and compared to let's just say

457
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
abstract or statistical data

458
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
now uh i'd like to highlight that

459
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
this particular you know difference

460
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,759
let's say

461
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,800
more like anecdotal versus statistical

462
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,399
data or abstract data

463
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,600
it's also driven by your you know your

464
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,079
thinking style so it could be that you

465
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,320
are more like mathematically inclined

466
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,399
so you would prefer like to look at the

467
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,839
numbers okay so

468
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
for you that will be you know uh that

469
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
will have greater impact

470
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,839
but others it could be that in terms of

471
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,680
um uh their thinking style

472
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,160
they more like rely on let's just say

473
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,959
narrative

474
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,920
you know stories all those things so so

475
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
that this particular part second part

476
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
about vividness criterion is that

477
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,680
uh this could also be influenced in

478
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,959
terms of what your

479
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,600
uh you know thinking style or your

480
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
processing the way you process

481
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,560
information now under this a you you

482
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,519
potentially

483
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,920
can have what is called a confirmation

484
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
bias

485
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,839
meaning uh you see something and it

486
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,320
confirms your own personal belief so

487
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
you allocate you know greater value from

488
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,680
that

489
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,360
that that source of uh information that

490
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
you got this

491
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
or and then you have what is called a

492
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
con congruence bias so this

493
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,520
basically this means you over rely on

494
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
your first hypothesis this is

495
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,079
you know a subset of confirmation bias

496
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,000
now there are also other

497
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
biases in terms of evaluating evidence

498
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,199
so

499
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,079
it could be that uh compared to a

500
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,480
situation wherein you have a lot of

501
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,720
evidence you now have what is called

502
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
absence of evidence

503
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
so the issue here is that the

504
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
information is lacking

505
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
and then the challenge here as analysts

506
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,280
is that when we start our

507
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
let's just say our information gathering

508
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,320
we have to factor in the possibility

509
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,960
that

510
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
there is some missing information or we

511
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,240
will or

512
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
potentially we don't get the bigger

513
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,280
picture so we need to make sure that

514
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,840
we factor that in our calculations and

515
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,919
figure out whether the absence of

516
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,039
information is normal for that situation

517
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,520
or it could be that there's an indicator

518
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
that there's something

519
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,280
you know unusual about this about this

520
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,799
uh inactivity

521
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,919
now i'll just hear an anecdote from work

522
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,360
so there's like

523
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
we have a particular tool that we use

524
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,919
and then it's like part of our so i um

525
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,120
by the way i work in an mssp environment

526
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,000
so i work as a soft analyst and then i

527
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,480
also

528
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,039
didn't respond so the part of my

529
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,880
day-to-day work is actually

530
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,799
like you know looking at the different

531
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
tools that we have if there's any alarms

532
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
you know investigating them you know uh

533
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,559
you know figuring out

534
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,919
oh is this really like you know um

535
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,880
through positive or

536
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,960
false positive among other things and

537
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
then a little part of our

538
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
of the job it also involves threat

539
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
handing down going back to absence of

540
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,919
evidence so

541
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
there was one time that was like a month

542
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
ago where for that particular customer i

543
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,080
know

544
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,919
that every day there's always going to

545
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,760
be these signals there's you know

546
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
a little bit of the alarms and one day i

547
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
open up my console to look at that

548
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
particular client set up and look at the

549
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,160
quality like

550
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
oh that's kind of unusual how come

551
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,360
there's no alarm then

552
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,400
i went it was uh it was a monday morning

553
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,720
and then like okay let's see you know

554
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,440
what happened

555
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,760
like it could be like you know um it's

556
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,799
still you know

557
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,200
uh quiet there not a lot of activities

558
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
being seen by this particular tool in

559
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,080
the network

560
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
and went on weekend and okay let's also

561
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,360
add there's like

562
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
no activities and finally what i did was

563
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,520
i i went from the analyst console to the

564
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
admin console

565
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
and look at whether there's actually

566
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,919
traffic flowing through and then there

567
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,360
was nothing there

568
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
so what i did was that i immediately

569
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
like called up the customer's turn it

570
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
turned out that during the weekend they

571
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,600
had uh

572
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
some you know upgrade to their firewall

573
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
so potentially there were some firewall

574
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
rules there that block

575
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,320
traffic to the sensors of the tool that

576
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,280
we use

577
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
so in that case so you have that absence

578
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,320
of evidence

579
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
so knowing that oh there's like

580
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
supposedly like you know some alarms

581
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
there and it's not showing up there's

582
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,480
something wrong

583
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,600
okay now another bias in terms of

584
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
evaluation of evidence

585
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
is over sensitivity to consistency

586
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,159
so we basically um look at

587
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,720
uh think of it this kind of bias is more

588
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,679
of like

589
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
um the information looks consistent

590
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,039
because it's uh there's a lot of like

591
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,720
redundant sources

592
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,120
okay so as an analyst if there's like

593
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
this consistency just because there's

594
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,280
like

595
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
a lot of those redundant you know

596
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,200
sources or reports maybe you can just

597
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
consolidate it

598
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,039
into one report or it's also possible

599
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,760
that

600
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,520
the um information that you're seeing

601
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,799
is consistent because the information is

602
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,600
drawn from a very small sample

603
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,159
or it's a buy a sample so for example

604
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
you see that you keep on seeing like uh

605
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,159
for example if

606
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,200
you deal with the trace labs you know

607
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,039
activities search party activities and

608
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,400
all those things and you see

609
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
is you know and you're doing your

610
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,880
research your awesome gathering and you

611
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
keep on seeing the same

612
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,679
piece of information it's possible that

613
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,440
that this information is just being

614
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,080
repeated because there's just a small

615
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,120
you know uh sample let's just say that

616
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,159
particular person

617
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,640
is coming in from uh like a different

618
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
background wherein there's not a lot of

619
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,120
sharing

620
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
online and you don't see a lack of

621
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,159
information

622
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,720
now what you need to do as an analyst is

623
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,919
to figure out

624
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,320
how representative is this evidence

625
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,720
compared to the total body of the

626
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,960
potential available information that you

627
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,840
have there

628
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
now if that is the case is that you have

629
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
a very small sample size so when you're

630
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
creating your report

631
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,480
in terms of the confidence level just

632
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,880
you know give like a lower confidence

633
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,120
confidence level for that now okay

634
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,919
now so i'm gonna go now to the biases in

635
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,640
terms of

636
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,799
perception of cause and effect um

637
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,679
as humans we have this tendency to rely

638
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,000
on

639
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,159
coastal explanation uh we need to have

640
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,280
this um idea of imposing

641
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,600
order in an environment trying to

642
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,480
understand

643
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
things finding causes or let's just say

644
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,679
things that happens randomly so

645
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,000
so as humans we try to like have this

646
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
like some sort of like cause and effect

647
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
so i'll give you this example okay so

648
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
there's bf skinner okay um

649
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
probably a lot of you are familiar with

650
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,360
another psychologist

651
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,799
i like pavlov and his dogs pavlovian

652
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,159
conditioning were in pavlov was able to

653
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,919
uh condition the dogs to associate

654
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,480
food with the ringing of the bell i saw

655
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
every time i guess before

656
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,880
the dogs are being fed there's going to

657
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
be like a bell and then afterwards

658
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,400
uh whenever the dog hears a bell they

659
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,159
start salivating so you have what is

660
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:00,720
called that

661
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,320
pablobian conditioning which is

662
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
classical conditioning

663
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,600
now there is another psychologist named

664
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
bf skillers were in

665
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,080
he basically worked with pigeons and in

666
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
this case the situation is that

667
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,280
in his experiments the pigeons uh

668
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,840
skinner's pigeons have to pick certain

669
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,880
order

670
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
before they're rewarded uh with food

671
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
and so what happened is that these

672
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,240
pigeons followed an

673
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,440
order of pecking even though later on

674
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,240
they're not

675
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,960
rewarded you know with food so they

676
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,360
still

677
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,000
kept on pecking and this is what skinner

678
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,559
called

679
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,840
the um superstitious or the suspect

680
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,600
superstitions of the pigeons they

681
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,440
believe that if they peg in the same

682
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,320
order

683
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400
as before when they got rewarded they

684
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
will get the reward so basically

685
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,000
this is uh you know uh you have pigeons

686
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
having this like cause and effect

687
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,039
okay now um as analysts we have to

688
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,840
become comfortable with the idea that

689
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
there is a possibility that this

690
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,679
particular event that happened

691
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
has no causal explanation so we have to

692
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
be comfortable with that

693
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,679
okay now the other bias is in terms of

694
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,159
uh the causes of behavior you know

695
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,400
internal you know factors external

696
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,279
factors

697
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,760
so basically as humans we always

698
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
overestimate the role of internal

699
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,520
factors so it could be like

700
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,840
a personality of the person you describe

701
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
like oh the person

702
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,480
did this because they are like this so

703
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,799
it's

704
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,200
more of like the internal factors and

705
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
then we underestimate

706
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,760
the role of external factors in

707
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,679
producing that kind of behavior

708
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,559
so as analysts we have to also think of

709
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
not just potential internal factors when

710
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,080
we're trying to

711
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,320
um let's just say um try to figure out

712
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,080
what's going to be the next step we have

713
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,559
to also look at the external factors

714
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,360
affecting those

715
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
individuals

716
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,080
now another setup or group of biases

717
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
is in terms of estimating probabilities

718
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
okay so one of the biases under this is

719
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,360
what is called availability

720
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,960
bias wherein we have this uh

721
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,000
probability or we uh

722
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,960
estimate the probability of something

723
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
happening or an event happening

724
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,080
on how easily we can recall it and we

725
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,960
weigh our judgment based on more recent

726
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
information so this is what is called

727
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
availability

728
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
bias so for example it could be that

729
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
there has been these

730
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,080
recent events that were in the news and

731
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,240
or let's just say the classic thing like

732
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,279
i remember

733
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,720
like years ago when the uh

734
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,520
the report the apt-1 report from mangan

735
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,400
came out

736
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,799
so it's sort of like basically everybody

737
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,880
started using like the word ap

738
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,279
advanced persistent threats so you have

739
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,320
like you know

740
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
certain you know organizations were in

741
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,919
oh you know something happened and they

742
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:04,799
immediately think

743
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,120
oh it's an ept and all those things so

744
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
it's just because of that

745
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,120
you know uh information that became you

746
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880
know uh that was released and

747
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,200
everybody's like using this you know apt

748
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
terminology and they immediately jump

749
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,840
into

750
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,640
okay we have like an apt group but we

751
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,919
can't really say that

752
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,760
we have been targeted by a particular

753
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,440
group you're gonna have the evidence

754
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,720
there before you

755
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,919
so as analysts we must recognize that

756
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,080
this rule of thumb the availability rule

757
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
of thumb uh is often

758
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,279
um used to make judgment about the

759
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,200
likelihood or frequency so

760
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,679
it is normal that you know you fall into

761
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,000
hell to having this bias because

762
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,799
you are being asked to you know decide

763
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
on the likelihood of an event happening

764
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,799
or the frequency of the event happening

765
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
but you got to be careful

766
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,159
make sure that you have gathered your

767
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
your evidence okay

768
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,320
now the other uh kind of bias here is

769
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,960
called

770
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,080
the anchoring bias so i kind of like

771
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
touch on it earlier where it

772
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,760
uh your starting point is reach based on

773
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
your previous you know let's just say

774
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,600
report your work with this or it could

775
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,679
be like as an analyst or you've heard it

776
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,279
from a previous analyst

777
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,320
and then based on the information that

778
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,840
you've gathered you've anchored

779
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,960
everything there

780
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,600
and then you adjust things based on

781
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
additional information

782
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
analysis that you but you still base

783
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
that on that first set of

784
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
information that got okay now

785
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,840
uh you just gotta be aware that it could

786
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,480
be that

787
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,000
when you are dealing with uh your

788
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
hypothesis that it could be that you are

789
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,679
being driven because you

790
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,159
anchored it in the previous you know set

791
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,679
of ideas

792
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,799
now uh how do we um

793
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,840
combat all this you know potential

794
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,640
cognitive pitfalls pitfalls so we have

795
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,679
several

796
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,399
you know uh tools that we could use so

797
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,480
one of my favorite tools is the

798
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
um place is to approach something in

799
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,960
terms of

800
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,159
the scientific method so i have to i

801
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,360
went to a

802
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,080
science school a science high school so

803
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,399
were you know like went to nerd school

804
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,640
so i remember freshman year you know

805
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
science class

806
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,640
uh teacher said okay we're gonna i'm

807
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,720
gonna talk about scientific method okay

808
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,279
so

809
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,200
we were schooled about the scientific

810
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,279
method everything we do we have to

811
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,279
follow this so you have like basically

812
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:33,679
like

813
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,080
you know six steps there so first is

814
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,159
about asking a question

815
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,679
so or or what we call you're formulating

816
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,200
a research plan

817
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,919
so you ask a question you start with a

818
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,320
problem statement or in a situation if

819
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,640
you're

820
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,320
investigating a particular you know

821
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,559
intrusion so you have a question uh

822
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,840
what's an intrusion or it could be that

823
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,279
you were asked by the uh

824
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,919
spicer uh i heard that

825
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,159
there's you know there's this

826
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,320
information about our company that's out

827
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,200
there

828
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,320
so i want you to find out whether you we

829
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,440
have been breached

830
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,640
and if we have been breached uh

831
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
what sort of information has been

832
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,159
exploited okay so

833
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,000
it could be that's a you know direct

834
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,440
thing you're if you're being

835
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,760
uh asked to answer a specific set of

836
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,640
questions

837
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,120
so what do you do you do your research

838
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
so in that particular inclusion scenario

839
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,600
what's going to be the research like so

840
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,799
you could do like

841
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,960
an internal uh you can do like an

842
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,640
external research wherein

843
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,799
you find out whether there's any you

844
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,799
know information about your

845
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,960
clients in the dark web so i believe we

846
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
have like another speaker who's talking

847
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,760
about that

848
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
now it could be that you start with of

849
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,760
course internally you start first in

850
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,159
your

851
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,480
environment okay check you know your

852
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,279
different

853
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,399
uh sources could be like down sources or

854
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:02,880
if you

855
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,200
have let's say other security tools

856
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
there so you start doing that

857
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
okay or it could be that you started

858
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,080
asking a question that oh okay

859
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,399
what is this you encounter an alarm and

860
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,399
you have already eliminated that

861
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,320
it's not a false positive you have to

862
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,039
find out okay is there is there really

863
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,520
is this particular security event so an

864
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,240
event

865
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
is something that you uh that you've

866
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
seen it's an occurrence

867
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,320
and then you're basically asking is this

868
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,279
an incident

869
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,159
incident wherein it's defined as an

870
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,360
event that has

871
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
uh has broken down let's just say the

872
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,840
cia and when i say cia here it's uh

873
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,279
in terms of uh the triad of security

874
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,559
okay so um then

875
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,240
you do your research and then you

876
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,159
formulate the hypothesis now at this

877
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,320
point of the third phase okay

878
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,039
the hypothesis could be just a simple

879
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
you know statement

880
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,760
like um um

881
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,279
it could be as simple as i uh based on

882
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,679
this

883
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,039
uh alert a you've seen like an alert

884
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,640
uh your hypothesis hypothesis is that

885
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,679
the user click on the link and that

886
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,399
started

887
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,320
you know the business email compromise

888
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,399
so you formulate a hypothesis so

889
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,640
remember that a hypothesis is just a

890
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,799
statement that you can either

891
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,600
uh prove or disprove now the interesting

892
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,519
thing here is that typically people will

893
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:29,840
say

894
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,399
i have a theory i have a theory and it's

895
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,279
like very

896
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,360
you know prevalent you watch you know

897
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
even sherlock holmes you know like

898
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,320
different you know

899
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,279
uh tv shows or movies you know they will

900
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,960
always say i have a theory

901
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,679
but uh whenever i hear that like when

902
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,960
i'm watching a movie

903
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,200
i always remember my freshman science

904
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,559
teacher telling us

905
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,200
it is hypothesis you don't have a theory

906
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,600
yet

907
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,559
because theory means you have gone

908
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
through the scientific method and you've

909
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,159
analyze everything

910
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,960
and you have uh come up with this

911
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,000
particular

912
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,440
you know statement uh or that's say like

913
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,679
this this particular conclusion

914
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,240
and you were able to replicate that that

915
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,200
conclusion

916
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,000
is really based on the set of uh

917
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,279
research you know

918
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,080
uh you've done so let's just clarify

919
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
this thing so hypothesis

920
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,640
okay especially since the next that i'm

921
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
going to be talking about actually keeps

922
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,080
on talking about hypothesis the

923
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,120
hypothesis

924
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,440
is just a statement that you could you

925
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,720
know disprove

926
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,279
or you know you could actually improve

927
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,360
okay so that's a hypothesis and then you

928
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,559
do your experiments

929
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,480
okay so this is like the scientific

930
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,080
method so how do we apply

931
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
that in let's just say an introduction

932
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,600
scenario so

933
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,840
we're gonna be like uh think of it it's

934
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,799
more of like

935
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,919
testing okay checking uh the tools that

936
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,120
you have there that

937
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,200
you have those different you know

938
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,960
sources that will enrich

939
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,360
you know your uh let's just say your

940
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,320
report or your

941
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,159
understanding of what has happened and

942
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,440
then you do your

943
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,200
analysis okay so there are different

944
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
tools that you can use to help you

945
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,760
you know analyze you know whether there

946
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,840
was a successful intrusion or let's just

947
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,399
say

948
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,880
uh your hypothesis was that uh there's a

949
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,960
business email compromise because

950
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,159
a user a user got owned

951
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,399
then after that you accept to accept it

952
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,559
like okay based on your hypothesis so

953
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,799
based on the evidence that i'm gathered

954
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,600
okay is this particular you know

955
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,039
hypothesis true so

956
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,720
if it's not you go back to you know

957
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,919
step three reformulate your hypothesis

958
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:38,799
okay and then

959
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,120
reiterate and start you know looking for

960
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,799
other evidence okay

961
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,799
and then you have there like a sub you

962
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,640
know some set there yes published this

963
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,440
is more of like

964
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
in the scientific you know research

965
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,360
community like after you've done your

966
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,519
experiments and your analysis

967
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,399
and if your hypothesis is true then you

968
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,320
publish your work okay and then you

969
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,080
you know you do presentations in other

970
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,679
conferences okay

971
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,320
so this scientific method in terms of

972
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
like step-by-step uh

973
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,079
way of trying to you know uh

974
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,639
prove or disprove your hypothesis is

975
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,560
quite good in terms of

976
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,079
having a logical okay and a rational way

977
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,440
of

978
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,199
going through your investigation

979
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,839
especially if you're a new analyst

980
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,560
so where do you start okay so you have a

981
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,480
hypothesis and then you gather your

982
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,719
evidence this evidence is based on

983
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,199
let's get the dogs okay or you have

984
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,760
literally

985
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,719
the event id so these are the things

986
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,280
that

987
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,679
uh you can use in terms of approaching

988
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,119
your investigation

989
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,320
okay now

990
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,960
there is this tool called ech okay

991
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,079
this is uh something that was uh

992
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,119
proposed

993
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,320
that was in the 90s by richard howard

994
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
okay so basically

995
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,400
this is the identification of called

996
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,800
reasonable

997
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,960
alternatives and and and

998
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,640
based on the alternatives think of this

999
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
alternative as the hypothesis

1000
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,119
uh these hypotheses will have to compete

1001
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,520
for the attention or the favor of the

1002
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,200
analyst and the goal here is to minimize

1003
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,599
any of those cognitive limitations the

1004
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,680
cognitive pitfalls that i've explained

1005
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,640
earlier

1006
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,960
so that the simplest form you have here

1007
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,440
you can use excel

1008
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,680
so you have there on the top you know

1009
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,560
like

1010
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,280
uh the first line there you have h1 h2

1011
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,320
so this is like your

1012
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,800
hypothesis first hypothesis second

1013
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,839
hypothesis

1014
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,160
third hypothesis and it's a fourth and

1015
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,839
then on the first column

1016
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,920
per row you have e one p1e so these are

1017
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,960
your evidence

1018
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,560
that's the first evidence second

1019
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,800
evidence third evidence for evidence

1020
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
confort and spawn and then you have

1021
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,200
their positive minus so these are the

1022
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,240
values assigned by me

1023
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,599
by the analyst okay so this particular

1024
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,240
tool okay will involve collaboration

1025
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
because you're gonna be

1026
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,720
uh uh presenting this to other analysts

1027
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,680
you have to

1028
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,599
be in a collaborative you know

1029
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,040
environment here and

1030
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,760
ask them about okay what are the

1031
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
hypotheses that we can't

1032
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,280
put all those things and then what are

1033
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,440
the evidence that you have gathered so

1034
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,000
far

1035
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
and then they will provide you know they

1036
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,920
will decide in terms of the values that

1037
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,200
they would allocate

1038
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,520
for the intersection of the hypothesis

1039
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,640
and the evidence

1040
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,560
okay so this

1041
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,400
uh this particular um way of

1042
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,079
working uh is also called in the

1043
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,000
field of psychology you have what is

1044
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
called the uh delphi

1045
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,599
method or the delphi approach wherein

1046
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,000
you have the different experts working

1047
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
you will ask them for their opinion so

1048
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
basically this

1049
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,040
particular tool that was proposed by

1050
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,800
richard howard jr

1051
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,040
or something that's like based on a

1052
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,960
cognitive psychology and but here you

1053
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,760
find it

1054
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,839
in such a way so that analysts could

1055
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,280
actually you know

1056
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,839
have a structured approach okay

1057
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,200
okay so

1058
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,320
uh in terms of doing the uh ac nature

1059
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
the analysis of complete

1060
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,240
hypothesis there are several steps it's

1061
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,000
actually quite structured

1062
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,599
and there are different like training

1063
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,839
that basically just focus on

1064
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,480
doing this ach and in fact there's also

1065
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
software that you could actually use

1066
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,359
through this ach but um yeah you can

1067
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,800
actually just use the excel

1068
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
and but you still have you still need

1069
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,839
you know

1070
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,880
analyst to come up with a hypothesis so

1071
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,480
the first is the identification of

1072
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,800
hypothesis or hypothesis

1073
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,040
meaning it's not just one hypothesis it

1074
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,640
could be several

1075
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
and it is good that you have several you

1076
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,480
know hypotheses

1077
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,119
and then second step here is release the

1078
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,119
evidence so you gotta make sure that you

1079
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,560
have those evidence

1080
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
that you have gathered and then the

1081
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,800
third is you put it in the matrix the

1082
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,720
one that i've shown earlier so there's a

1083
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,560
diagnostics you have that particular

1084
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,440
mate

1085
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,359
and as you go through that you keep on

1086
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,960
refining it

1087
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,839
and if there's any inconsistencies that

1088
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,960
you see

1089
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,680
uh you remove them and then after that

1090
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,599
you do your security analysis

1091
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,320
okay so what happens is that based on

1092
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,040
all those

1093
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,560
you know the thing like the plus minus

1094
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,920
and all those things

1095
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,560
so you try to make sure that you refine

1096
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,440
this remove any inconsistencies until

1097
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,960
you come up with the most likely

1098
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,680
hypothesis okay so you report your

1099
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,720
conclusions

1100
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,760
okay based on what you uh analysis

1101
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,119
that you come up with and then uh

1102
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
after reporting your conclusions you

1103
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,720
also have to identify

1104
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
milestones in terms of um

1105
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,920
you have this hypothesis and you

1106
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,839
provided this particular you know

1107
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,000
analysis and it was your conclusion

1108
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,480
and then in the future like you think of

1109
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,640
it like indicators like for example

1110
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,760
you have provided an intel report saying

1111
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,400
that

1112
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,839
this particular group was the one who

1113
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,400
targeted our organization

1114
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,079
and then you look at uh the possibility

1115
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,599
in terms of like are they going to be

1116
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,520
coming back so you look at that

1117
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,160
and then if you are an intel uh analyst

1118
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,520
that is working for let's

1119
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,920
say a vendor or your and and you need to

1120
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,680
provide a report for a particular

1121
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
industry

1122
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,400
then you identify this particular

1123
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,079
milestone but for this particular

1124
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,119
industry we've seen that uh this

1125
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,800
particular group has targeted these

1126
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,880
organizations let's just say north

1127
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,839
america

1128
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,760
and then what's the milestone like

1129
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,119
potentially they're going to be like

1130
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,200
spreading let's just say in europe or

1131
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,440
something so this is all part of that

1132
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,240
ach so it's quite structured and quite

1133
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,400
rigorous because it involves

1134
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,680
not just uh you know intel gathering and

1135
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,119
also involved like having several

1136
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,599
hypotheses there and it involves

1137
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,240
working with different you know analysts

1138
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,880
now lastly i have put here the tool you

1139
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,240
as an analyst

1140
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,800
so as as practitioners in the field

1141
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,040
we are so enamored of like oh we have

1142
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,480
this particular tool

1143
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,319
there's this new tool there's this new

1144
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,920
you know uh technique

1145
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,800
that's all very good that we are aware

1146
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,720
of these tools and techniques

1147
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,520
but once again the most important tool

1148
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,319
that we have

1149
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,040
is our mind the analyst okay so one of

1150
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,160
the things that i

1151
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,839
i have to constantly you know um

1152
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,640
remind myself i have to ground myself i

1153
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,680
have to cultivate

1154
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,920
intellectual humility i have to

1155
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,880
understand that

1156
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,359
i have you know these pitfalls i have

1157
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,000
these

1158
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
biases and then there is like limits to

1159
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,960
my knowledge so it's quite important

1160
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,000
that we always

1161
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
cultivate this intellectual humility and

1162
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,319
in fact there's a

1163
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,839
study shown that uh people who have

1164
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,760
you know greater sense of intellectual

1165
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,880
humility

1166
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,359
has you know a great generalist

1167
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,000
knowledge

1168
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,119
and they are more aware of you know like

1169
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,359
in terms of metacognition of their

1170
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,440
you know learning styles as compared to

1171
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,880
people which doesn't have

1172
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,920
a high level of intellectual humility so

1173
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
first cultivate intellectually melting

1174
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,119
and then

1175
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,680
second is that we gotta be open to the

1176
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,000
very diversity of background and for me

1177
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,960
personally

1178
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
i believe that in terms of like the

1179
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,800
field of infoset

1180
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,280
it should be that it's open to everyone

1181
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,119
as long as you have the interest

1182
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,240
the passion the persistence okay because

1183
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,440
it doesn't matter

1184
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,800
where you're coming from it could be

1185
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,640
that you come from a computer science

1186
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
background that's really good because

1187
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,640
that

1188
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
gives you all the technical background

1189
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,119
needed to immediately jump into a

1190
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,319
particular

1191
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,480
field of intersect or let's just say

1192
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,160
even intel

1193
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,280
but we have people coming in from

1194
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,200
different backgrounds that will actually

1195
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,720
help enrich our

1196
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,400
analysis like for example if you're

1197
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,480
gonna be doing investigation in dark web

1198
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,520
and there are

1199
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,440
languages there that are not you know

1200
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,960
they're they're discussing you know

1201
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,079
let's just say

1202
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,480
owning a particular company and it's not

1203
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
in english okay so you could still use

1204
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,040
you know

1205
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,359
google translators but if you have

1206
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,680
someone who actually knows that

1207
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,920
language you have an analysis of that

1208
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,720
language

1209
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,160
it will be easier because there are

1210
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,760
nuances to the language that

1211
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,400
is not yet adequately captured by you

1212
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,960
know

1213
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,079
machines machine translations so

1214
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,160
there is this need to have you know in a

1215
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,079
group of analysts you have a diversity

1216
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,599
in terms of background

1217
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,760
okay and then you always have to make

1218
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,000
sure i highlighted this before to

1219
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,640
always review your you know your

1220
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,440
personal

1221
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,839
biases so there's that uh cognitive

1222
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,880
biases speech

1223
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
i'll share that you know you can like

1224
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,839
take a photo of that or script out of

1225
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,200
that later that's like

1226
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,280
okay and then as uh analysts

1227
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,400
there there's always a lot of you know

1228
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,640
work out there and sometimes you know

1229
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,480
eight hours is not enough

1230
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,720
but you gotta make sure that we you take

1231
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,000
care of your health

1232
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,920
when i talk about health it's not just

1233
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,240
your you know physical health but also

1234
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,480
your mental health so it could be that

1235
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,960
um right now we can't really do anything

1236
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,839
much about

1237
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,319
like let's just say exercising uh you

1238
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,160
know a lot outside like for example i'm

1239
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,880
in melbourne

1240
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,839
we're still on a lockdown so we have

1241
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:40,560
that

1242
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,640
five kilometer ranges again you can't

1243
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,400
really go out like that far

1244
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,440
so you know try to do something at home

1245
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,640
you know uh to make sure that uh

1246
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,760
you are able to sort of like close off

1247
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
you know like work your work laptop and

1248
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,280
do something else okay

1249
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,079
or it could be that um you are just so

1250
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,319
passionate your your habit is also into

1251
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,079
like decide where you like you know

1252
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,839
after you're done with work you're doing

1253
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,920
your cyber stuff cyber security stuff

1254
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,880
that's also okay

1255
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,119
as long as you make sure that you have

1256
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,280
you know some down time to yourself

1257
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,319
and then once again um

1258
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,359
you know remember the uh song suspicious

1259
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,079
mind so in

1260
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,640
my case it plays in the background i

1261
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,920
actually use the loop

1262
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,319
which gets in the loop it's just like

1263
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,000
and my husband every time he he

1264
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,319
hears that he knows that oh i'm doing

1265
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,160
something you know that's like

1266
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,720
uh i'm thinking of like i'm doing

1267
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,079
something that requires

1268
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,760
you know a lot of analysis but at the

1269
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,920
same time i have like

1270
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
you know my biases that could be

1271
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,520
influencing it so i'm just playing that

1272
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,880
just to remind myself that

1273
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,000
okay don't be suspicious have an open

1274
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,839
mind

1275
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,160
okay now

1276
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,800
so this is the book uh written by

1277
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,920
richard howard

1278
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,560
uh it's

1279
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,359
okay and this particular book the

1280
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,720
psychology of intel

1281
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,119
intelligence analysis it's a very good

1282
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,720
reading it's not that

1283
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,200
you know uh you don't need to have a

1284
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,280
background in psychology or behavioral

1285
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,040
sciences to understand or even

1286
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,720
appreciate it it's quite good

1287
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,560
so this is already out of print you can

1288
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
actually find some you know pdfs out

1289
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
there that's like

1290
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,520
then uh there's that uh research uh this

1291
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,880
is a write-up about

1292
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,119
people with better intellectual humility

1293
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,960
okay so there's that link there

1294
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,359
and then there's the cognitive bias

1295
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,960
cheat sheet that's the second

1296
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,040
bullet point here okay so that's i have

1297
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,119
it like bookmarks quite good

1298
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,040
and then so that's it so these are the

1299
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,319
sources and then

1300
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,560
uh if you have any questions i think i'm

1301
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,480
just like doing quite well on time if

1302
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,119
there's like

1303
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,200
