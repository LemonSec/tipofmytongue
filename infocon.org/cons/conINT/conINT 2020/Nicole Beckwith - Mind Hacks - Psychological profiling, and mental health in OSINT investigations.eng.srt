00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,160
and doing digital forensics for them

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,799
and then i switched over i was actually

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
assigned to be a task force officer

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
for the united states secret service

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
worked for them in digital forensics

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,560
and incident response

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
that was a ton of fun did all kinds of

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,159
cases there

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,479
and then transitioned over almost two

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,759
years ago now

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,479
as a senior cyber intel analyst for ge

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,439
aviation

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,720
which has just been a blast i still am

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
active law enforcement i volunteer

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
i augment the detective section of a

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,159
local police office or police

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,439
office and you know i also get called in

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,000
for missing

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
persons cases wanted fugitives so i get

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,759
to have all kinds of ocean

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
fun um with that and then i also train

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
officers on digital forensics and cyber

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,399
crime

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,880
um so you know i have seen it all

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
so some interesting cases and we're

54
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
going to talk about a few today

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,320
so just a quick disclaimer what i am not

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,840
so we're going to talk about mental

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
health here today

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
i'm not a psychologist i'm not a mental

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
health expert i'm not a doctor

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
and i am not an fbi or any other

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
professional profiler

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
however um you know i have made mistakes

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,680
in my career

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
there are lessons learned um you know

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,440
i've studied

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
human behavior body language voice

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
inflection

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,760
um at length i've taken every known

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
interview and interrogation class that

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
there is out there

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,840
um short of taking the you know cia

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
terrorism tactics and you know

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,040
interrogation

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,640
um you know i am taking most of those

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
so i've had to deal with you know child

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
exploitation rapes

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,800
abuse i was undercover for a bit seen

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
more dead bodies than i

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
you know care to talk about and then

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
you know with all that stuff i've also

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,120
done some really stupid things that i

82
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
look back on now and i'm like i don't

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,480
know how i'm alive

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,000
so um i'm hoping that through all of my

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
experiences that i can

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
you help one of you with that so i'm

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
going to share some of my mistakes some

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,319
of my wins

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
and just hoping that my experience helps

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
so

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
all right what we're going to talk about

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,159
today um you know there

93
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,120
are two things that we need to look at

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
in ocean investigations

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
and one is you know how to get into the

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,599
mind of the person

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
or your subject that you're profiling

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,560
it could be a victim it could be a

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,319
missing person it could be

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,120
you know the bad guy somewhere but how

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,799
to get into their mind

102
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,519
and then the second half of this talk is

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,560
more about

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,879
how to keep those cases and keep those

105
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,080
people out of your

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
mind so that you don't have trauma

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,000
you're not carrying those weights around

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,959
with you

109
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
and how to segment those parts of your

110
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,239
life so

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,519
these are the things that we're going to

112
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,920
get into we are going to discuss a few

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,519
of my cases they do get a little bit

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,720
dark at times

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,680
so i have slides that pop up that give

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,000
you

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,799
you know trigger warnings um so that if

118
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
you want to kind of you know tune out

119
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
during that slide you can

120
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,879
um i don't want to give anybody

121
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
secondary traumatic exposure so i will

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,759
warn you ahead of time

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,960
all right so we are going to talk about

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,080
investigative profiling first and like i

125
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,800
said you know

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
we want to be able to get into the mind

127
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,000
of our subjects

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
so many people when they go into ocean

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,440
investigations

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
they make the fatal error of just

131
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
thinking that oh i just need to find

132
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
this person and they just start digging

133
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
in and looking

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
i really would um encourage you to take

135
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
a step back

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,280
and do a little bit of you know

137
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,240
pre-investigation first

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
um really look at the person that you're

139
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
looking for that you're looking at

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
and look at their psychology look at

141
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
their background

142
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,080
um you try to dig into what

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
a baseline is for these folks um and

144
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
that way when you

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,639
come across something that's abnormal

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,800
you're aware that it's abnormal and you

147
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
know that it might be something to take

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,960
note

149
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
of so um like i said we're going to

150
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,919
discuss briefly how to get

151
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,000
into the mind of your subject

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
now i put psychological profiling in the

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,320
title of this

154
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,600
but we are not fbi profilers we

155
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
do not do this for a living so i like to

156
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,880
call this

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,919
investigative profiling because

158
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,520
you know we're not doing the stuff that

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
those fbi human behavioral analysts are

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
doing

161
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
um so what we want to do is you get

162
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
that baseline so we're looking for in

163
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,080
photos

164
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
um in videos the verbal cues the voice

165
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
inflection

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
um you anything that we can have

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
access to in our ocean investigation

168
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,560
that um might help give those clues now

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
obviously we don't have the luxury of

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,759
everything that an

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,720
agent has or a detective has but we do

172
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
have quite a lot

173
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,759
so the next thing i get asked constantly

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,080
is

175
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,400
why in the world do i want to profile

176
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
that person

177
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
well because sometimes you need to take

178
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
that step backwards

179
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,199
in order to make some strides forwards

180
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,319
like i said you're trying to get that

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,639
baseline so

182
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
on with me for any of my investigations

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
before i even sat down with somebody in

184
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,960
a case

185
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,240
um my suspect i had already done

186
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
a full ascent investigation of their

187
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,360
life

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
i knew their background i knew where

189
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
they lived i knew their family

190
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
i had that baseline and typically

191
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,199
through doing that

192
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,800
investigation i even had a motive

193
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,039
as to why they conducted whatever crime

194
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
that i was investigating them for

195
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,919
which most the time was financial crimes

196
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,319
so i typically already had that motive

197
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,120
ahead of time

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
just by doing this so it was really

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
beneficial to me

200
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
as an investigator you never want to go

201
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,199
into an interview or an interrogation

202
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
and not have the answers to the

203
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
questions that you're asking

204
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,840
so that gave me a baseline for when they

205
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,039
were lying

206
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,080
um along with you know i i had questions

207
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,720
to ask

208
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
for a baseline when i was doing the uh

209
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,160
interview

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,280
so that i knew you know what their norm

211
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,599
was for their body language their cues

212
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,440
so that also applies to our online

213
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,639
investigations

214
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,479
it's giving you a baseline for what's

215
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,840
normal in their life

216
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
you're looking for those patterns you're

217
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,880
looking for the breaks in those patterns

218
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,160
so that's why we want to do this

219
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
all right so let's dig in um here

220
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,879
are some of the things and i have a few

221
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,599
slides on this that i like to look at

222
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,080
first so one of the first things that i

223
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
like to do when i'm

224
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
investigating folks is i want to know

225
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,840
what their general demeanor is

226
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
you can typically tell this through

227
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,360
photos and videos

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
posts of a person you if their

229
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
posts are more negative are they more

230
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
positive are they a happy person a sad

231
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,520
person

232
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,319
um you you can typically tell all of

233
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,599
this through

234
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,479
you their posts and their pictures um

235
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
even the backgrounds and their pictures

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,800
like

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,319
you know what do they have on their wall

238
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,080
what do they have as

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
colors in in the clothing that they're

240
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,320
wearing so all of that plays into this

241
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
you also want to look at their friends

242
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
because um

243
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,080
their friends tell you a lot or lack of

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
friends for that matter too

245
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
you is it um that they have a ton of

246
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
friends that they're really outgoing

247
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,600
that they are out there you know uh

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,839
socializing they go to events

249
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
or are they a homebody um are they

250
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
somebody that typically likes to stay at

251
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,560
home

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
they're reading books you know just

253
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
hanging out with their family

254
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
what is that baseline for them and then

255
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,600
you know through the investigation right

256
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
before they went missing

257
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,080
what what happened was there something

258
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,120
in their timeline

259
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
or in the investigation that you're

260
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
looking at that changed dramatically

261
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
was there some kind of mood change their

262
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,080
posts

263
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,120
you know became darker um so

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,760
take a look at the friends and then also

265
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
if they have that one best friend

266
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
that is consistently there you you

267
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
definitely want to investigate that

268
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
person too

269
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
and see what their baseline is as well

270
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,480
on top of that family is huge so

271
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,880
does somebody have family in their life

272
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
are they posting pictures of

273
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
could be kids it could be parents you

274
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,399
know siblings

275
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,360
um are there people that are around

276
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,720
constantly

277
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,680
and then you also is there one family

278
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,399
member

279
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,959
that is always around that is always in

280
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,880
the photos that is right next to that

281
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
person constantly

282
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
um that can actually signify somebody

283
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,320
that

284
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,519
doesn't want that person out of their

285
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,920
their you know distance like they want

286
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,640
them

287
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
within their realm so that they can

288
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,920
control that person

289
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
so you know take note of anything that

290
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,519
that looks kind of odd as well because a

291
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,480
lot of times

292
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
um with missing persons um or in

293
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
criminal activity it's it's actually

294
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,600
somebody that the person knows

295
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
so take note of that as well pets are a

296
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,680
big one

297
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,240
is this person outgoing they like their

298
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,880
pets

299
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,560
um are they abusive to pets that can be

300
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,920
a signal as well um

301
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,040
you are they reaching out um you know

302
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
and talking about these pets are they

303
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
talking about you know family members

304
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,360
and getting new pets or

305
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,560
adopting pets fostering pets um you

306
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,519
how are they discussing those things in

307
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,320
their posts

308
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
so that can give you a baseline as well

309
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
their likes and dislikes i mean

310
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
obviously we're looking at their pages

311
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
we're looking at

312
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,320
what kind of things they're doing

313
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,760
hobbies um

314
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,440
groups that they're a part of do they

315
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,560
you go out to a certain location

316
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
because they liked a coffee shop is that

317
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,760
a clue

318
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
so likes and dislikes also tell us a lot

319
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
for my investigations a couple of the

320
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
first things that i looked at

321
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,240
because it was financial crime was money

322
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
in the background of their photos and

323
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
their videos did they

324
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
are they bragging about getting new

325
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,560
clothes new cars you know suddenly did

326
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,079
they come into money

327
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,279
um and you know why is that money there

328
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,360
so that can be something that you really

329
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
need to look at too like if they were

330
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,959
poor for a long time and all of a sudden

331
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,320
they come into money and they're blowing

332
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,880
it

333
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,000
why is that what changed um that all of

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
a sudden or what are they doing

335
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
you to to get that could signal

336
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,120
if some sort of criminal activity could

337
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
signal you know

338
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,760
um a john that's paying them um that

339
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,880
could lead into

340
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
you know why they went missing my

341
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
chief my former chief uh taught me that

342
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
one of the first things that you look at

343
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,399
in investigations is who's sleeping with

344
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,120
who

345
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
and that may sign sound funny um but

346
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
when you're investigating people

347
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,959
you really want to look at you the

348
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,800
relationships because the last thing

349
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
that i wanted to do was go into an

350
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
office and interview somebody

351
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,600
and not know that that person's having

352
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
an affair with you know

353
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
my my suspect so the same with osit

354
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
investigations

355
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,519
can you pick on the pick up on the clues

356
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:39,920
um

357
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
who are they flirting with who are they

358
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,120
looking

359
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,920
at they're constantly liking their posts

360
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,639
um

361
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,440
are they in pictures with this person so

362
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,800
you might want to take a look at that

363
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,240
and even if they're married

364
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
um you know definitely you know that

365
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
doesn't mean that they're not having

366
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,320
outside relationships so take a look at

367
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,800
those

368
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,920
as well and all these things like i said

369
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,480
it

370
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
gets you into their mind it gives you a

371
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,760
baseline on their behaviors

372
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,000
and as soon as you have that baseline on

373
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
their behaviors

374
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
you're going to know what when they step

375
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000
out of those behaviors

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,320
and that can signal an event that then

377
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
possibly would lead up to why they're

378
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,040
missing

379
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,720
and i keep saying missing because

380
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
obviously we are

381
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
doing this uh conference for missing

382
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,320
persons trace labs um

383
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,040
national child exploitation so uh

384
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,920
definitely take a look at those two

385
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,160
things first and then here's the next

386
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
slide so some of these things that you

387
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
really want to look at

388
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,480
watch the videos so i like to study

389
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
human behavior i like to study the body

390
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,360
language and

391
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,240
everybody has clues that they give out

392
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,199
so one of my tells uh that that i'll

393
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,880
just give everybody is if i'm

394
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,519
really concerned i sit and i start

395
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,040
twirling my hair

396
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
and if i'm really thinking about

397
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
something in depth

398
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
you can tell because i'm twirling my

399
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,880
hair everybody has one of those nervous

400
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
tics or those tells

401
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,959
and if you watch enough of their videos

402
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
you'll be able to pick up on those

403
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,839
and then watch you know further on down

404
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,240
the

405
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
road their videos their their latest

406
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
videos and see if those

407
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
tells show up or if there are other

408
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,839
clues

409
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,720
that might give you um the feeling that

410
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
something's off

411
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
that there's somebody in the room that

412
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
you know might be bothering them

413
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,959
um that just is making them

414
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,160
uncomfortable

415
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,079
but on videos make sure that you're

416
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,079
paying attention to the platform that

417
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
you're watching the videos on

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,120
because um even if you are in you know

419
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
one of your

420
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
undercover accounts your sock accounts

421
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,680
um

422
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,040
you it might show that you

423
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,880
have viewed that video so you want to

424
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
make sure that you're using opsec when

425
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,360
you're doing all of this of course

426
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
looking at their music or their linked

427
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
pages we talked about the pages a little

428
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
bit earlier but music is a big one

429
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,360
um there's several cases that i've

430
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,639
worked that

431
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
either the person had you know a very

432
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
specific taste in music and then at the

433
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,320
end it changed

434
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,639
they started listening to darker music

435
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,560
or you know they went from

436
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
bluegrass to all of a sudden heavy metal

437
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,480
or you know something that was

438
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
significantly off

439
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,639
pay attention to their music and then um

440
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,720
one of the things that you will note

441
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,079
in somebody that is uh depressed is

442
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,199
they tend to listen to music to cope

443
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,800
um a lot of times and so they will post

444
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,920
the songs on their timeline

445
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,120
that really are speaking to them

446
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
and so pay attention to that music so if

447
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
you're noticing they're posting lots of

448
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,160
music

449
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,440
and it might be a little bit on the

450
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,079
sadder side the darker side

451
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,000
you pay attention to those things as

452
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,160
well same goes for your friends and

453
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,959
family members

454
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,240
and these are all things that you can

455
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,959
use to get a baseline on them as well

456
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,639
and make sure that you know when

457
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
something is off

458
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
um it also weapons

459
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,040
i've uh had several cases where it's

460
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
very obvious in the background

461
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,720
they have you know ars or pistols or

462
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
knives or you know whatever sitting out

463
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,399
in the background

464
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
um so you want to take note of those

465
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,560
things and make sure that you're aware

466
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:28,880
that

467
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
you know those there are weapons

468
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,240
involved

469
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,079
and you know if law enforcement already

470
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,920
hasn't picked up on that

471
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,199
it's definitely something you'll want to

472
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,800
put in your notes for them

473
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,720
also note computer equipment so

474
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
law enforcement is typically very good

475
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,160
when you guys are investigating these

476
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,759
cases about already knowing

477
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,279
you know what computer equipment is

478
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
involved but if you notice

479
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
that there are laptops or phones or

480
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,800
whatever

481
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
one of the things that i always did was

482
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,199
take a screenshot of those

483
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,240
and save that picture so that

484
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
um we can look for that if law

485
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
enforcement is going to go out and do a

486
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,199
search warrant

487
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,679
um or they're talking to a parent for

488
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,039
you know missing child

489
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
they can then ask for that specific

490
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,240
computer equipment

491
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,799
um and computer equipment could also

492
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,720
give you a baseline on a person too like

493
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
what type of computer equipment is it

494
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,919
are they very techy

495
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
um do you see you know different things

496
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
laying around on their desks that would

497
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,799
indicate that

498
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,960
they've built the computer themselves

499
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
that they might have

500
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
you know other devices set up that you

501
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,679
might want to take a look at

502
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,600
so it can tell you what type of person

503
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,120
they are there as well

504
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
um god forbid anybody gets a baseline on

505
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
any of us right because we have computer

506
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
equipment everywhere

507
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,039
but um that's something you want to look

508
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,400
at

509
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,720
also note do they mention other

510
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,679
employment

511
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,440
besides their main employment or are

512
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
they you volunteering

513
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,679
at different locations those are all

514
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,720
things you want to take

515
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
note of too if they are constantly

516
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
volunteering for stuff

517
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,240
that might be an avenue that you want to

518
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
you know look down as well

519
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,120
so all of these things

520
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,880
get you that baseline that you need to

521
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,640
know so that you can tell

522
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
if something is off um in

523
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
in your investigation so when you're

524
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,360
doing all this uh just

525
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
you know quick keeping tabs on things

526
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
make sure you're taking detailed notes

527
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,799
of stuff that you

528
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,880
is setting your spidey sense off as i

529
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,000
like to say

530
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
um you what is your gut telling you take

531
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,799
detailed notes of those things you know

532
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,080
take screenshots of

533
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,960
everything that you're seeing um also

534
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,799
huge huge issue here

535
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,880
make sure you're copying down all the

536
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
full urls of the social media sites

537
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
um i've had so many investigations where

538
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,799
somebody's come to me and just

539
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,520
handed me a folder with screenshots of

540
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,240
like you know

541
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,360
bob smith um here's bob smith and this

542
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
is his facebook page but it doesn't give

543
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,400
me a url

544
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
um to where i can then subpoena that

545
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
information so copy that stuff down

546
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,919
keep track of names and relationships i

547
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,000
like to make a whole diagram for myself

548
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
when i'm doing

549
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
large investigations and that way i know

550
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
who's connected to who

551
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,280
and that can be really significant in a

552
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,600
missing person's case

553
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,080
also significant dates or events like if

554
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
you're noticing birthdays or are they

555
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,720
celebrating

556
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,760
you a certain holiday so

557
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
keep track of all those significant

558
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,440
dates and events that you notice on

559
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
their timeline

560
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,919
and then i urge everybody in ocean

561
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
investigations obviously develop your

562
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
own template

563
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
and your own workflow so one of the

564
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,320
things that i do

565
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,960
um i've been doing this gosh for almost

566
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,720
13 years now i'm going to date myself a

567
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,080
little bit there

568
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,720
so i have a template that i use that i

569
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,679
go down

570
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,400
religiously you know from start to

571
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,960
finish

572
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,480
that's just how it works best for me

573
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,360
i use that on every investigation of

574
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
course we're always going to have rabbit

575
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
holes

576
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,720
that we go down but at least you have a

577
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
baseline for yourself and a workflow for

578
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,640
yourself

579
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
so those are some of the things that i

580
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,320
do

581
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
uh to get a baseline in a psychological

582
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,440
background

583
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,840
on somebody in my ocean investigation so

584
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,360
you know i know that was a really quick

585
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,120
overview of some of the things that we

586
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,960
do but i wanted to talk about that

587
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
because i get asked about it a lot

588
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,200
so the first part like i said is is

589
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
getting the psychological background of

590
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,559
somebody else

591
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,240
now with all of the things that we see

592
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
let's talk about mental health and

593
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,280
coping

594
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
with the things that we see um i know

595
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,480
this isn't

596
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,840
the sexy subject in ocean investigations

597
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
but it's really necessary that we start

598
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,760
talking about this because

599
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,559
um as we all know ocean is not all

600
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,080
rainbows and unicorns

601
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
and if you're doing this long enough

602
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,600
you're going to see most of the stuff

603
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,440
that's on this list

604
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,760
you know child exploitation abuse either

605
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,000
physical or mental

606
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
pure evil now people are like what what

607
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
are you talking about

608
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
you know when you see pure evil i've run

609
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,400
across across it twice in my life

610
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,520
um i the last time i saw it this guy

611
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,640
you know in a case that i was doing i

612
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
walked into the room and you just

613
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,039
you feel it you can see it in their face

614
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,159
you can feel it

615
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
it's just pure evil and some of the

616
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
stuff that you see

617
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,520
falls along that as well obviously death

618
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
i mean some of these missing persons

619
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,039
aren't going to come back

620
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,000
um they're missing for a reason and it's

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,679
because you know they have

622
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,400
they're deceased so um you're gonna see

623
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,360
that you're gonna see

624
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,400
people's lives ruined because of the

625
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,679
things that are happening

626
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,559
in these investigations you know what

627
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:50,960
what

628
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,080
led up to them you know becoming

629
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,120
that missing person so drug abuse is a

630
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,760
big one

631
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,000
so we'll see a lot of drug abuse or

632
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,919
forced drug abuse and when i say forced

633
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,280
drug abuse i mean

634
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,799
they're being held against their will

635
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
they're being um you know

636
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,039
forced to take those drugs to keep them

637
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,640
under control so

638
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,840
if you're doing this long enough you're

639
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,679
going to see one or multiple of these

640
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,559
things

641
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,159
so here's how we cope

642
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,240
um you know don't let the subject get

643
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,559
into your mind don't let these cases

644
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,120
get into your head and stay there i mean

645
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
obviously you have to think about them

646
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,760
you're going to see this stuff but

647
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
here's some of the coping techniques

648
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,600
that i have learned to do

649
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,120
and that i've been trained to do so

650
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,559
the first is the honeycomb effect

651
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
and what i mean by this so you see this

652
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
this glass

653
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,280
um you have the silos and you have the

654
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,559
honeycombs

655
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,600
so typically with a lot of people

656
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
you know their brain is like this glass

657
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,159
of water and when something bad happens

658
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,039
it's like putting um a food a drop of

659
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,320
food coloring

660
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,760
into that glass and it just spreads

661
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,159
it affects every part of your life

662
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,480
everything that you do

663
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,440
and you don't have a way to segment that

664
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
or compartmentalize that

665
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,919
and so what we're taught in law

666
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,200
enforcement

667
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
and what i've been taught through

668
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
multiple trainings is to

669
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,240
compartmentalize everything in your life

670
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,159
which is called the honeycomb effect

671
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,919
think of bees

672
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,400
and their hive there's a reason that

673
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,159
they use this hexagon

674
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,559
it's because it's strong and it can

675
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,760
separate the honey

676
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,520
from the eggs from you know whatever

677
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,200
else they're they're holding in that

678
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
hive

679
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,400
they don't want cross-contamination the

680
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
same thing goes for your brain

681
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,679
you want to compartmentalize this stuff

682
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,520
you want to make sure that your family

683
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,240
and your work

684
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
and your food and your cases and your

685
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,640
music and your you know whatever it is

686
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,360
side jobs and you everything that you do

687
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,679
is

688
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,919
in a compartment now that doesn't mean

689
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,919
that your work isn't going to bleed over

690
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,919
into your family life and your food

691
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,360
isn't going to bleed over into family

692
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,480
because hopefully you're eating with

693
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
your family right

694
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,559
but you need to compartmentalize those

695
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,480
things so that you can better contain

696
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,120
them

697
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,039
and more importantly contain your

698
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,240
emotions

699
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,080
when something regarding those things

700
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,760
comes up um

701
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,120
this is one of the things that they

702
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,799
taught me in sniper

703
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,480
uh training was you have to

704
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,000
compartmentalize things

705
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
and we're going to go into a little bit

706
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,200
deeper

707
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
into that mentality a little bit later

708
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,480
but

709
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,919
um basically it's focusing on the task

710
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,960
at hand

711
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,520
instead of the emotions that surround

712
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,159
the bigger

713
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,279
event so with this i'm not saying

714
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,799
to close stuff off i'm just saying

715
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,440
separate them because closing them off

716
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,279
is bad as well so here's what happens so

717
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,240
this is our brain

718
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,559
and we have all of these compartments

719
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,880
right that are popping up

720
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,679
that um you know we're trying to keep

721
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,559
track of

722
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,840
but what happens is you know like this

723
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,000
little thing you've got your cases and

724
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,640
if you don't deal with the emotions

725
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,039
in each of these compartments they're

726
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,080
gonna start bleeding

727
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
over you're gonna start seeing the

728
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,000
emotions

729
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,520
and um you know the trauma pop up

730
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,559
in different locations in your life um

731
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,840
and so that's what we really want to

732
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
contain and we really want to

733
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
work on so this is one of the ways that

734
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
you can do it so

735
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
you make sure that each of these things

736
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,720
are separated

737
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
and you deal with each of them

738
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,799
differently so

739
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,360
your emotions surrounding your friends

740
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,039
you're gonna deal with those emotions

741
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,880
differently then you're gonna deal with

742
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,360
the emotions that you see um when you

743
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,159
travel

744
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,320
or you know if you're writing a book

745
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,600
those emotions

746
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,559
need to be dealt with differently so um

747
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
you with cases

748
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,720
you have to deal with the emotions as

749
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,919
they come up

750
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,480
so that you are not then seeing all of

751
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,400
these bleed over into other parts of

752
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,440
your life

753
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,120
so before um you know these compartments

754
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,880
get overflowed um or start overflowing

755
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,159
and they start pushing

756
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,159
you start pushing things away you're

757
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
suppressing those you're not dealing

758
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,520
with the emotions in them

759
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,159
um and they start bleeding over you

760
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,159
we're going to talk about some

761
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,159
coping mechanisms that can help this

762
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,200
kind of stuff

763
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,559
but first you want to make sure that

764
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,159
you're compartmentalizing everything

765
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,240
that you do in your life

766
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
so again not saying that you're not

767
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
going to have things that stick

768
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,720
with you not that you know some things

769
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
aren't going to bleed over they are it's

770
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,159
the nature of the beast

771
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,559
but you can prevent them from being as

772
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,600
severe

773
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,480
as what they were so okay here's one of

774
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,960
those

775
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,080
content warning slides i'm going to talk

776
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,520
about a case of mine

777
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,600
that involves a missing child right now

778
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,320
so i'm not going to go into depth

779
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
but um you know just trigger warning

780
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
there

781
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,960
so one of the worst cases

782
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,279
and what really got me thinking about

783
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,159
this

784
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,360
entire process

785
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,880
and really kicked off my learning

786
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
of all these coping mechanisms was

787
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,440
um a few years ago uh

788
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,240
i got called out um got a text on my

789
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,960
phone like

790
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,720
i always did with the sheriff's office

791
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,480
that i volunteered for

792
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,399
um that said hey we have a four-year-old

793
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,919
missing child

794
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,360
i need every deputy everybody that is

795
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
able to come out and help search for

796
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,279
this child to come out

797
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,720
so of course i suited up you

798
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,440
went had a team we got there they gave

799
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,720
us the coordinates

800
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,799
it was in the middle of the country and

801
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,399
so uh there was

802
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,480
woods all around this house there were

803
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,039
ponds in multiple different locations

804
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,960
hills valleys i mean there was just a

805
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,360
lot of ground to cover

806
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,640
um the background on this uh the mom had

807
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
not seen the child in a couple hours

808
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
like she had been searching frantically

809
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,640
um as was the entire family

810
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,159
before they called law enforcement in so

811
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
um you that's kind of the background so

812
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,120
long story short um my team there were

813
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,080
six of us

814
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,159
we go we search the woods we're

815
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,159
searching the ponds we're searching

816
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,279
every place we can search um

817
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,399
we found the little boy and

818
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,320
you know i'm gonna spare you the details

819
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,559
but he he was not alive

820
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,080
um in that like i made

821
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,039
two very fatal errors that day and like

822
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,200
i said this is what kicked me into

823
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
you know the training behind all this

824
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,440
and really starting to understand myself

825
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,600
and how i deal with the situation

826
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
the first mistake that i made was

827
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
uh i stuck around when they told the

828
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,720
mother

829
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,080
that you know we had found her baby and

830
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,279
oh gosh i will never forget that scream

831
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,320
as long as i live and then two

832
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,679
the second error that i made was um

833
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,399
what i'm going to teach you to avoid in

834
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,320
all of these cases because obviously

835
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,080
i hope you don't ever have to go through

836
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,679
that but the second one

837
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,919
is i packed up my stuff i got in my car

838
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,240
i

839
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,600
tried to suppress my emotions and just

840
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
push them down

841
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,600
and just drive it was the day before

842
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,399
easter

843
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,679
i had procrastinated um thought that i

844
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,279
you know would have the entire day to go

845
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,919
out and do some easter shopping

846
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,520
so i drove straight to walmart

847
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
to do my easter basket shopping for my

848
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,279
son and my niece who was staying at with

849
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,799
me at the time

850
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,760
and you know you just can't dodge them

851
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,200
those emotions you have to deal with

852
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
them

853
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,120
so here i am in full uniform

854
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,520
in the middle of an easter basket aisle

855
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,039
at walmart

856
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,200
and i i lost it i completely broke down

857
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,799
in the middle of this aisle just

858
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,480
boohooing tears it wasn't pretty

859
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,279
um so you know had people around me

860
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,159
thinking

861
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,760
what is going on with this this woman

862
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,000
so because of that and because i've

863
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,799
tried to trying to dodge my emotions

864
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,159
i had a full breakdown and um

865
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,159
you know some of the things that i

866
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,679
should have done

867
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,120
and we're going to talk about is i

868
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
needed to change

869
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,360
that scenery i needed to to distance

870
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,880
myself from that

871
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,360
so here are some of the things that i

872
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,720
should have done

873
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
i should have changed that scenery i

874
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,799
should have went home

875
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,880
i should have washed it off take a

876
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,080
shower the

877
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,799
act of physically taking a shower is

878
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,600
huge

879
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,279
so even if you're doing an ocean

880
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,840
investigation go take a shower after a

881
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,640
bad one

882
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,240
if you're doing something that really is

883
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
hitting you go take a shower

884
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,679
just wash every bad thing off of you

885
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,240
um there's a psychological you know

886
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
background to actually doing that

887
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,240
in and there is scientific evidence that

888
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,519
says that that does

889
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,399
you know help it's also why you hear of

890
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,360
rape victims

891
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,399
often taking showers afterwards because

892
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,000
they want to feel clean

893
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,279
so psychologically your brain thinks of

894
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,720
a shower in cleansing the same applies

895
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,840
with fresh clothes

896
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,880
you know take your clothes change them

897
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,360
put something comfortable on you make

898
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,480
that separation

899
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,320
it's all about change talk it out

900
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,559
call somebody you know everybody needs a

901
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,399
support system

902
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,880
so one of the things that i did after

903
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,840
this

904
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,080
actually was several days afterwards

905
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,440
instead of right afterwards

906
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,799
was doing a debrief we most law

907
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,559
enforcement agencies have a chaplain

908
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,240
so i called my chaplain talked it out

909
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,320
you need to do that almost right away

910
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,600
because just getting

911
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,360
all of that off your chest getting it

912
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
off your mind

913
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,600
helps to make that break and just flush

914
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,799
it out

915
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,240
the sooner that you can do that the

916
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,880
better uh distance yourself

917
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,519
separate the events by time you know

918
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,760
instead of me going directly to walmart

919
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,880
to go shopping

920
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,919
um i needed to separate that i needed to

921
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,679
go home first

922
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,399
and you know take all of the things that

923
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,279
i said first

924
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,600
and then take a couple hours eat dinner

925
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
with your family you know just

926
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,919
deal with your stuff at home and then go

927
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,399
do

928
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,600
you know other stuff and reset you know

929
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
make sure you're resetting your entire

930
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,559
world

931
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,640
and we'll talk about some of the the

932
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,159
things that you can do

933
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,720
to reset um in the next slide

934
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,600
so uh some of the tips and tricks while

935
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
you're working

936
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,640
in ocean cases set up your environment

937
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
so it's different and i know that it's

938
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,399
really hard to do while you're

939
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,080
working from home right now but

940
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,240
any little change helps so it could be

941
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
turn a light on

942
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,399
that you wouldn't normally turn on um

943
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,840
change if you have like i bought a 20

944
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,039
uh desk mat at on amazon

945
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,960
and the two different sides are

946
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,159
different colors

947
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,559
switch the color on the desk mat

948
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,640
anything that makes it different

949
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,279
to where what your regular work is in

950
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,200
your ocean investigations are

951
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,240
are completely different think about

952
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,519
what food you're eating

953
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,519
the clothing you're wearing the music

954
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,039
that you're listening to

955
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,159
the scents around you all of those can

956
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,440
be trigger points

957
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
and potential negative associations for

958
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
you if you're

959
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
listening to your favorite song and you

960
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,000
happen to see an image that's terrible

961
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,960
your brain will actually connect the two

962
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,440
and

963
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,320
cause that to be a negative association

964
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,760
so make sure you're thinking about that

965
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,039
kind of thing

966
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,440
your five senses obviously the fewer the

967
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
senses the less associations

968
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,960
um that you can potentially have so

969
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,760
one of the things that i was taught um

970
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,399
on day one and i'm so glad that somebody

971
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,560
said this to me is do not put speakers

972
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,800
on your forensic machine when you're

973
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,560
working abuse or child pornography cases

974
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,320
and i thought it was so stupid i'm like

975
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
why wouldn't you want speakers

976
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,520
so look at the picture in this slide

977
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
of this roller coaster and the people

978
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
having a fun time

979
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,399
your brain does not need to hear those

980
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,639
people screaming it doesn't need to hear

981
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,679
the clink

982
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
of the roller coaster going up the hill

983
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,760
or coming down the hill

984
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,480
your brain automatically connects those

985
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,879
things

986
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,679
and you can hear that picture the same

987
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,280
goes for when you're working

988
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
horrible abuse cases or cp cases ocean

989
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,839
investigations

990
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,720
you don't want to hear what's going on

991
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,800
in those videos

992
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
or you know whatever you're looking at

993
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,920
so if you

994
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
know that you're going to work one of

995
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,599
those cases do not put speakers on your

996
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,400
machine

997
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,200
trust me on this it will save you a lot

998
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
of uh

999
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,520
psychologist bills um and then take

1000
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,320
regular breaks you know even when you're

1001
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,920
working this is you know

1002
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,480
just basic stuff but take a regular

1003
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,040
break

1004
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,880
get up go walk um go get a drink

1005
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,200
go outside you know if you're at home

1006
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,960
let the dogs out take a walk around the

1007
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,680
block

1008
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,440
you have to reset your brain for a

1009
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,280
little bit and recharge

1010
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
um and then the last one there when i

1011
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,079
talked about reset on that

1012
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,400
last slide one of the things that you

1013
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
can really do to reset yourself

1014
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,839
in an ocean investigation um when you're

1015
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,880
done

1016
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
especially if you're working at home and

1017
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,839
you can't really switch you know your

1018
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,440
environment close out your screens

1019
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,359
close out your tabs i know that's

1020
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,359
terrifying to some of us

1021
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,480
but close those tabs out just the act

1022
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,640
of hitting that x and closing those

1023
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,839
things out

1024
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,960
signifies a break and signifies

1025
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,440
something different is about to happen

1026
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
we're going to switch gears

1027
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,920
and that will help you significantly

1028
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,720
when you're

1029
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,599
you know switching from working you know

1030
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,400
at home

1031
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
to having to go out to the living room

1032
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,839
and talk to your family

1033
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,880
you don't get that drive home to reset

1034
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,200
so sometimes just closing those things

1035
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,160
out um

1036
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,400
and that signifies to your brain that

1037
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,839
we're about to switch places

1038
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,440
so um any little thing like that

1039
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,280
definitely helps so those are some tips

1040
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,680
and tricks that i have learned

1041
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,480
um all right second and last uh content

1042
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,359
warning

1043
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,760
um i'm gonna talk about a case of mine

1044
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,560
this was

1045
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,839
the worst case that i've ever done

1046
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,119
it was the last case that i did and

1047
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,920
this involves child sexual assault so

1048
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
content warning here

1049
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,160
all right this was my last case um

1050
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,680
i background on this um

1051
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,200
the dea was doing a search warrant on

1052
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,040
this individual's house

1053
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,200
when for drugs something completely

1054
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,320
unrelated

1055
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,560
and when they went into the house and

1056
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,240
they were doing the search warrant on

1057
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,640
his

1058
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,839
his devices um they typically will

1059
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,160
will triage at the scene and so they'll

1060
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,960
look at you

1061
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,680
the stuff that's on a phone or a

1062
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,359
computer right there

1063
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,560
um and so uh one of the detectives

1064
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
or agents happened to look at his his

1065
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,599
cell phone

1066
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,240
and noticed that there were lewd images

1067
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,200
and videos

1068
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,040
of his step daughter so

1069
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,599
um what happened is they immediately

1070
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,480
shut down

1071
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,119
their investigation um you brought

1072
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,280
everybody out of the house pulled back

1073
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,000
did a secondary search warrant um called

1074
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,960
in the fbi

1075
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,119
and the fbi was able to grab every

1076
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,480
device

1077
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,920
because of the timeline of this and

1078
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,000
you needing to get this done quickly and

1079
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,599
turned over

1080
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,920
they called me in and so this was one of

1081
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,200
the things that

1082
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,599
i worked on last and they called several

1083
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,960
of us in

1084
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,280
i actually took all of the computer

1085
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,320
devices

1086
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,520
and a detective buddy of mine took

1087
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,720
all of the mobile devices tablets um

1088
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,160
and so we split those up so um

1089
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,880
this is merrick grigsby um he was

1090
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,000
sentenced like the says

1091
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,359
to 27 years in prison um what

1092
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,440
this does not tell you is uh

1093
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,720
that although it lists you know menial

1094
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,400
33 videos and 23 images

1095
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,040
what you don't see is he had over 300

1096
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,079
000

1097
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,599
videos and over 200 000 images

1098
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,320
on multiple devices that took me close

1099
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,480
to six months to actually go through the

1100
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,200
entirety

1101
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,320
of these devices it doesn't show me

1102
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,680
puking in my office trash can

1103
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,400
it doesn't show the sleepless nights the

1104
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,200
break

1105
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,720
breakdowns the trauma afterwards

1106
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,040
this was the most horrific case that

1107
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
i've ever had to work on

1108
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,119
um and so in this investigation

1109
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,839
i obviously had to pull from all of

1110
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,520
things we just talked about

1111
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,119
um but then i also had to do some

1112
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,200
additional things to cope with

1113
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,240
what i had seen um and i'm not gonna lie

1114
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,960
like it still bothers me i still have

1115
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,359
flashbacks of this case

1116
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,680
but i can tell you that i would do

1117
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,480
everything

1118
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,520
in this case all over again to ensure

1119
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,960
this outcome this guy was a monster

1120
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,599
so this was you know like i said the

1121
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,440
last investigation i did

1122
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,040
because of the images that they found

1123
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
immediately on his phone

1124
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,520
they were able to arrest him on site so

1125
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,240
he was taken out of the household

1126
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,040
the children that he was abusing were

1127
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,520
safe

1128
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,920
from that point on but we still had to

1129
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,880
make sure that

1130
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,359
we were uh quickly getting the

1131
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,960
turnaround on this

1132
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
at least for a number of videos and

1133
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,400
images so that he could

1134
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,680
be charged um so

1135
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
that investigation so here's what i

1136
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,880
learned

1137
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,960
and some of the coping mechanisms that

1138
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,560
you can use

1139
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,480
not only in you know i know we have some

1140
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,079
forensic folks on here

1141
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,319
um you know those types of cases but in

1142
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,480
your ocean investigations

1143
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,839
when you're sitting down to look at it

1144
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:40,720
could be

1145
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,920
you know the uh missing child or a

1146
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,599
missing person

1147
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,440
try not to get into the emotions behind

1148
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,240
things

1149
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,599
you focus on the rational aspect of the

1150
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,960
investigation

1151
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,800
make sure that you're looking at you um

1152
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,359
what's actually going on what you need

1153
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,240
to find

1154
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,040
your task at hand uh what you have to

1155
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,240
identify to and

1156
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,040
to complete that task instead of viewing

1157
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,680
the event

1158
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,520
in its entirety um so you know focus on

1159
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,119
when you're doing this the responses

1160
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,359
that you're having and not the trauma

1161
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:17,760
you know

1162
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,000
are you clinching your fists are you

1163
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
angry are you noticing that you're

1164
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,359
breathing heavy

1165
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,359
so what you need to do when you're doing

1166
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,560
all this stuff

1167
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,920
is complete or disrupt

1168
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,480
the responses in that stop the emotional

1169
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,440
response

1170
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,839
to stop that event from being stored in

1171
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,040
your head

1172
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,800
you're essentially stopping that

1173
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,079
negative chemical dump that's happening

1174
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,880
so again think about the task at hand

1175
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,280
you

1176
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,319
think about positive visualization

1177
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,839
you think about the child that's going

1178
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,680
to be reunited with his parents think

1179
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,240
about

1180
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,880
the parents getting closure catching the

1181
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,359
bad guy whatever it is do some positive

1182
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,400
visualization with that um journaling

1183
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,079
get it out we discussed talking to

1184
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,839
somebody earlier

1185
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,240
journaling is a way that maybe if you

1186
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,720
don't you're not ready to talk about it

1187
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,839
write it down the the act of writing and

1188
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,280
actually seeing those words

1189
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,520
on paper you know a lot of times i would

1190
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,319
do that

1191
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,720
you tear up the paper and throw it away

1192
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,440
and that

1193
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,359
was you know closure for me it helped

1194
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,200
get that out

1195
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,000
and then time you're driving home when

1196
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,319
you

1197
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,560
i was at work and the time that it took

1198
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,760
me to drive home was my reset

1199
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,070
oftentimes i would put meditation

1200
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,560
[Music]

1201
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,400
tracks on or i would put you know

1202
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,640
calming music on and just reset myself

1203
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,040
on the on the drive home

1204
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,880
so we talked about you know the reset

1205
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,640
with the tabs and the windows

1206
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,319
the same thing you know when you're

1207
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,720
driving home just reset yourself

1208
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,280
um leave work at work i can't say this

1209
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,960
enough and again i know most of us are

1210
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
working from home right now so it's hard

1211
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
um but make sure that you're resetting

1212
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,400
yourself completely

1213
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,960
a support system is so important you

1214
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,920
know

1215
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,880
if you can't talk about your cases which

1216
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,520
some of us

1217
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,200
couldn't um you make sure that you at

1218
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,839
least

1219
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,760
can tell somebody look i had a really

1220
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,960
bad day

1221
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
can we go do something can we get out

1222
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,359
can we go for a walk can we go for a

1223
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,160
bike ride

1224
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,240
can we just separate you know what i had

1225
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,599
to deal with today

1226
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,000
i don't want to talk about it at the

1227
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,680
moment i can't talk about it

1228
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,119
but i do want to switch gears

1229
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,000
and then meditate or do yoga breathing

1230
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,839
techniques i give some

1231
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,520
links at the end of this presentation

1232
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,200
for all this kind of stuff

1233
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,720
i can tell you with that case that i

1234
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,319
just showed you a second ago

1235
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,119
if i did not have my yoga class at that

1236
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,880
time i don't know what i would have done

1237
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,119
um i took everything out on that yoga

1238
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,079
mat i mean

1239
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,000
it saved me a lot of sleepless nights

1240
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,119
resetting yourself um again you know

1241
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,160
anything that you do to you switch uh

1242
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,760
gears and change tasks um

1243
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,720
for me i had you know 20 to 30 different

1244
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,880
cases pending at any given time

1245
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,200
so i could work on one thing and switch

1246
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,240
gears to

1247
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,200
a much lighter case maybe somebody stole

1248
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,960
some money from the local government

1249
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,520
office

1250
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,720
it was different so i could change tasks

1251
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,640
same at work or if you're doing

1252
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,000
investigations on this

1253
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,480
you switch to a different person if

1254
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,160
you're investigating you know missing

1255
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,720
persons

1256
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,960
switch to you another case that you're

1257
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,040
working on or switch to another task go

1258
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,880
do your laundry

1259
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,560
anything you can do to just switch it up

1260
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,040
a little bit

1261
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,839
okay so here are my two favorite um

1262
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,359
coping mechanisms

1263
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,920
the first one is called the 54321

1264
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,599
grounding method

1265
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,160
this also helps with anxiety it helps

1266
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,079
with depression it helps just snap your

1267
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,079
brain out of any negative response that

1268
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,760
it's having

1269
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
again i'm going to put a link to this at

1270
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,000
the end but

1271
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,720
if you're having a tough time and you

1272
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,760
really don't want to get up

1273
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
you know from your desk or take that

1274
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,880
break

1275
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,599
look around you and notice and say out

1276
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,319
loud

1277
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,240
five things you see around you around

1278
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,599
your desk wherever

1279
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,000
that you can see just look at different

1280
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,720
things that

1281
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,000
you know snap you out of what you're

1282
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
looking at then

1283
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,680
pay attention to what you can hear can

1284
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
you hear cars outside can you hear

1285
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,599
my dog barking a minute ago can you hear

1286
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,800
birds in the trees

1287
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,280
so think about four things you can hear

1288
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,599
three things you can smell

1289
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,520
two things you can physically touch you

1290
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,119
know think about the texture

1291
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,760
and just pay attention be um you're

1292
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,160
mentally cognizant of what you're doing

1293
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,720
and then one thing you can taste and i

1294
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,319
highly recommend that that one thing you

1295
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,280
can taste

1296
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,000
is water hydrate yourself i know we all

1297
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,920
like to hydrate in other ways coffee

1298
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,240
alcohol whatever it is but highly

1299
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,599
recommend hydrate

1300
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,359
water you make sure you're taking care

1301
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,079
of yourself

1302
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,880
um this is a big one it's called halt uh

1303
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,200
negative behaviors are most likely to

1304
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,680
happen

1305
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,000
when we are these four things hungry

1306
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,079
angry lonely or tired

1307
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,720
um and a lot of times all four of these

1308
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,520
things happen

1309
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,760
at night which is one of the reasons you

1310
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,480
get a higher suicide rate at night

1311
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,400
you know you might be hungry you're

1312
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,920
angry because your day just went

1313
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,400
terribly your boss treated you bad your

1314
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,520
significant other was just horrible

1315
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,200
you're lonely you're home alone you just

1316
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,880
don't feel like anybody's around

1317
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,359
and you're tired so many of us burn

1318
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,640
ourselves out

1319
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,760
so um you if you can identify one of

1320
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,440
these four conditions

1321
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,160
when you have the urge to do something

1322
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,520
negative

1323
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,280
you take note of this switch it up

1324
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,920
you go make sure that you eat something

1325
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,319
you drink something

1326
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,319
call somebody on the phone and most

1327
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,520
importantly get

1328
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,200
sleep it's so necessary

1329
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,240
we all are human we make mistakes we

1330
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,359
have emotions

1331
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,119
it's part of you know who we are if you

1332
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,280
don't have emotions you know

1333
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,680
i'm going to worry about you so we care

1334
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,079
we care about the cases that we work on

1335
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,839
we're all going to get a terrible case

1336
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,359
at some point

1337
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,119
in ocean investigations you're all going

1338
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,800
to see something you don't want to see

1339
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,920
it's just part of what it is um but

1340
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,000
ocean is so much fun uh

1341
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,240
i don't ever want this to discourage

1342
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,760
somebody from doing it

1343
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,480
you know one of the most rewarding

1344
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,680
feelings in the world

1345
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,800
is to rescue or find somebody that was

1346
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,760

1408
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,359
websites and apps that i really

1409
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,280
recommend this top one

1410
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,119
shift wellness is one of the trainings

1411
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,480
that are is out there

1412
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,599
for law enforcement primarily meant for

1413
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,599
the icac task forces which is the

1414
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,000
internet crimes against children

1415
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,920
but there are all kinds of videos on

1416
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,160
that website that anybody can view

1417
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,920
um you know you don't have to go through

1418
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,079
their training or be law enforcement

1419
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,319
to view those so and it has you know

1420
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,200
monthly

1421
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,800
newsletters and things that you can also

1422
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,680
look at so it's really great

1423
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,720
the next two are the five four three two

1424
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,520
one and halt

1425
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
techniques that i was talking about

1426
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
earlier so i found

1427
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,599
blog posts on those um breathing

1428
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,359
techniques which are great

1429
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,760
and then these two apps have helped me

1430
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,000
significantly so the calm app

1431
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
um helps with meditation and just

1432
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,839
resetting yourself

1433
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,040
that surf city apps anxiety relief is

1434
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,319
a hypnosis type app

1435
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,200
before you scoff at it i was skeptical

1436
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,839
too

1437
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,839
um but i actually use that one they also

1438
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,000
have a sleep app that works wonders

1439
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,920
the ladies voice in that even if you

1440
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,359
don't believe in hypnosis

1441
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,599
will put you to sleep it's phenomenal

1442
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,960
but the anxiety relief

1443
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,200
really helps step you through a whole

1444
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,160
process

1445
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,319
to get rid of anxiety and i highly

1446
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,559
recommend it

1447
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,040
all right so with that um i think we

1448
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,559
have about five minutes left

1449
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,760
so does anybody have any questions um

1450
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,520
and then in the meantime of course

1451
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,640

and i love all the advice you provide

1460
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,119
and and i'll probably

1461
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,960
have to watch this again to go catch up

1462
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,800
on everything um

1463
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,960
we've got about four minutes and there's

1464
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,240
a question that was asked

1465
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,599
um do you use uh the techniques uh

1466
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,920
second questions are going up hang on um

1467
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,280
there's a question around yeah how do

1468
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,160
you deal with the flashbacks today

1469
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,319
so good question um as soon as i have

1470
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,599
those flashbacks

1471
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,119
i do some of the techniques that we

1472
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,800
talked about i notice

1473
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,480
you know my surroundings you know what

1474
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,000
was it that is giving me that

1475
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,040
flashback um a lot of times it

1476
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,280
i could be walking through a store and

1477
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,280
somebody looks like one of my subjects

1478
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,920
that i was

1479
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,000
you know working on um and so that'll

1480
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,440
trigger a flashback

1481
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,520
and you just have to be mentally aware

1482
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,960
physically aware of what's

1483
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,200
happening in your body and like i said

1484
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,319
to reset that

1485
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,480
you just have to stop that from

1486
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,440
happening so the 54321

1487
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,920
just be present in what you're doing

1488
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,880
look around

1489
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,200
take a deep breath and realize you're

1490
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,480
you're not back in there because

1491
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,720
all those feelings and emotions anger

1492
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,240
you know anxiety comes back

1493
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,480
up um just realize you're not in that

1494
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,079
place you're safe

1495
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,079
the people you investigated are safe and

1496
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,760
it's going to be okay

1497
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,599
and so you just take a deep breath and

1498
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:34,800
you move on

1499
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,640
um you know there's there are nights

1500
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,720
where i wake up um you know i have a

1501
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,400
dream or something about them

1502
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,800
and again it's you know just resetting

1503
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,079
yourself physically

1504
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,480
and just stopping that emotional you

1505
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,319
know chemical dump from happening which

1506
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:48,640
is

1507
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,000
essentially what's going on in your body

1508
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
yeah um and there's lots um

1509
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,280
it's just so many techniques you

1510
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,319
described and actually wasn't aware of

1511
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,440
actually quite a few of those to be
