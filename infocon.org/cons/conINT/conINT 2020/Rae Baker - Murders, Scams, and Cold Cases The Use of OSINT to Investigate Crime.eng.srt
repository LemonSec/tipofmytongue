and cold cases the use of ocean

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:17,920
techniques

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,960
to investigate crime this talk looked

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,480
absolutely amazing to me i was so

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,199
hearts so let's get right into it and

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,640

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,279
hey thanks i hope i can live up to that

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,960
intro

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
so thanks everybody for having me today

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,559
i'm super excited to be a part of

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,520
raising money for both trace labs and nc

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,000
ptf um as you said my talk today is

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
murder scams and cold cases the use of

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
ocean techniques to investigate crime

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
so just a brief intro on me i work as a

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,920
cyber recon analyst for a large

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
consulting firm

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,079
i'm also on the advisory board for osync

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,039
curious

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
and i am the ocean team lead for

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,520
operation safe escape and a volunteer at

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
innocent lives

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,640
i'm not sure where i find the time for

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
all of this but i'm also a trace lab

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,280
senior judge

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,640
and on the design committee

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
so overall i'm not really sure where my

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,520
true crime

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
obsession started i think it probably

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,920
started when i was young and i watched

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,040
unsolved mysteries or

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
a rescue 9-1-1 which was always on when

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,439
i was home

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,000
i've always been fascinated with it um

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,439
before i started in

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,119
infosec i was actually a graphic

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,200
designer for 15 years

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
and i switched to security looking for

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
something more um

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
techy uh something more challenging

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,640
and i went to the larry conference in

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
rhode island and i played in a trace

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,079
labs event

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,360
actually and i realized that

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,960
there was a strange intersection between

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,320
my love for true crime and the

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
technical security stuff that i was

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,679
studying

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,160
um i i quickly realized that open source

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,200
intelligence

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
covered all the stuff that i was really

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
into and that

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,280
i could get paid for it which was really

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
fun

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
um without having to become law

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,840
enforcement

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,760
and that is something that i know

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,040
personally i could not

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,560
ever accomplish so um it was nice to

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,959
find

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,480
some place that i fit so

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,959
since then um my love for true crime has

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
not slowed down at all i keep

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,920
a huge spreadsheet of every podcast

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,640
movie

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,920
tv show that i watch um because i'm

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
afraid of re-watching something

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,480
and um it's grown rather large

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
so before we get into it i just want to

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,480
make it clear that i don't condone any

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,920
sort of like

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
open source intelligence investigation

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
that might impede with law enforcement

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
and a case that they're running um you

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
know it's one thing to research

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,239
it's another two docs information that

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,879
might um screw up a case

86
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
so i also want to say that i might

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,879
insert some things that i think are

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,360
funny

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
or light-hearted but that doesn't really

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,879
mean that

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,720
i'm not taking into account the feelings

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
of the victims of the crimes that i'm

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,159
discussing because they are obviously

94
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,599
the most important part of all of this

95
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,360
and by the way i've hidden a lot of

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
easter eggs in here if you are a true

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,000
crime person

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
um you might be able to pick out which

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,200
shows they're from so keep an eye out

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,518
for that

101
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,120
um some fun true crime facts to start us

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,480
off um

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,560
i i thought it was interesting that 75

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
percent of true crime

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,879
podcast listeners are women um

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,920
which i guess makes sense um

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,159
and the tiger king drew more than 34

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
million viewers in the first

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,400
day of its release or first 10 days of

110
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,360
its release

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
which is a lot of money so it's

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
obviously not going anywhere true crime

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,159
is

114
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
is staying around it's a money maker

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
um the

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
agenda for today now that we can see how

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,759
true crime has

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,519
you know kind of permeated mainstream

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,240
culture it continues to grow

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
the intent of this talk is to kind of

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
dive into open source

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
intelligence and how it's used in

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
crowdsourcing

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,199
the solving of crimes and i also want to

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
dive into the ethical considerations

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,239
that are involved in

127
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
crowdsourcing

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
this is an uh ocean con

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,960
so i don't want to dive too deeply into

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
what ocean is because i'm sure you've

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
heard it all day since i'm

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,479
i think the last person but i do want to

133
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,280
cover it it's very important to

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
define what ocean is and ocean

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,560
is the use of public sources and data

136
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,080
for research so this is social media

137
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,800
public documents public reports voting

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,520
records

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,080
police records um from freedom of

140
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,759
information act

141
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,720
it is not calling the families on the

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,280
phone

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,320
or visiting their house or stalking them

144
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
on social media

145
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,800
or hacking into their systems

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,080
that is not what ozin is about

147
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,680
so we kind of stay in the shadows

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
um it's also important to note here the

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
difference between ocean

150
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,240
and doxing um i think a lot of people

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,440
think they're the same thing and

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
sometimes well-intended

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
web sleuths think they're providing some

154
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
sort of actionable information but and

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
end up doxing innocent people

156
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
so if you're doxing someone you have a

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,360
vested interest in

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
harming them or exposing their

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,199
personal information online for everyone

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,400
to see

161
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
if you are an ocean investigator you're

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,160
staying neutral

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
you you might want to solve the crime

164
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,680
but

165
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
you're limiting information that you're

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,600
leaking out um

167
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
you're not exposing people to the

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
internet

169
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,160
i think that's that's a huge takeaway is

170
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,080
that you don't want to leak any personal

171
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,600
information

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
so ocean and true crime um

173
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
have been intersecting a lot recently um

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,639
i'm sure

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,680
everyone or most of you have seen uh

176
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
don't [ __ ] with cats

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
on netflix and if you haven't it's where

178
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
a bunch of web sleuths on a facebook

179
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
group got together and they started

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
tracking down

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,120
um famous murderer luca magnata who

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
killed a bunch of cats online and

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,520
they found a lot of information on him

184
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,319
another popular ocean investigation that

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,960
has been

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,520
in the media recently was michelle

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
mcnamara's

188
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
search for the golden state killer and

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,520
it was first published as a book

190
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,440
and it made into an hbo series

191
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
called i'll be on in the dark which was

192
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,639
very good

193
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,120
and she had some access to police

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,639
reports but a lot of her work was done

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
using ocean techniques

196
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,479
the the crimes took place in different

197
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,080
districts so

198
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
the police forces didn't really talk to

199
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,199
each other and

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,400
by her um gathering information from

201
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
each of them

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,000
she kind of forced them all to talk and

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,479
and

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,039
assisted in the solving of the crime

205
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,840
and finally i wanted to mention unsolved

206
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,560
mysteries

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,720
and this is not because they use ocean

208
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,599
to solve

209
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
the crimes but are the mysteries but

210
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,199
because the

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,039
the producers actually took all of the

212
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
reports that they gathered and they

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080
dumped them into

214
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
a reddit forum the unsolved mysteries

215
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,120
read it for him

216
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,599
to kind of crowdsource the investigation

217
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
of these after they aired

218
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,280
and note i believe a new season of this

219
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,800
is coming out next week so

220
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,240
keep an eye out for that

221
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,960
um there are both pros and cons to

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,919
crowdsourcing

223
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,440
these types of um information or um

224
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,440
cases there's a whole lot of data

225
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,919
available with social media and and

226
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,279
public documents

227
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,560
and that is great that is definitely a

228
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,040
pro

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,839
but the con side to that is that if you

230
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,200
are one person

231
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
or two or even a few that there's so

232
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,440
much data how do you manage it

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
and how do you structure it and how do

234
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,760
you make sure it's reliable

235
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
um so while crowdsourcing is great it

236
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,360
does have some issues

237
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
you could unknowingly be spreading or

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
ingesting

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
myths or disinformation and there could

240
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
be a lot of ethical considerations

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,839
involved

242
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
so i see a lot of ocean investigations

243
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,519
with between all the volunteering stuff

244
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,800
that i do

245
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
and i've kind of shoved them into four

246
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,480
categories and

247
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,399
this is i'm sure not all of the

248
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,600
categories that

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,120
that they could be but these are the

250
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,720
ones i'm using here

251
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,720
so illegal sales so that would be

252
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
drugs the sale of people things

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
and imagery so that would be your child

254
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,320
exploitation imagery

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
and things like that scams and fraud

256
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
so maybe financial crime or insurance

257
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,839
scams

258
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
i know a lot of osim people who work in

259
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
insurance

260
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
where they track down the people who are

261
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,320
scamming and defrauding

262
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
insurance companies so they they see

263
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,079
that they're

264
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,680
not following through with uh the

265
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
injuries they say that they have

266
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
and real-time crimes so this would be um

267
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
maybe a terrorist attack that happened

268
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
right now and everybody's on twitter

269
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,360
talking about it

270
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,760
and outlining it and figuring out what

271
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,120
happened

272
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,880
maybe a high profile murder or

273
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
kidnapping something that's happening

274
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
right now

275
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,079
and cold cases so this would be

276
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,680
trace lab stuff missing people murders

277
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,600
unsolved mysteries

278
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,880
um things like that i would argue that

279
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,600
there is a

280
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,519
fifth one which would be maybe terrorist

281
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,120
investigations but i'm not really gonna

282
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
go into that

283
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,959
because i think that's a whole nother

284
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
presentation

285
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
so with all these um who is doing these

286
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,839
investigations

287
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,680
uh we still have the law enforcement

288
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
that is working on all these cases

289
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
even if it's a cold case i'm sure there

290
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
are law enforcement um

291
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
people who are working on these hobbyist

292
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,519
web sleuths um people like me before i

293
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,640
got hired

294
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,839
as an ocean analyst you know just poking

295
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,440
around online

296
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
um ocean investigators that work in the

297
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,640
security field

298
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,360
um or maybe came from military or have

299
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
that sort of background and kind of came

300
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,839
into it wasn't that way investigative

301
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,560
journalists

302
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,519
and concerned citizens maybe in your

303
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,959
neighborhood who

304
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,079
are looking for the predators that live

305
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:36,720
nearby

306
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,079
or want to out who's been stealing

307
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
everybody's garbage cans

308
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,200
so when we talk about organized groups

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,760
of

310
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
hobbyist investigators the site web slus

311
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
is the one that immediately comes to my

312
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
mind

313
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
um if you don't know who web slus is

314
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,000
they

315
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
they're a forum and they post cases

316
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
that let you crowds and they kind of

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,880
crowdsource the investigation

318
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
into the case so it's mostly missing

319
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,519
people and

320
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,920
murders as far as i know

321
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,519
and i think a lot of some of them have

322
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,959
been solved through there

323
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,399
um and you can go on and

324
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,760
join and help investigate crimes that

325
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,160
way

326
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,880
it's not really uh policed by anybody

327
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,399
professional but they do

328
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,000
a lot of investigation but that's not

329
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
really the only place you can do

330
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,680
investigations like this we all know

331
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,040
about trace labs

332
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
and read it i wouldn't

333
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,399
say that all of their reddit pages are

334
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,639
good but some some are at least

335
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,000
interesting as a way to

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,079
spark an idea on what you can

337
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
investigate like scam slayers people

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,519
post

339
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,279
scams that they found and maybe that's

340
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,440
something you can investigate for a blog

341
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,480
or whatever to hone your skills

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,200
um there's discord channels like

343
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
searchlight that

344
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,680
that you can go on and you can pitch an

345
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
investigation or join in on an

346
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
investigation

347
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,079
and there's slack slack channels that

348
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,320
kind of do the same thing

349
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,639
and twitter you can follow like the live

350
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,250
real-time

351
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,320
[Music]

352
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,760
um crimes that are going on like eric

353
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
in this screenshot um he was looking for

354
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,279
help

355
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,320
so a bunch of uh analysts jumped on and

356
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
helped him with some details so that was

357
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,600
really cool to see

358
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,560
unfolding live

359
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
uh we need to know the legal and ethical

360
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
considerations

361
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,440
for investigations like this so

362
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
there's always always safety impacts

363
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
so if you are investigating even if you

364
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,519
kind of go rogue on

365
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,560
one of the trace labs missing people and

366
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,800
you want to keep investigating them

367
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,000
you don't know if they're in a gang

368
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
like what's gonna happen uh you don't

369
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
really have the backing of the

370
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
organization

371
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,880
to make sure you're safe um there could

372
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
be real world impact on the case you

373
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,199
could

374
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,920
um post something or caused the case to

375
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,639
be

376
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,880
damaged or closed

377
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,519
you could impact the victims or the

378
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,240
families

379
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
if you somehow leaked some information

380
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,079
to them that they weren't supposed to

381
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,360
have

382
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
or didn't know you don't know what

383
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,079
you're opening up there

384
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,279
there's a huge potential for

385
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
misinformation to be spread

386
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
if you're sharing your case with other

387
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
people and they post it online maybe

388
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,279
they don't have the same ethics that you

389
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
do but you shared it with them

390
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
um these are all things to be like

391
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
conscious of when you're doing an

392
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
investigation like this

393
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,639
crossing the ocean boundary is a big one

394
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,279
if you are really deep into a case and

395
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,160
it's a

396
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
child exploitation case and you know

397
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
something is on somebody's computer and

398
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,079
you could just

399
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
i don't know reset their password and or

400
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,399
pull it from breach data and

401
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,959
and find the images i mean that's

402
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,120
crossing the boundary

403
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
that's that's uh that's somebody else's

404
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,639
job um

405
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,320
you don't want to cross that boundary

406
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,560
you want to stay in the public

407
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,880
public documents and in the safe area

408
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
and then finally legal ramifications for

409
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
viewing and storing content

410
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,079
again if you're looking into things like

411
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,160
child exploitation

412
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,880
you have to be aware of what you're

413
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
looking at what is being saved on your

414
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,360
computer

415
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,320
in your history if you're using

416
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,199
something like

417
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,240
hunchley or vortemo and it's saving the

418
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
things that you're looking at

419
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,000
you don't know what's legal in your area

420
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,880
just be very mindful that i know a lot

421
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
of people like to do

422
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,680
child cases it's very important to a lot

423
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,040
of people

424
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,759
but it's also very dangerous and if you

425
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,720
don't have the backing of an

426
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,680
organization

427
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,519
to make sure you're safe or blurring

428
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,959
content

429
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,479
it can get dicey

430
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
so mental health is a huge issue and i

431
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,959
know a lot of other people have touched

432
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,639
on that today but

433
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,720
i also need to touch on it because i

434
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,399
find it very important

435
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,320
um if you know michelle mcnamara's story

436
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,519
at all from

437
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,399
her book you know that the golden state

438
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,320
killer investigation took a huge toll on

439
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
her mental health

440
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
she was taking drugs to go to sleep

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,279
because she

442
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,720
was thinking of nothing but the golden

443
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
state killer and then she was taking

444
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,600
drugs to stay alert

445
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
during the day because she was so tired

446
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
and she had a heart condition and it

447
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
ended up leading to her death before her

448
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,680
book was

449
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,040
published i think it's

450
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
super easy to get attached to victims in

451
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,639
these types of cases

452
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,079
missing people murder cp cases

453
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
and feel like you kind of owe it to them

454
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,399
to solve it

455
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,839
and you can get pulled in really easily

456
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
so it is very important to keep in

457
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,280
contact with a mental health

458
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,640
professional

459
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
if you take on cases like this it's a

460
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,760
really good idea

461
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,359
oftentimes volunteer organizations will

462
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,000
require

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,439
that you meet with a professional on a

464
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
regular basis just to make sure that you

465
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,640
are

466
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,959
okay

467
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,919
so to be a valuable ocean investigator

468
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,640
it

469
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,039
kind of requires the development of a

470
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,400
certain skill set

471
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
um some of these i've listed here that

472
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
might be helpful

473
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,840
you know being curious the ability to

474
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,640
identify

475
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
some kind of useful intelligence and

476
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,640
create a case out of it

477
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,559
uh to be an ocean investigator who

478
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
researches crime

479
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
um you need to focus on your mental

480
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,880
health while you're doing it

481
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,960
definitely know the laws what you can

482
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,520
view and what you can't view

483
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,600
know that ocean means no engagement

484
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,799
and definitely know when to stop um

485
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,000
you can get sucked into these cases and

486
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
search through them endlessly um and

487
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
that goes back to mental health so it's

488
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,039
just good to like check in with yourself

489
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:28,080
and um make sure you you're good

490
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
at this point i think it's it's a good

491
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
idea to talk about some of the good

492
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,760
um and bad of internet justice some good

493
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,520
things that happened and some very bad

494
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,720
things

495
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,840
um starting with the image on the left

496
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,160
so

497
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,559
this was an image that was pulled from i

498
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,520
think google earth

499
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
someone reported it to the police as a

500
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,760
murder

501
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
turns out it was actually just a wet dog

502
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,520
that

503
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,559
went swimming and walked across and

504
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,880
laid there for a little bit and that's

505
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,080
that's a funny one

506
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
um but it did take police time and they

507
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
had to investigate it

508
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,679
and so it's it's interesting to see how

509
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,480
quickly something so mundane can turn

510
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,039
into

511
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,080
something like murder you know and

512
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,919
and pull police resources so it's very

513
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,000
good to know that what you're presenting

514
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
is actual fact um

515
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,120
on the good side we have the doe network

516
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
i believe they're all volunteers at the

517
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
doe network to um

518
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,240
figure out who the uh the unnamed people

519
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
are that they found

520
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,120
the unidentified people um

521
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,760
grateful doe was someone who was

522
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,520
identified 20 years

523
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,720
after she was found dead so

524
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,640
they i don't think that was the dough

525
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,039
network but

526
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,559
she was identified um

527
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,280
and then on the bad side if we switch

528
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
back to that

529
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,679
we have joshua ryan goldberg so

530
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
this was a guy who

531
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,320
online he created a bunch of stock

532
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
accounts and

533
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,159
each sock was a different he was trying

534
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,360
to draw people in

535
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,679
criminals in so one was a racist you

536
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,120
know one was

537
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,080
a terrorist sympathizer and he had all

538
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,799
of these sock accounts and he was

539
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,840
posting trying to get people to comment

540
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
and give him information

541
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,080
he ended up talking with an fbi

542
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
informant

543
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,440
who said that he wanted to create a bomb

544
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
and um goldberg actually gave him

545
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,799
instructions to create a bomb

546
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,000
and then he was arrested and now he has

547
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,679
i think 20 years in jail yeah 20 years

548
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,280
in prison

549
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,679
um he said that he just wanted to be a

550
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,480
journalist

551
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,559
and he thought it would be impressive if

552
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,000
he

553
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,159
could trap somebody in that sort of

554
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
situation

555
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,200
so that's a very bad way to use

556
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,159
investigation

557
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,240
and stock accounts and stuff like that

558
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
and then the one that stands out to me

559
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,799
as the biggest

560
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,799
failure of ocean is the reddit witch

561
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,280
hunt during the boston marathon bombing

562
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,799
if you remember the boston marathon

563
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
bombing immediately afterwards

564
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,159
the video and the photos were being

565
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,039
examined by reddit reddit went crazy

566
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,000
they started speculating and identifying

567
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,919
a bunch of people

568
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,679
um who created supposedly the bomb

569
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,840
um they misidentified people um

570
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,080
and i it went viral and

571
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,120
there was just a whole issue around it

572
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
and that they were not the people that

573
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,440
actually

574
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,799
created the bomb or set it off

575
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
um so that was i think reddit got sued

576
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,559
for it they had to issue

577
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
a public apology it was a huge thing a

578
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,559
few years ago

579
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,520
so now that we've gone over all that we

580
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,000
can

581
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,480
get started into how to investigate

582
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
these types of crimes

583
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
so it's important to kind of establish

584
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
best practices for tackling each

585
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,679
type because they each have their own

586
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
like nuances and tactics so i want to

587
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,280
touch on a few and give some suggestions

588
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
again i know this is kind of an ocean

589
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,559
con but i'm going to go over my

590
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,159
basic methodology um i

591
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,799
think that most ozon investigations kind

592
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,799
of follow the same

593
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,679
vibe here so starts with a collection

594
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,200
phase so that's when you would go out

595
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
and you'd collect

596
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,240
usernames people affiliated

597
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,600
public documents whatever you can that

598
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
relates to what you're looking for

599
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,720
and and actually before you start this

600
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,120
you would want to set up scope

601
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
where are you going to stop what is your

602
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,120
goal what do you want to collect

603
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,760
and find out of this investigation so

604
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
once you establish that and you start

605
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,158
collecting stuff

606
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
you could collect forever but you have

607
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,840
to kind of stop yourself and start

608
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,799
analyzing it

609
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,799
and that's that's what i consider the

610
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
second phase so when you're analyzing

611
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,520
the information and you're

612
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,360
looking through it all and putting it

613
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,559
together like a puzzle

614
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,000
you can see where the holes are

615
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
and at that point you're gonna be sent

616
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,679
back to the collection phase and i think

617
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,280
this kind of goes around in a circle

618
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
where you're analyzing and collecting um

619
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,039
again endlessly until you decide that

620
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,559
you're ready to start reporting

621
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,080
when you think you have enough

622
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,279
information you can start reporting

623
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,640
and again at that point you're going to

624
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,080
see holes in your investigation and

625
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,200
you're going to get kicked back to

626
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
collecting and analyzing

627
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,559
and that's why it's so good to set a

628
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,720
scope ahead of time so you know where to

629
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
stop where

630
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,639
where is the end point

631
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,400
so some things that are good to know

632
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
for each of these areas that i outlined

633
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,440
earlier

634
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,159
i'm not going to read all of these but

635
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,720
for instance if you are looking into

636
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,159
things like illegal sales you do

637
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,640
obviously want some dark web experience

638
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,960
probably to know the code words they use

639
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,840
but be good at looking up usernames and

640
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
matching usernames

641
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,840
and investigating telegram and kik

642
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,640
if you're looking into scams and frauds

643
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
i would think you'd want to start more

644
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,360
with

645
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,799
contracts open corporates little sis um

646
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,919
who is information tax records maybe

647
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,840
some bitcoin experience

648
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
um i know bellycat has a good newsletter

649
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
for bitcoin

650
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,880
um real time crime it's good to have

651
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
like geolocation experience maybe quiz

652
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,159
time

653
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,799
um be able to research hashtags

654
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,480
maybe visualize things um

655
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,679
pick out miss and dis info um

656
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,679
look up criminal records and user names

657
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,000
and the way accounts link together so

658
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
you can track more people down and

659
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
and i think visualization for this is

660
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
very important because oftentimes these

661
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,679
crimes happen so fast

662
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,440
and you want to see the whole landscape

663
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,200
of what is going on

664
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,240
and using twitter and their api you can

665
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
often

666
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,960
visualize all that and then

667
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,279
cold cases this would be your missing

668
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,440
people so

669
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,640
uh usernames again super important

670
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,159
because most of these missing people

671
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,480
are young kids and they have 400

672
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,840
instagram accounts

673
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,320
and you have to be able to link them all

674
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,120
um

675
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,799
figuring out friends and family and

676
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,480
who's talking to who and

677
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,320
which one of the family members is the

678
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,919
talker you know there's always one that

679
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,919
talks on social media

680
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,320
um voting records being able to look up

681
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,400
voting records by state and see

682
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,320
you can get addresses and phone numbers

683
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
and

684
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,640
party information and

685
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,159
definitely any kind of social media

686
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,520
research is good to have

687
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
so now i have a few examples

688
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,559
so for the illegal sales if you haven't

689
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,640
seen or listened to a hunting moorhead

690
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
podcast it is really dark

691
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,880
but it's really really good um it's a

692
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,919
a podcast series about

693
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,919
uh i believe a white hat hacker and a

694
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,760
journalist and they kind of

695
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,559
um happen upon this very large child

696
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,600
abuse ring

697
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,679
and they go to australia to confront the

698
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,440
two men who are running it on the dark

699
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
web

700
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,120
and it is it's a very good story and

701
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,360
worth your time

702
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,159
um on the other side here i found a

703
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,200
similar story

704
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,720
about um feds taking down a large dark

705
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,279
web

706
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,760
child porn marketplace which was

707
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,799
actually found by

708
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,400
an irs service agent who would notice

709
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,679
the sites

710
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,000
had misconfigured the site uh the

711
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,520
administrator

712
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
and it revealed the identity of the

713
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,200
owner and they they tracked it down that

714
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,039
way which was pretty interesting

715
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,799
and i have all of these um urls at the

716
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,480
end of my presentation if you

717
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,720
look it up you can read the actual

718
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
reports

719
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,200
scams and frauds so this is actually my

720
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
favorite

721
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
um i wrote a blog on a puppy scam so i

722
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,000
included it here you can read it or not

723
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,200
um i have been tracking this puppy

724
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,840
scammer

725
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,880
across three continents um she does not

726
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,760
stop

727
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,880
she has she sells puppies for ten

728
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,120
thousand dollars a piece

729
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
people buy them you'd be surprised they

730
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,360
send they wire money ten thousand

731
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,480
dollars

732
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,600
um having never met this dog they wire

733
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,240
money for

734
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,159
like little teacup dogs and they don't

735
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,360
exist

736
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,919
and then she just takes the money and

737
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,120
there are

738
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
hundreds of people who have been scammed

739
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,799
by her and she pulls other scams to

740
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,399
credit cards and stuff

741
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,919
um so so i wrote up a blog about it

742
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,960
um and it's

743
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
it's never ending it's very interesting

744
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
um so you can check that one out um

745
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,360
also long distance reply all if you have

746
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,760
not

747
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
listened to reply all it is a great

748
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,279
podcast

749
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,159
um in this episode they actually alex

750
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:44,799
goldman

751
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
got a phone call from a telephone

752
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,240
scammer

753
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,320
that said he had suspicious icloud

754
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,279
activity

755
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,039
and they pretended that they were apple

756
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,360
tech support i believe

757
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,559
and they end up talking back and forth

758
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
and he kind of puts together

759
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,960
the pieces of this call center and who's

760
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,159
in charge and

761
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
he tracks them they actually fly to

762
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,440
their country

763
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,360
um i don't remember which country it is

764
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,720
but they fly there

765
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,399
and they track them down in person they

766
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,840
have a picture of them all together

767
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
it's it's really interesting um

768
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,840
and another scam fraud example i found

769
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,320
was

770
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,320
this brother wristwatch so this guy

771
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,440
he was photographed at a car accident a

772
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
fatal car accident

773
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,399
um smiling or laughing and it

774
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,320
outraged um chinese so they

775
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,279
identified him

776
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,000
and his watch collection so that's the

777
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,440
picture with the numbers is all his

778
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
different watches

779
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,640
so then they realized that he has all

780
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,279
these huge expensive expensive watches

781
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,159
like 11 of them and they deemed that

782
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:52,720
they

783
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,399
cost too much for a public servant in

784
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,760
his position

785
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,640
and he was actually arrested for

786
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,440
corruption

787
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,880
because i guess he was stealing money

788
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,039
uh real-time crime examples so

789
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,320
um recently bellingcat did

790
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,600
um an article on the firework

791
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,880
explosion in beirut and

792
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,360
in this article they did a great job of

793
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,880
tracking down the warehouse

794
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,919
and they link the windows with

795
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,520
in one photo the windows in the other

796
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,440
photo and they link the

797
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,159
roof and they kind of lay it all out for

798
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,679
you and it's very

799
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,760
easy to understand and it's a good

800
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,150
intro to kind of

801
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,039
[Music]

802
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,399
locating and matching photographs

803
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,240
and then benjamin strick which i hope

804
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,600
you guys all watched this morning

805
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,720
he posted this uh in august

806
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,840
it was a group of young cadets in libya

807
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
were hit by a strike and no one claimed

808
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
responsibility

809
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,679
and they tracked the missile

810
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,159
parts from the explosion to the actual

811
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:06,960
missile and

812
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,200
they figured out what it was they found

813
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,240
out that

814
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,880
um they found an arms registry and they

815
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,159
found out that the

816
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,840
drones could be flat packed into these

817
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,880
containers and then they found the

818
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,120
satellite pictures of the containers

819
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,000
and they were the same size and color

820
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,559
and in the same area

821
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,159
so that's that's a great um

822
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,440
intro to how to you know match pieces of

823
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,360
things from one photograph to the next

824
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
and how to track it through whole

825
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
investigation

826
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
um so definitely check that one out in

827
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,080
the links

828
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
at the end of my presentation because

829
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,840
that's a good one

830
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,399
and then cold case examples uh this one

831
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,799
on the left is another belling cat

832
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,279
but it is i believe from trade yeah your

833
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,799
poultry is an object so

834
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,600
those are open to everyone they usually

835
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,720
post like a shirt

836
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,240
or something in the background of a

837
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,720
picture and they cut the child out it's

838
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:04,960
a

839
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,760
like child exploitation imagery and they

840
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
want to track down

841
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,320
where the thing was purchased or where

842
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,880
the people are located in the picture

843
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
um so they went through this

844
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,399
investigation and they showed how they

845
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,600
tracked

846
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,039
by landscape and fences um the exact

847
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,799
location that that picture was taken

848
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,600
with the child in it

849
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
now missing people that really

850
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,720
correlates

851
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,919
if you are doing these trace lab events

852
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,320
and you are into um tracking down

853
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
missing children

854
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,640
knowing these skills are it's very

855
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,360
important so

856
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,880
trace an object is a good way to um

857
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,600
hone those skills i also included the

858
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,120
golden state killer because it was a

859
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,519
very

860
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,360
long i think it was over

861
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,399
17 years or 16 years this guy was

862
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,519
missing

863
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,840
and they couldn't find him and you know

864
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,880
she tracked him down

865
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,559
using ocean um

866
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,039
and then this this researcher on the

867
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
bottom she was a web sleuth

868
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,360
a guy got into a bus and

869
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,480
i think he had dementia and he never

870
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
was seen again and this web sleuth

871
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,960
she found an article where a

872
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,919
man's remains were found and she pieced

873
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,039
it all together

874
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,720
and um found out for his family that

875
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,880
days after he was reported missing that

876
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,240
they found this body

877
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
and it ended up being him so she could

878
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,399
put closure to his family for that

879
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,000
so now how can you help

880
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,799
um now that you've seen all these ways

881
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,399
that you can

882
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,159
investigate how can you actually put

883
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,559
that into action

884
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,039
we all know trace labs search party

885
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,000
tomorrow

886
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,679
i'm going to be playing definitely

887
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,080
playing that i hope you all are too

888
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,240
trace labs also has a trello board with

889
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,679
ongoing cases

890
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,399
definitely check that one out operation

891
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,280
safe escape

892
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,760
is always looking for volunteers um not

893
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
just osim volunteers

894
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,079
um digital forensics all sorts of things

895
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,159
marketing you know

896
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,918
basically apply for anything you're into

897
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,440
and see if you fit

898
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,079
um innocent lives foundation is a great

899
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,599
way to help i know they're invite only

900
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,480
right now

901
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,639
but keep an eye on them if not you can

902
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,239
always donate to them

903
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,599
and help them out

904
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,320
and europol trace an object i just

905
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,159
mentioned

906
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,520
they post i mean they have a website of

907
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,960
imagery that you can you can try and

908
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,520
find and locate the the items the shirts

909
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,560
and

910
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
things in the background and ncptf

911
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,679
obviously

912
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,720
so how can you

913
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,880
make all of this stuff legitimate how

914
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
can you become a legitimate

915
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,720
ocean investigator you can practice

916
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,880
that goes without saying really um the

917
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,079
more you do it the better you're going

918
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,720
to be at it

919
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,480
um the more you do these search party

920
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
events um the more you just play around

921
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,119
with scams

922
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,960
looking yourself up the better you'll be

923
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,680
you can take courses tracelabs has all

924
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,400
these courses i've seen combine

925
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,680
the dark web courses those all help and

926
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,480
inspire you if you if you don't know

927
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,079
where to start

928
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,440
and and obviously um joe's joe gray's

929
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200
classes too

930
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,160
uh write blogs that's how i started i

931
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,560
just

932
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,040
started by picking some things that i

933
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,800
wanted to investigate

934
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,520
and just writing about it writing it

935
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,119
like i was writing to somebody who had

936
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,680
no idea what they were doing

937
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
and it wasn't really for anybody else it

938
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,200
was for me but

939
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,640
um you know sometimes and people

940
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,359
don't always

941
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,920
know people don't always realize how

942
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
important things like that are

943
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
um because you think that you don't know

944
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,200
a lot but

945
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,320
you oftentimes knows more than somebody

946
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,880
else

947
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
so they'll learn from you as well so

948
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,079
it's good to put that stuff back out

949
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,000
into the community

950
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,440
um learning methodology um

951
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,640
everybody kind of has their own

952
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,880
methodology so

953
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,560
follow a few people who you

954
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,720
see doing what you want to be doing see

955
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,839
what they do

956
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,740
and then kind of vary it to

957
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,960
[Music]

958
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,480
what makes sense for you you can build a

959
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,400
relationship with law enforcement

960
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
um if things like missing people are

961
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,480
what you want to focus on definitely

962
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:48,880
that

963
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,160
having that relationship is good

964
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,000
um and and just do research just

965
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,040
i mean if you're into airplanes

966
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,440
start tracking airplanes just do

967
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,400
research whatever

968
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,079
interests you

969
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,280
so the future i see in ocean and

970
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,400
true crime is

971
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
that i think more untrained ocean people

972
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,079
are going to enter the field because

973
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,240
they're going to see

974
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,760
these cool shows on netflix like

975
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,280
don't [ __ ] with cats and they're going

976
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,839
to be intrigued and it's not a bad thing

977
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,680
that's great um i think more entry level

978
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,440
oh some people are going to get trained

979
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,839
to be better at ocean i think there's

980
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,920
going to be an influx of people

981
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,839
and with so much data

982
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,119
it's going to be needed but

983
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,200
i think law enforcement is also going to

984
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,960
start

985
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
increasing the acceptance of internet's

986
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,880
help

987
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,000
that sometimes the crowdsourcing it does

988
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,800
make their job

989
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
a little easier sometimes harder

990
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
i think overall internet abuse laws are

991
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,240
going to change

992
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,800
the more it becomes a an issue at the

993
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,760
forefront

994
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,880
the more they're going to have to pay

995
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,640
attention to it and adjust laws for it

996
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,520
things like ai are going to be used on

997
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,640
social media

998
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
to prevent things like mass violence

999
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,560
they're going to pull out words that

1000
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,680
indicate that someone might shoot up a

1001
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,400
school or something and they will

1002
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
be able to track them that way and

1003
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,839
indicate that they might be a potential

1004
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
risk

1005
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,359
and i think sentiment and analysis will

1006
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,560
increase that way i think that

1007
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,960
not only law enforcement will use that

1008
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,599
but i think

1009
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,160
brands will use that they already kind

1010
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,720
of do on facebook and social media

1011
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
and they're going to track everything

1012
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,040
you say

1013
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,359
so my final thoughts on uh

1014
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,560
true crime and ocean is that definitely

1015
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,480
if you are into

1016
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,560
um hunting down crime

1017
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,520
it's not a bad thing to to use your

1018
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,480
skills to

1019
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,520
help people as long as you know the

1020
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,880
boundaries that you shouldn't cross

1021
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,920
make sure you have a methodology and you

1022
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
can

1023
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,400
you know where to start and where to end

1024
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
definitely seek out the help of people

1025
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,920
who have been doing this for a while

1026
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,800
the yosen community is so open and

1027
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,400
helpful

1028
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,560
definitely hit up people who who know

1029
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
what they're doing

1030
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,240
and they will more than likely help you

1031
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,800
on your

1032
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
journey

1033
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,880
and finally stay sexy and don't get

1034
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,720
murdered

1035
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720

so one question has come in i'm trying

1068
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,880
to do that i was going to now also say

1069
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,160
thank you for the work to the community

1070
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,119
that's all i was going to say and then

1071
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,599
i'm going to be

1072
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,839
quiet again so when questions come in

1073
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,359
at some point you were talking about

1074
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,800
watching out for falling at the rabbit

1075
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
holes

1076
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,160
how do you prevent that i think having

1077
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,720
mostly having people that you can bounce

1078
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,839
ideas off of help

1079
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,480
helps me personally because if i start

1080
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,079
getting into a rabbit hole and i'm

1081
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:34,800
working

1082
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
with someone else or someone else who

1083
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
does ocean or

1084
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,599
that i trust i can shoot it over to them

1085
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,200
and then they say like that

1086
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,880
you're going a little too deep into that

1087
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,839
switch to something else or maybe take a

1088
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,160
break

1089
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,880
that has helped me or if i feel like i'm

1090
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,440
getting too

1091
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,440
into it um i will just stop for a while

1092
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
and then i mean sometimes i'll have a

1093
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
million tabs open on my computer and i

1094
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,200
will just stare at them and just

1095
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,520
nuke it all and then it forces me to

1096
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,599
start over

1097
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,200
and that's terrifying but also very

1098
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,598
helpful

1099
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,280

1100
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,160

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,319
