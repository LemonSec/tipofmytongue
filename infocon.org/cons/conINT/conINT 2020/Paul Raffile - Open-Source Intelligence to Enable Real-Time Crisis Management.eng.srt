for paul

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,679
raphael for open source intelligence to

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,240
enable

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,679
real-time crisis mantra i've been

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,880
actually really looking forward to this

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,400

um all of us together for this awesome

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
day of opportunities and trainings and

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,320
uh gaining so much more information so

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,840
happy to share with everyone today

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
um kind of a unique use of open source

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,239
intelligence i know we got some folks

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,840
talking about investigations

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
analysis um today i kind of want to

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
shift the discussion towards uh using

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
real time or near real-time

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
um open source intelligence to help gain

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
a better understanding of emergent

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,440
crisis

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,920
um as they occur we're going to focus

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,360
this presentation today on

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,000
global crises so um usually

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
international cases i'm based in the us

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,800
but uh

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,519
um we'll cover cases from around the

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,040
world and how even

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,400
um one person sitting at a desk 3 000

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
or 10 000 miles away can gain a um

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
real-time on the ground advantage um

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
seeing what's happening in near real

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,880
time

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,159
so let's go ahead and get started

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,680
all right just a little bit about myself

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
my name is paul raphael my background

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
i'm an

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,479
intelligence analyst by trade i've

45
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
worked in private sector

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,520
and also on a few government projects um

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
i was a lead analyst at a fortune 500

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,320
pharma where we covered everything from

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,119
geopolitical analysis crisis management

50
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,640
travel security so

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
i'm going to share some cool case

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
studies from that experience in my

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,720
background today

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,960
um so yeah private sector intelligence

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
analyst analysis is pretty cool

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,720
um a lot of similarities with

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
what you normally think of as an

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
intelligence analyst on the government

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
side so

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
oftentimes we use the same tools the

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,960
same analytic techniques

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
and uh hopefully i can share some of

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,719
those with you all today

64
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
and then a few qualifications over on

65
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,919
this slide so um

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,440
that'll give some more background about

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
me and why i'm presenting on this topic

68
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
today

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
all right so just a quick rundown um

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
pretty much we're gonna start with

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
defining open source intelligence really

72
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
quickly i think we've just got one slide

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
on that because this entire conference

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,760
is about intelligence so

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,040
i think by this point we have a pretty

76
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,599
good understanding then we'll jump right

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,280
into intelligence driven crisis

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,080
management

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,519
and primarily what we're going to focus

80
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
on is using um real-time signals in

81
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
order to develop that

82
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
better situational awareness better

83
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
context about

84
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
crises that are occurring on the ground

85
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
in real time

86
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
then i also do want to talk about

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,840
vetting and verifying information

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
as you all know social media open

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,319
sources they're known to be not the most

90
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,360
reliable sources

91
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,519
at times so i'll give you some tools to

92
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
help um

93
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
identify potential disinformation

94
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,400
misinformation

95
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,319
and how you can really validate and vet

96
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,680
information

97
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
before you do anything with it and then

98
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,080
lastly we'll just add some

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
few tips and tricks about using ocean to

100
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
enhance other aspects

101
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,800
of international crisis monitoring all

102
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,159
right so let's just

103
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,800
jump right into it um these tools are

104
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
pretty much accessible to everyone well

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
they are accessible to everyone um

106
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,239
totally free online tools that we're

107
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,000
gonna discuss today

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
and anyone is really open to use these

109
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,040
tools

110
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
um you know this presentation may be

111
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
especially beneficial to crisis managers

112
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
security and intelligence analysts watch

113
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,319
officers and journalists

114
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,239
but also this presentation could totally

115
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,840
be used by travelers

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
financial analysts disinformation

117
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,000
warriors and even just curious minds if

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,799
you

119
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,400
um want to develop a better

120
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
understanding in real time maybe before

121
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,080
incidents even break the news

122
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
uh we'll give all those tools out today

123
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
so uh

124
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
it's really for anyone all right so just

125
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
a quick background on open source

126
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,519
intelligence i think everybody knows

127
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,959
by this point in the conference that

128
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,560
osint refers to

129
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
information collected from publicly

130
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,599
accessible sources

131
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,879
so um i use this in contrast to

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
what we typically think of as

133
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,000
traditional intelligence

134
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
gathering disciplines so sigint massen

135
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,918
geoint human

136
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,358
a lot of these are military and

137
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,440
government terms but open source

138
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
intelligence ocean has really been

139
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
accessible to

140
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,600
anyone in any type of job

141
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
i do like to add that um osent in my

142
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
view um i kind of take the idea that um

143
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,919
especially as we talk about it in this

144
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,240
presentation open source intelligence is

145
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
almost the new type of

146
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,840
secant or signals intelligence so

147
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
historically with military and

148
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,840
government

149
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,320
operations they would use signals um

150
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,360
that are

151
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
basically you know tripwires or other

152
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
types of um

153
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
just signals around the world in order

154
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
to develop information about what was

155
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,720
happening

156
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,320
but nowadays we can really use social

157
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
media and open source intelligence to

158
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
um to leverage that same fidelity and

159
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
context of information on the ground so

160
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,520
really open source and social media

161
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
intelligence is the new signals

162
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
intelligence in my view

163
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
so open source and intelligence takes

164
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
all shapes and sizes um you know these

165
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,479
can range from public records to

166
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,039
uh peer-reviewed reports and articles

167
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,919
news media

168
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,280
government alerts especially in the

169
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
context of crisis management

170
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,800
and of course as we already talked about

171
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
social media so use all of these at your

172
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
disposal today we are going to typically

173
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
talk about social media

174
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,440
um but of course you can use all of

175
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,160
these in

176
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
open source intelligence all right so

177
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
let's kind of gear the conversation now

178
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
towards uh the topic of the day

179
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
crisis management so osun can

180
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
really enrich international crisis

181
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
management programs

182
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,039
um it's a hugely valuable tool um that

183
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,720
you can use to assess global risks and

184
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,960
gain more information about those risks

185
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,639
so ocean can help you track things in

186
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
real time it can help you enhance that

187
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
situation awareness

188
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
and improve um your crisis

189
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
responsibilities especially if you're in

190
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
a position in your job

191
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,319
where you're a crisis manager or

192
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,000
security analyst

193
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
you can definitely use osint to gain a

194
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,479
better on-the-ground advantage

195
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,720
so i kind of laid out on the slide four

196
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,199
different um swim lanes where ocean can

197
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,560
really apply but today we're really

198
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,840
going to focus on that situational

199
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
awareness piece where we're going to

200
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,280
talk

201
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,080
talk about real-time intel situation

202
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,520
updates as they occur

203
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
and also how that information can help

204
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,679
with your own contingency planning

205
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
all right so open source intel is

206
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,680
available for all types of global crises

207
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
we can talk about security incidents

208
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
health incidents

209
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,840
outbreaks diseases uh severe weather

210
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,960
um that's coming up protests

211
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,520
natural disasters and even a wide scale

212
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,479
travel incidents

213
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,280
so all these types of global crises

214
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,840
there are

215
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,759
always always always open source

216
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
indicators um

217
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,080
that pretty much give advanced notice to

218
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
most of these incidents

219
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
and then i wanted to use this slide to

220
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,599
really break down

221
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,360
information versus intelligence because

222
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,199
sometimes we get these confused

223
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,919
um information can include a lot of

224
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,479
things

225
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,400
um but intelligence is really

226
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,360
specifically tailored curated

227
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
information that went through a level of

228
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,479
processing

229
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,479
that went through a level of analysis

230
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
and the real point of intelligence is

231
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,000
for it to be actionable

232
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
so while information can basically

233
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
constitute the entire body of knowledge

234
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,199
on a subject

235
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,080
intelligence really is that honed in

236
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,120
specific

237
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,800
actionable information that you need to

238
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
know about a situation which i think is

239
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,919
incredibly pertinent

240
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,039
when we're talking about crises because

241
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
during a crisis and when minutes matter

242
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,520
um really actionable intelligence is

243
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,280
super important so i wanted to start

244
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,680
with

245
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
a um incident reporting time variance

246
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,360
study

247
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
um that my team did so we looked at um

248
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,639
when are mainstream media news stations

249
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,639
um reporting breaking news about an

250
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,520
incident versus when is the first kind

251
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,759
of

252
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,160
open source risk intelligence alert

253
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,039
about

254
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
an incident so we did is we compared the

255
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,720
two we looked at the same incidents that

256
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,199
were reported on both types of platforms

257
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,639
and then we compared all right which one

258
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,960
is breaking the news quicker

259
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,440
and i think you guys can probably guess

260
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,319
that we found

261
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,280
the intelligence alerts had a huge

262
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,000
advantage

263
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
um when it comes to timeliness and

264
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,199
reporting breaking

265
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,399
uh global incidents so

266
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,880
um as you can see by this chart a lot of

267
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,000
examples where

268
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,799
um the intelligence alerting had a major

269
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,599
time advantage over breaking news alert

270
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
um there were four instances in our

271
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
study when the breaking news

272
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,839
alert did come before the intelligence

273
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,880
alert so

274
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,360
kudos on those incidents but um you can

275
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
definitely see how

276
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,320
that having a robust intelligence

277
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,480
collection and processing system

278
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
um can help you gain that real-time

279
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,279
advantage especially when minutes matter

280
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
um so yeah just picking out a few

281
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
examples um

282
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,200
from this slide so uh the first live

283
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
shot that was fired in the hong kong

284
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
protests uh back in quarter four 2019

285
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
um that was reported uh almost six hours

286
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,279
in advance uh from an intelligence alert

287
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
before breaking news actually reported

288
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,000
that incident

289
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
and that's important because um that

290
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
first live shot in the hong kong

291
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,800
protests

292
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,279
um drastically escalated the situation

293
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,560
i'm sure you guys remember the news

294
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
reports of millions of people gathering

295
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
in the streets

296
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,839
after that first live shot was fired um

297
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,040
things did escalate

298
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
lots more people a lot more violence so

299
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,959
it's important to know

300
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,080
um incidents in real time before they're

301
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
even

302
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
alerted on by breaking news then another

303
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,839
interesting example here we basically

304
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,640
had

305
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
a three full day advance notice um when

306
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
british airways was cancelling about 90

307
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,320
of their flights back in september um on

308
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
one weekend

309
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
due to a workers strike um so

310
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
just knowing that information three days

311
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
in advance before mainstream media even

312
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,920
reported on it

313
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,279
um that's huge especially if you're

314
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,399
traveling with the company you don't

315
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,079
want to get stranded abroad or anything

316
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,120
like that

317
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
um so yeah this can really range in

318
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
anything from travel incidents

319
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,920
health outbreaks uh security incidents

320
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,000
protests etc

321
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
and then one more slide on this topic uh

322
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
we added a few more down at the bottom

323
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
at the end of our study

324
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,519
and it turned out that um we received an

325
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,399
alert about

326
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,279
uh coven 19 almost nine days in advance

327
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,440
before it even hit the first

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
major international or u.s mainstream

329
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,279
news publication

330
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,360
so imagine just having that advantage

331
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,320
that there was

332
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,839
the knowledge that there was a viral

333
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,680
outbreak it seems to be getting worse it

334
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
seems to be

335
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
abnormal and it doesn't seem to be

336
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
contained so

337
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
imagine what that nine-day advantage

338
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
would look like especially if you're

339
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
um you know part of a business that has

340
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
a large supply chain in china

341
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
or if you're a crisis manager that

342
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
manages um

343
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,399
travelers that are going to china um

344
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,160
lots of good information here from

345
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,800
open source intel um on average we were

346
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,160
seeing that

347
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,800
emergent incidents uh were reported

348
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,279
almost

349
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,279
about five and a half hours faster with

350
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,959
intelligence alerts versus

351
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,599
breaking news

352
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,920
and then just one more slide on the

353
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,279
coronavirus topic

354
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
in four out of five instances as the

355
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,839
coronavirus was worsening

356
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,200
and in making major news updates

357
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
we did find out that four out of five

358
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,399
times

359
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,480
these major updates were reported first

360
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,600
by

361
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,800
open source intel feeds versus u.s news

362
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
all right so let's dive right into some

363
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,640
case studies with real-time crisis

364
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,839
management

365
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,920
so the idea here is to use real-time

366
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
ocean to enhance your situational

367
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,440
awareness about incidents as they're

368
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
occurring

369
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,160
so you can see some icons on the screen

370
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
i'm sure you maybe recognize a few of

371
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,399
them already maybe a few are new to you

372
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,320
so we'll go through all of these and

373
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
others to talk about how

374
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
you can use a mix of tools at the same

375
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
time simultaneously

376
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,160
in order to really gain an enhanced

377
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,079
context in situational awareness

378
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,680
about incidents as they're occurring on

379
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,079
the ground

380
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,000
all right so here's just a quick index

381
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
of some of the tools we're going to talk

382
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
about i'll give

383
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
everyone just a quick second to maybe

384
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,760
screenshot this live this one's a good

385
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,480
index and

386
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
a good item to keep in the back pocket

387
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,839
all right so with this first example i

388
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,639
really want to

389
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,880
talk about how we use osim to layer

390
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,399
information to gain that situation

391
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,519
awareness

392
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,240
so let's say for example um you

393
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
subscribe to the u.s geological survey

394
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,839
major earthquake alerts system so let's

395
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,040
say you want to hear about

396
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
any earthquake that's above a 7.1

397
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,279
magnitude pretty impactful

398
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
so you get this alert and you see all

399
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,480
right so a 7.1 magnitude earthquake

400
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,040
occurred

401
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
in pueblo mexico looks like on your map

402
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
it's a little bit south of mexico city

403
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,720
so you're wondering

404
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
all right does this earthquake impact

405
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,240
mexico city

406
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,720
um you don't really know how many miles

407
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
away it is at this point unless if you

408
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,399
do

409
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,560
a little bit more research but really

410
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
this is all the information on your

411
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
screen that you get

412
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
from a usgs early morning alert

413
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
so not a whole lot of information and i

414
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
still have a lot of questions

415
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,600
so it looks like this alert said the

416
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,839
earthquake epicenter was 48 kilometers

417
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,639
deep

418
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
i don't know what that means i'm not a

419
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,720
geologist i i don't study earthquakes on

420
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
a day-to-day basis so

421
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,959
does a 48 kilometer deep earthquake mean

422
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,240
that you don't really feel it on the

423
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
surface or does that mean

424
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,880
you feel it worse don't really know um

425
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,839
7.1

426
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,839
i think that sounds kind of bad but

427
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,000
maybe it's not as bad as i think it is

428
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,839
so we still have a lot of questions and

429
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,600
let's use some open source tools to

430
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,720
really define

431
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
um these questions that we have and find

432
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,360
some answers as well

433
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
so usgs also provides additional context

434
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,880
um through their seismic sensors and

435
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,760
projections

436
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,000
so you again you can go just to their

437
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,600
website and see this occur

438
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
um you can see kind of the orange in the

439
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,760
middle maybe that's pretty bad maybe the

440
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,560
yellow you feel a bit of trembling

441
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,079
maybe in the green and blue maybe you

442
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
don't feel much at all so

443
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,839
um that's just an assumption let's see

444
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,800
how we can actually

445
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,920
find out more so usgs

446
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
interestingly has a did you feel it kind

447
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,440
of crowdsourced

448
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
information where people on the ground

449
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,959
are able to report back and into this

450
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,440
aggregated system to say all right yes i

451
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,959
felt extreme

452
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,600
shaking there's a lot of damage or you

453
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
know it was a moderate earthquake

454
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,399
no real damage here in this location so

455
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,240
as people report this information back

456
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
you can see how this is more useful

457
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
and gives you more context and actually

458
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,199
gives you some

459
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,120
language that you can associate with

460
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,680
impact in certain areas

461
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,600
so you can obviously see where where the

462
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
earthquake probably um

463
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
hit the hardest and where was most

464
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
impactful

465
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,519
now going one step deeper what we can

466
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
then do is use social media

467
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
around each of these particular

468
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
locations you can zoom in find different

469
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
city names different town names

470
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,279
um search those keywords search those

471
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,079
locations

472
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,680
on social media websites we'll talk

473
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
about a few and you can see information

474
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,519
to add more context into what's

475
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,959
happening here so

476
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,160
um we've we've basically changed

477
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,279
you know a 7.1 48 kilometer deep

478
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,000
number which is it doesn't have any

479
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
context at all

480
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,199
and now we've added so much context uh

481
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,240
to this situation

482
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,839
here all right so this is another

483
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,279
example and i want to dive into more of

484
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,560
the the social media

485
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,920
aspect here as well so um

486
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
this is a case study based on the

487
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,279
barcelona spain uh vehicle ramming

488
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,680
attack that was back in 2017

489
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,839
um in the initial alert or first

490
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,440
indication of this incident occurred

491
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
from a tweet where someone said

492
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
uh there's a stampede right now at el

493
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,639
corte english and

494
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,000
plaza catalunya in barcelona so um based

495
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,759
on this little red icon on the map you

496
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,680
can kind of see where that is

497
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,199
and then if you know anything about

498
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,959
barcelona if you've ever traveled there

499
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
or just a quick google search you can

500
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,720
see that la rambla

501
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,839
is a pretty populated uh market area

502
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,880
with a lot of

503
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,759
um just pedestrian traffic on the street

504
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,880
there

505
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,360
so this first incident um you know kind

506
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
of indicates that it's

507
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,839
it's in one location it may be isolated

508
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,839
um but as we get more information and

509
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,199
more tweets start coming in

510
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,800
we start to really see the full picture

511
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
of what's happening so

512
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,880
pictures videos from social media on the

513
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
ground start to spread using the hashtag

514
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
barcelona and also using the

515
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
geocode for the location of barcelona as

516
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,600
well

517
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
so as this information starts coming in

518
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
using those hashtags you can start to

519
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
develop a better situational awareness

520
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,279
because you start to see different areas

521
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,639
that have been impacted

522
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
um you could look at different buildings

523
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,519
street names you can look at

524
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,440
business names on the side of businesses

525
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,039
and just google where they are

526
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,959
on the street to determine the full

527
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,480
length and the full impact of this

528
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,880
incident

529
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,359
and then we start to see um social media

530
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,000
coming in about where the van stopped

531
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and you can see that there's a really

532
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,359
distinct street art

533
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,520
um over which the van is stopped with

534
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,039
that um

535
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,919
uh interesting mural i guess on the

536
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,720
ground

537
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
in the tile so using this information

538
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,320
and the information you just basically

539
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,919
pulled from social media you can almost

540
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,559
map where this incident has occurred its

541
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,240
entire trajectory

542
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,720
um knowing the amount of foot traffic

543
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,039
that's probably in this area during

544
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,360
rush hour you can already start to make

545
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
judgments about the magnitude of

546
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
potential casualties

547
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
um in this case um there were a lot over

548
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,559
100 people

549
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,760
injured 14 fatalities um and that is

550
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
something that you could expect

551
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,440
um before news even started to report on

552
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,559
it so

553
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,000
using this situation awareness you can

554
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
already start to make judgments about

555
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,520
magnitude about proximity

556
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,120
um and yeah have

557
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,679
basically judgment over a a situation

558
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,160
before

559
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
really starts to hit the news

560
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,760
um entering another layer of context you

561
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,640
can also look at

562
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
3d maps so in this case google earth was

563
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,000
super helpful in this incident

564
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,039
so if i go ahead and search

565
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,840
la rambla

566
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,799
it should come up all right

567
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,679
so use tools at your disposal like

568
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,840
google earth this is a great 3d visual

569
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
representation

570
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
um that that you can use to make

571
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,120
judgments and actually interestingly

572
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,960
right here where this map brought us

573
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,360
this right here is placide catalunya

574
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,240
where the incident supposedly started

575
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
and then what you can do kind of as

576
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
those tweets start coming in

577
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
um and you start to see more context

578
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,960
about buildings and

579
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
different businesses that are impacted

580
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,080
you can pretty much

581
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
oh i might go in the wrong direction i

582
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,840
am going the wrong direction here

583
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,440
um it is

584
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,880
this way so yeah a little bit of trial

585
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
and error maybe the first time but as

586
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
you get those feeds and more incidents

587
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
happening you can almost follow it um in

588
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,760
real time

589
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
or near real time and ultimately

590
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,280
where the van stopped oh

591
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,120
let's see yep you can follow it all the

592
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,840
way down and

593
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
estimate basically the the entire

594
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
duration the entire trajectory of that

595
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,559
attack

596
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,679
um estimating out the mileage the

597
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,160
how far it occurred and potentially the

598
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,039
number of casualties there as well

599
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,559
so i also want to bring up tweetdeck

600
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,080
because i mentioned tweets a lot in that

601
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,880
example

602
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
and treetech is great um basically it

603
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
creates a number of feeds for you

604
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,559
um you can use different search terms

605
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,840
so in one of these feeds i would

606
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
probably just put hashtag barcelona if

607
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,120
that incident was occurring

608
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
and get real-time tweets using that

609
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,720
hashtag i would also probably put

610
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,919
another alert in

611
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,280
for um the geocode location of barcelona

612
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,600
so

613
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,039
even if someone doesn't use hashtag

614
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,200
barcelona if they're still tweeting with

615
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,679
that

616
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
geolocation on on their phone it'll

617
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,840
still pop up as being in that same area

618
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,159
all right so here's another example

619
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
um that's way for all the videos to come

620
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,240
up great so this is back in 2019 when um

621
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
mumbai india was having some really

622
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
severe monsoon flooding

623
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
um so we had some travelers who were in

624
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
india at the time

625
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,159
and we were trying to figure out the

626
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,240
best way for them to get back home from

627
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,520
the office

628
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,159
um it was really difficult they ended up

629
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,360
calling us because they

630
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
they felt at the office they didn't know

631
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,520
which way to go there was a lot of news

632
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,400
about

633
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,720
streets flooded things like that so we

634
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,919
were asked to advise them

635
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,360
basically on the neighborhoods that are

636
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,320
at least impacted by this monsoon

637
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,240
so that's really difficult because news

638
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,000
articles aren't really updating in real

639
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
time like that so we we went to social

640
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,559
media

641
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,280
and we found a lot of live videos um

642
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
some near real time videos so like

643
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,080
facebook live is

644
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
our live videos uh snapchat maps are

645
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
near real time

646
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
um snapchat doesn't typically post um in

647
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,679
exactly real time but you can find

648
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,240
videos

649
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,360
from say 10 minutes ago 20 minutes ago

650
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
to assess the situation in a certain

651
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,480
area

652
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,000
and then earthkam is another example

653
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
i'll show a few examples of basically

654
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
city cams that are around the world

655
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,159
um so snapchat map i think most people

656
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,320
probably are familiar with this one so

657
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,679
um let's see snapchat map shows you the

658
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,120
activity that's occurring in a certain

659
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,559
area so

660
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,799
let me just scroll into paris here

661
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,919
and it looks like let's see let's click

662
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,120
on what's what's happening in this

663
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,559
neighborhood of paris all right it looks

664
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,159
like someone's enjoying a

665
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
some steak and fries um all right it

666
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,559
looks like

667
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,000
things are normal in this area

668
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
looks like a lot of people at this train

669
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
station so let's say for example

670
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,039
if there was an incident happening in

671
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,400
this train station you would be able to

672
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,720
just

673
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,360
scroll exactly into that area see if

674
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,039
there are any recent tweets there

675
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,559
um and actually it's funny because i

676
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,240
recognize that train station name as

677
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,919
they went over to it um as a station

678
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,679
that gets evacuated like almost every

679
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,400
weekend

680
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
uh due to suspicious packages being left

681
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,440
around

682
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,360
so um let's say if you're responsible

683
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
for any travelers going through the

684
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,360
garden or

685
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
gerda nord station in paris um and

686
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
you're getting tweets about that station

687
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,080
being evacuated

688
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,240
um you could inform your travelers in

689
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,799
real time

690
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,919
all right so snapchat map um covering

691
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
earth cam really quick so

692
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,720
um earth cam is a great example of just

693
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,000
one of those city cams

694
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
um you guys maybe remember these sites

695
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
from like 10 years ago

696
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,120
where people just post like uh live

697
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
video feeds from different cities around

698
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,320
the world

699
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,919
so let's click on a popular one here

700
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,679
here's a good map

701
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,440
uh you can search for any particular

702
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
cities like if you hear about something

703
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,080
major happening in chicago um

704
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,679
particularly at a major tourist

705
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,200
destination you could go ahead and click

706
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,159
on chicago and

707
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
a lot of those destinations just have a

708
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,000
webcam that runs 24 7 over that area

709
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
and then similarly to earth cam there's

710
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
also worldcams.tv

711
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,559
um same idea same concept um

712
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,640
so if i want to click over to i wonder

713
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,960
let's see what uh shibuya station looks

714
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
like in tokyo at the moment

715
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,400
i wonder if it's too dark there right

716
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,640
now

717
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
yeah it looks like no one's really on

718
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
the street it's probably super early in

719
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,039
japan at the moment

720
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
um but let's click on maybe something

721
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,480
with more activity maybe something like

722
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,520
damn square in amsterdam so if you've

723
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,200
got an alert about some incident

724
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
happening in amsterdam maybe a major

725
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
protest maybe there was unfortunately

726
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,159
an attack um you can zoom in

727
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,840
kind of judge what's happening in the

728
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
location are there a lot of people

729
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
congregating here

730
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,919
are people running around the city like

731
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,480
crazy do we see a lot of police officers

732
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,919
um things like that um all right so this

733
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,679
is another good example both of these

734
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,159
kind of

735
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,200
live webcam sites um

736
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
interestingly i i did want to show this

737
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,279
one um just as an example so this is a

738
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,120
camera at zurich airport again just on

739
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
worldcamps.tv

740
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,520
um interestingly some of these cameras

741
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,960
that are connected to the internet you

742
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,320
can actually control

743
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
which you would never think that someone

744
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,679
online could control a camera at the

745
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,880
airport

746
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
so if i wanted to just for example go

747
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
over to this location

748
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
it'll pan you right to that location

749
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,000
if you want to go to the tower oh

750
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,240
is it going to bring me there maybe the

751
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,159
tower's offline

752
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,200
but um

753
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
yeah basically it's funny that you can

754
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
control some of these cameras to

755
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,320
to get a better situation awareness

756
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,520
about what's going on on the ground

757
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,200
there

758
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,679
all right

759
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
so this is another example about um a

760
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,120
potentially an incident that was

761
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
occurring at los angeles international

762
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,919
airport

763
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,760
for any travelers that were there in

764
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
2016 you might remember there was the

765
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,200
active shooter scare

766
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,279
um basically nobody really knows how

767
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,320
this started um

768
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,640
it was just a loud sound and people

769
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
started running thinking that it was a

770
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,279
shooter

771
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,960
it could have very well just been

772
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
something someone accidentally dropping

773
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,400
their luggage on the ground creating a

774
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
large noise and people just started to

775
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,279
disperse

776
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,440
but with that initial information there

777
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,799
were people running out of the airport

778
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,960
evacuating onto the tarmac

779
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,480
you're seeing a lot of tweets social

780
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
media that's just the trend nowadays

781
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,520
where uh

782
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,840
as you're in an emergency situation you

783
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
know first instinct

784
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
maybe you still get out of there and

785
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,960
then second instinct is

786
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
share on social media although i think

787
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
some people have that reversed where

788
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
you're gonna start sharing on social

789
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,159
media before you start to evacuate

790
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,200
um but anyway so um

791
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
the icon down on the bottom right is one

792
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
that we haven't talked about

793
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,919
and that is the icon for broadcastify

794
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,120
and if you're not familiar with

795
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
broadcastify that is

796
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,400
a basically an aggregated online source

797
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,279
of police

798
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,559
radio chat or communications they have

799
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,720
feeds from basically every major police

800
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,000
department around the us

801
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,120
and i think they do have some

802
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,279
international as well so

803
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,880
if you've got you have a domestic

804
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
incident in a major city or even a

805
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,600
non-major city

806
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,440
um chances are that there's probably

807
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,039
some police chatter

808
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,120
and some radio that you can tap into

809
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
online through broadcastify

810
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
you no longer have to be within radio

811
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
proximity in order to

812
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,799
collect that information so in this

813
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,240
incident we've received we were

814
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,080
basically hearing that all officers

815
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,200
respond to shooting in progress at lax

816
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,320
that sounds really bad um you know

817
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,360
active shooter

818
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,000
populated area um all officers

819
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
responding

820
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
um but then as we kind of wait and see

821
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
more information we kind of well we've

822
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,880
kind of get the idea that all right the

823
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,320
possible danger

824
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,960
um is maybe in terminal seven six or

825
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,520
five

826
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,279
that's where we see a lot of the running

827
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,640
a lot of the evacuating out to the

828
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,679
tarmac

829
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,799
um a lot of chaos

830
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
but then what we see kind of in the

831
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,399
other terminals terminal one terminal

832
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:22,799
two

833
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,279
terminal three and four um it's a little

834
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,320
bit more calm

835
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,919
people are still evacuating just because

836
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,640
it was a full airport wide evacuation

837
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,399
but nobody is really running all over

838
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,240
the place it seems calm

839
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
the nice woman on the bottom left is

840
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
calmly directing people

841
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,720
um and then also on broadcastify we hear

842
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,600
uh the phrase

843
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,000
all clear in terminal four so we

844
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,520
basically already know right terminal

845
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,640
four is all clear

846
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,799
no issue there terminal 1 looks like

847
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,480
it's okay terminal 2 looks like it's

848
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,200
okay

849
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,600
so if you're a traveler or if you're

850
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
responsible for any travelers who are

851
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,679
scheduled to depart out of lax today

852
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,080
um you already know where the safest

853
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
area probably is in the airport so it's

854
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
probably not near

855
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,080
terminals five six and seven um but it's

856
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,840
probably closer to one two and three

857
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
and if you're evacuating if there's a

858
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,559
lot of chaos people are probably going

859
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,080
in all different directions

860
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
um so just to know where there's

861
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,520
potential safety versus a potential

862
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,559
hazard

863
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,080
great information to have when minutes

864
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
matter

865
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,320
all right so this is an example of

866
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,919
when i was working again as a security

867
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,399
analyst a lot of our travelers

868
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,320
had an app on their phone where they

869
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,919
could alert us if a security incident

870
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,960
was happening around them

871
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
and we would automatically be alerted

872
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,159
start to respond

873
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,159
um and help them out of whatever crisis

874
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,240
they're in so this wasn't the exact

875
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
video that was occurring but it's a good

876
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,720
good representation of what we saw um on

877
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,760
their

878
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,399
app when they alerted us what's really

879
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,840
cool with a lot of the apps nowadays

880
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,159
especially the traveler safety apps is

881
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,559
once you hit that sos button it can

882
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,760
record

883
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,039
what's happening kind of on the other

884
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,799
side of your camera for a quick 30

885
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,679
second interval

886
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,960
and also stream that to whoever is um

887
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,600
receiving your sos alert so in this

888
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,640
instance

889
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
we get the video and we get the

890
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,799
coordinates of where it's happening

891
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,799
so already very easy plot those

892
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
coordinates on a map

893
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,440
all right so i see some difficulty with

894
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,200
this map right here first of all

895
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,240
um my korean is not that great so

896
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,720
i probably wouldn't be able to guide

897
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,240
travelers on where to go in this

898
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,279
incident

899
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,360
so let's think of some other things that

900
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,679
we can do

901
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
oh where did that slide go

902
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,080
oh no we're missing a slide here okay so

903
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
basically what we did here

904
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,399
is uh we used google street view

905
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,799
and we used bing street view and i think

906
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,440
yandex also has a good street view

907
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,760
another good one is open earth cam and

908
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,440
what we did is we took a street view of

909
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,799
that exact location

910
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,399
and we kind of panned around we got a

911
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,720
360 view of what was happening on that

912
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,200
ground

913
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,960
on the ground there um we can see that

914
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,640
all right over on one side there's a

915
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
there's kind of like a market that's

916
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,240
it's only one story the buildings don't

917
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
look super secure

918
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,159
um on the other side it's just a field

919
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:14,880
um

920
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
no real cover no real protection no real

921
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,360
shelter and then if you turn again

922
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
on the other corner there's a large

923
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,799
building um

924
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,039
which happens to also be uh have an

925
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,360
american flag that you can see outside

926
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,039
and as you zoom in to look at what that

927
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,200
building actually is it's a jw marriott

928
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,240
hotel

929
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
it's like a five-star hotel that just

930
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,799
happens to be at this corner here

931
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,960
um so if your job is to advise a

932
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
traveler or

933
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,559
anyone what to do in this situation if

934
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,600
they're caught in the middle of a

935
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,799
protest

936
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,880
if the options are a field with no

937
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
protection

938
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,159
or a small one-story market with kind of

939
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,360
rickety buildings

940
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,200
or on the other hand you've got the

941
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,440
five-star jw marriott right there

942
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,039
um pretty good idea to have your

943
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,880
traveler just hold out

944
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,960
for a few minutes in the lobby of the

945
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,720
marriott

946
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,399
a lot of the american branded hotels

947
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
european branded hotels abroad are very

948
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,840
safe very secure

949
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,519
um they're up to american code and

950
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,039
safety standards

951
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,640
um and especially if you're a traveler

952
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,000
in distress they're gonna try to help

953
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,440
you out even if you aren't staying at

954
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,840
that hotel

955
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,120
so here's another example um back from

956
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,799
istanbul turkey and i'm sure everyone

957
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,840
here remembers the

958
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,600
coup attempt um so

959
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,279
we were first alerted to this incident

960
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,640
and kind of three things were happening

961
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,279
all at once it was a lot of chaos

962
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,519
um so first thing we were hearing about

963
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,440
were jets were bombarding around the

964
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,880
presidential palace in

965
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,519
ankara which all right that's pretty bad

966
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,080
um

967
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,120
even just by itself um

968
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,559
our company at the time we didn't have

969
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,480
any offices we didn't have any travelers

970
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,519
in acura so

971
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,080
we were just monitoring the situation um

972
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,519
but then we started to see a lot of

973
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,200
activity happening in istanbul

974
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,720
where we have a huge office we have a

975
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,480
big supply chain distribution we have a

976
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,559
lot of travelers and employees there

977
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,080
so we just wanted to make sure that all

978
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,600
right is this going to impact our

979
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,080
our staff and our sites there and

980
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,720
ultimately

981
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,720
it did um so in istanbul

982
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,519
versus ankara what we're seeing is a lot

983
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,120
of the police arresting

984
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,039
military military arresting the police

985
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,320
vice versa

986
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,760
um basically martial law to some chaotic

987
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,440
degree

988
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,320
we were also seeing tanks basically

989
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,960
blocking

990
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
all of the bridges from the european to

991
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,720
the asian side of istanbul back and

992
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
forth

993
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,679
soldiers were blocking a lot of the

994
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,000
major roadways and it turned out to be

995
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
a huge incident obviously a coup is not

996
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
something that occurs on an everyday

997
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,919
basis

998
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,600
so um kind of interesting story

999
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,919
about one of our travelers um if you

1000
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,279
guys recognize this date

1001
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,960
that's um 7 15 in istanbul um

1002
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,440
if you remember the day before was

1003
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,000
actually

1004
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,279
the day of the um nice uh terrorist

1005
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,039
attacks over in france where the

1006
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,240
that um lori or the the truck

1007
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,159
rammed through again another large crowd

1008
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,519
in nice

1009
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,440
we actually had a traveler on this day

1010
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,760
the day after he was in nice

1011
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,519
during the attack he was coming back to

1012
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,360
istanbul through istanbul at a turk

1013
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,880
airport today

1014
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
so he just leaves the scene of one

1015
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,640
terrorist attack is flying now

1016
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,080
into a coup attempt where the airport

1017
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,399
for for a time gets even controlled by

1018
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,840
by military

1019
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,799
um so he just has the worst luck of any

1020
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,240
traveler in the world

1021
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,080
but anyway we have to be prepared for

1022
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,360
when he finally lands

1023
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,240
and um tries to try to find shelter for

1024
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,760
him because it's just madness

1025
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,880
lots happening on the streets here so he

1026
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,360
ended up

1027
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
getting in a car trying to find some way

1028
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,399
to evacuate some

1029
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,519
some safe um some safe haven

1030
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,679
um he ended up getting caught in some

1031
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,679
traffic and there was another blockade

1032
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,440
on that road so he really had nowhere to

1033
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,039
go at that point

1034
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,960
um and the difficulty again we had with

1035
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
this situation was a little bit of a

1036
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,600
language barrier

1037
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,560
um some difficulty with street names uh

1038
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,079
he was giving us street names

1039
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,639
cross sections that that we just could

1040
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,359
not tell

1041
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,719
in the turkish language like how to

1042
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,719
spell that how to find it on the maps

1043
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,440
so there's this really interesting kind

1044
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,119
of newer company out there

1045
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,280
um that provides a free service called

1046
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,320
what three words

1047
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,679
um what three words.com and

1048
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,280
let's say for example i'm already zoomed

1049
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,760
into this street um in istanbul

1050
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,760
and it's like akikiya

1051
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,119
sk i'm sorry i'm pronouncing that

1052
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,399
terribly wrong

1053
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,960
um i already know it and just imagine if

1054
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
you're a traveler on an international

1055
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
phone line and there's a lot of static a

1056
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,599
lot of delay

1057
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,119
we're not going to be able to understand

1058
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,560
each other especially if all the street

1059
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,079
names are like this

1060
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,399
so about what three words does it's

1061
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,079
really cool um what it essentially has

1062
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,280
done is it has mapped

1063
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,079
every three by three foot square across

1064
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:00,720
the entire

1065
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,119
face of the earth so you can click on

1066
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,640
any of these cells

1067
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,000
um and it gives you a unique three words

1068
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,920
um that you can use to communicate and

1069
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
someone on the other end of the line

1070
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,480
can kind of reverse engineer so pocket

1071
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,200
stumpy

1072
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,079
spines that's a little bit easier to say

1073
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,920
than octa cured

1074
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
moreni um so um

1075
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,480
you know there are of course easier

1076
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,920
words to say than others and you can

1077
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
just click around until you find a good

1078
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,079
one

1079
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,320
so we just have the traveler basically

1080
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,680
translate all right

1081
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,320
what's in in plain english now what's

1082
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,800
the

1083
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,839
the location of where you're at so um

1084
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,680
it kind of works both ways too you can

1085
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,880
you can click on different

1086
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
locations here and you can use these

1087
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
locations for travelers and then they

1088
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:44,960
can

1089
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,720
translate it back to location on their

1090
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,079
end um

1091
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,920
or if you have the app on your phone you

1092
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,119
can just go to the app

1093
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,119
um click the button say where am i and

1094
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,560
boom you have the three words right

1095
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,200
there

1096
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
so you can just tell those three words

1097
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,119
to anyone on the other end of the line

1098
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,720
and they know the exact pretty much

1099
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,040
three by three foot square that you're

1100
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,000
in at the present time

1101
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,680
all right so i do want to quickly spend

1102
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,200
the last couple minutes just on vetting

1103
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,040
and verifying information because as you

1104
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
all know open source and social

1105
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,040
social media information can be and is

1106
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,160
manipulated

1107
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,880
all the time so this is one example not

1108
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,720
exactly social media that kind of is

1109
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,960
kind of our social signals in a way so

1110
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,880
obviously google maps crowd sources

1111
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,960
their their traffic information

1112
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,760
um when when everyone who has the map on

1113
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,960
in that location

1114
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,040
is stuck in traffic google knows and

1115
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,440
updates that traffic for everyone else

1116
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,760
so just a funny example here here was

1117
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,440
this guy who pulled those 99

1118
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,400
iphones around in a trolley um outside

1119
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,520
the google berlin

1120
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,160
office to try to make it show that there

1121
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,520
was a lot of traffic on the street at

1122
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,320
the time

1123
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,839
as you can see in the pictures there is

1124
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,240
nobody on the street

1125
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,400
so here's a more serious example of a

1126
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
major crisis that was occurring

1127
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,560
back in 2014 um at the colombian

1128
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,920
chemicals plant

1129
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
and i think it's st mary's parish in

1130
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,079
louisiana super small town um

1131
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,320
nothing super notable about it sorry if

1132
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,599
you're from there

1133
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,240
but no real reason why it would be the

1134
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
epicenter of a major disinformation

1135
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,200
campaign

1136
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,079
which it was in this incident so all of

1137
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,359
a sudden

1138
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,560
back in 2014 uh the russian internet

1139
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,760
research agency

1140
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,320
decided it wanted to either troll or

1141
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,839
provide some

1142
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,880
um i guess chaos

1143
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,320
in the united states maybe they were

1144
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
testing out some of their social media

1145
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,079
disinformation campaigns at the time

1146
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,040
but fake cnn websites fake no local news

1147
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,760
websites

1148
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,800
tweets um even a terrorist video went up

1149
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,160
claiming responsibility for this

1150
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,839
explosion that happened at columbian

1151
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,280
chemicals plant

1152
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,960
except what happened what happened was

1153
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,400
there was no explosion

1154
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,079
everyone in this town was freaking out

1155
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,359
because they felt like the major

1156
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,119
employer in the town has just exploded

1157
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,720
plenty of casualties

1158
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,359
um when in fact there was no truth

1159
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,800
behind this incident at all there was

1160
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,560
just a coordinated misinformed

1161
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,760
information and disinformation campaign

1162
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,800
uh again perpetrated by this building in

1163
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,040
st

1164
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,880
petersburg russia that we know now is

1165
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
the internet research agency

1166
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,839
so while i was studying them back in

1167
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,079
2014

1168
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,680
we can kind of see the impact that they

1169
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,599
had now in 2016

1170
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,480
and can still continues to go through

1171
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
this day

1172
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,160
so i like to think that was probably

1173
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,839
just their first test of a major

1174
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,520
coordinated

1175
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,560
information attack in the u.s so here

1176
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,280
are some

1177
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,920
verification techniques um use lots of

1178
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,720
sources

1179
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,400
look at the right reliability of those

1180
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
sources

1181
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
live video is a good indicator but can

1182
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,359
still be manipulated

1183
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,400
um use reverse image searches a lot of

1184
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,599
crisis imagery is recycled from past

1185
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,320
incidents

1186
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
so if you see a tweet that maybe sounds

1187
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,520
a little bit far-fetched

1188
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,280
reverse image search that see if that

1189
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,359
photo was actually used from

1190
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,280
an incident that occurred years ago um

1191
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,200
so again just quick instructions on how

1192
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,720
to do that in chrome you can just right

1193
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,960
click the image reverse image search it

1194
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,480
so you can see this protest that was

1195
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
supposedly happening two days ago

1196
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,079
um was actually from a photo four years

1197
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,760
ago

1198
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,040
um i know we're in the last couple

1199
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
minutes here so just a few more examples

1200
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
about you know fake news articles how to

1201
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,640
spot them um basically all these

1202
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,480
examples are fake so in the first

1203
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,119
example

1204
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,440
uh supposedly headline was italy cracks

1205
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,880
down on protests

1206
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,640
you can see there are chinese characters

1207
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
on the street side of the image

1208
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,079
and you can also see that twitter handle

1209
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,680
is an impersonator account it's

1210
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,160
supposedly looking like new york times

1211
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,079
it's a c instead of an e so always take

1212
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,359
a look uh one more time with those

1213
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,040
usernames

1214
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,280
uh similarly you know we're looking at

1215
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,880
um extremism

1216
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,520
lots of uh you know false information

1217
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,359
with a fake british

1218
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,560
website that image of the cop car has a

1219
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,320
france flag on it

1220
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
and then in the third example this was a

1221
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,680
widely spread image after

1222
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,079
a an earthquake in taiwan this breaking

1223
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,680
news article came out with it saying the

1224
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,359
philippines president was killed in a

1225
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,880
manila earthquake

1226
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,040
um philippines again was felt wrong in

1227
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,480
the title so

1228
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,000
just some things to look into there um

1229
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,079
quick screenshot over on these risk

1230
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,680
keywords if you're on monitor on your

1231
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,599
own i know we've got just a few seconds

1232
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,640
left

1233
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,160
based on our analysis most global

1234
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,839
security and travel risks occur between

1235
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,920
7 am and 10 am eastern time this makes

1236
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,680
sense because the us is waking up

1237
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,599
europe is already awake and asia is

1238
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,200
still up about to go to bed soon

1239
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,680
during any other time um on this range

1240
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,599
you lose one of the continents because

1241
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,800
they're all sleeping all right

1242
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,160
and i think we can bring this right

1243
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,599
towards the end

1244
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,319
um sharpen those skills formalize an

1245
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,839
internal training program if you use

1246
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,720
these skills for

1247
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,440
corporate uh exercise your skills with

1248
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,920
simulations and tabletop exercises

1249
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,599
there are some great geolocation and

1250
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,280
chronolocation games

1251
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,200
uh geoguesser is a great one just google

1252
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,359
that same with quiz time over on twitter

1253
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,720
and also consider some professional

1254
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
analytical training techniques

1255
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
um so conferences trainings just like

1256
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
this one um and

1257
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,520
incorporate those structured analytic

1258
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,920
methodologies so i'll go ahead and end

1259
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,079
it at this point so crisis management

1260
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,160
programs whether you know you're an

1261
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
actual crisis manager

1262
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,839
or just a curious mind or a journalist

1263
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,040
or a security analyst

1264
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,359
you can all use this information to go

1265
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,200
from reactive to proactive

1266
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,920
qualitative to quantitative and ad hoc

1267
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,520
to risk focused

1268
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,040
so i'll go ahead and end it at this

1269
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,560
point

1270
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,800
