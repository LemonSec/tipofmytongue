1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,279
um so yeah mg will be on here he is

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,010
going to be talking about rapid

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,240
prototyping chaos so for those of you

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,030
who have followed mg at his his work he

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,500
has done a significant amount of really

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,380
really interesting projects with

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,198
hardware including backdooring

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,140
everything from charging cables to power

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,220
bricks to you name it he's probably back

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,720
door in it and so he has a few projects

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,960
that are out there that you can purchase

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,579
the OMG cable and even Steve you may

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,850
have seen some of his POC videos I heard

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,649
him on our podcast in years past but he

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,300
is here to talk to us about rapid

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:49,289
prototyping hardware so yeah it's almost

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:55,199
guess the minute everybody tweet out

18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:01:03,239
about this if you want to and initial

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:07,229
folks from the foot crab alright you

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,259
hear me yes we all right we are good to

21
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:18,720
go um I switch over to my desktop real

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:21,979
quick and share that doesn't my about me

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,979
slide it's really all I got

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,579
I'm going to talk about the last I don't

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,329
know about your worth of the rapid

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,579
prototype you know done because it kind

27
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,189
of changes the way you think and here's

28
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,929
a just a stack actually about six months

29
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,679
old now stack of all my failures like

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:48,840
all the PCBs I've made that just didn't

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,869
work but before we get in there and go

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,110
back to 2017 before I knew how to do any

33
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,460
of this I decided I wanted to make an

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,159
exploding USB Drive

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,929
I just cool idea right but let's cross

36
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,439
it with the USB rubber ducky cuz you

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,210
know naturally had no idea how to do any

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,788
of that so I sketched it the basic

39
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,879
schematic out on paper that's literally

40
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,859
what you see here and this is the

41
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,670
physical layout

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,230
the board it's uh it worked right like

43
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,649
there were a lot of software packages

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,130
out there for designing things that it

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,860
was just too complex it was just more

46
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,160
hurdle than I wanted so I was gonna use

47
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,070
some some paper right and didn't know

48
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,500
how to make PCBs but I found these cool

49
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:40,290
grids of copper squares called SMT pads

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,820
and what I was using to kind of

51
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,780
construct this very first prototype

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,209
using copper tape and stuff it works

53
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,880
kind of you know assembled it and that

54
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,860
was the first prototype here I call this

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,130
mr. your self-destruct all right and

56
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,780
here it is you know chopped off a USB

57
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,850
connector from an existing flash drive

58
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,630
because you know where do I get USB

59
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,280
connectors right

60
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:08,640
um this had the little bonus if we go

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,050
back up in to this schematic over on the

62
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:17,579
right is basically a kind of like a

63
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:22,260
relay that would allow an additional pin

64
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:25,350
to I want to be careful here but

65
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,840
basically that allow the the fun

66
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,430
activities to happen later on that was

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,110
really the only addition the rest of the

68
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,140
circuit was basically just an eighty

69
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,290
tiny that would Bank bit banging is

70
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,899
where you may not have inside the

71
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,429
silicon of the chip the ability to do a

72
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,070
certain thing in this case this chip

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,290
didn't have USB but we can turn on and

74
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,140
off the pins really fast and emulate

75
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,060
what USB is expecting on those lines

76
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,130
rest that circuits already you know

77
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,830
well-established so I just took that and

78
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:00,470
added a little high power relay to it

79
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:03,450
and ultimately what we got was this

80
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:08,310
plenty of room inside here for all the

81
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,780
activities and I don't have sound shared

82
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,860
here let me see if I can do that real

83
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,299
quick that's crew whatever we're good

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,250
anyway

85
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:24,720
this was the first mr. Sol District

86
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,820
right so you plug it in and ducky pelo

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,240
come out and once on the screen opens

88
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,240
your browser

89
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:37,890
and opens the video and you see little

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,450
Jack in the Box here you hear the

91
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,880
jack-in-the-box sound is what you would

92
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,320
hear if I had sound sure but I don't and

93
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,730
it goes for a little bit longer than

94
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:52,730
you'd expect because you we got to build

95
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:57,410
tension right and then eventually pop

96
00:04:52,730 --> 00:05:00,030
bunch of confetti flies out that's cool

97
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:05,520
put other things in there like smoke

98
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,169
bombs right looks pretty cool ultimately

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,940
you know that that was pretty cool uh

100
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,770
what else could I do with it and I

101
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,750
started playing around with this

102
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,849
basically really tiny duckie which you

103
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,300
know the actual USB rubber ducky has way

104
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,370
more spacefill and it's a lot faster but

105
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,400
everybody knows what a ducky is so just

106
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:31,710
using that as a general term here this

107
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:34,729
started shove the demon seed inside of a

108
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,109
cable and that's where we got this right

109
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,520
my cable didn't actually work as a cable

110
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,740
it just look like a cables it's not

111
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,310
really a cable but you know there's

112
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,920
always room for improvement there basic

113
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,380
idea there right

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,800
it was chunky eaves big is you know very

115
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:57,900
the very first one right and might as

116
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,670
well shove that into a USB condom at the

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,560
same time right why not

118
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,630
that makes sense it really every looks

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,820
at Oh cable is why we need condoms I'm

120
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:18,870
like cool you need condoms let's up

121
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:20,969
your condoms same concept right polish

122
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:26,970
this up a little bit more and suddenly

123
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:29,370
we've got a little bit same concept but

124
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,980
now it charges we're not getting data

125
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,840
sync yet but it charges right which is

126
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,200
an improvement and visually looks a lot

127
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,299
better it's not exactly a match to a an

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,800
apple cable but it's close from a

129
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,090
distance but

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,849
you know if we will want to use this for

131
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,530
actual offensive to lean it's probably

132
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,280
not gonna pass when it's in the hands of

133
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,469
a target

134
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:56,969
it looks cool on stage that's about it

135
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:59,639
so but a year later so that was all 2017

136
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,759
very early 2018 but a year later I

137
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,349
decided I wanted to kind of ramp it up

138
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,360
actually here's a there's a good

139
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:10,229
comparison it's a close match but you

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,970
can see this this physical the large

141
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,880
connector here on the right and the top

142
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,039
is it's a bit chunkier it's longer it's

143
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,349
a close match but it's not perfect

144
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,870
anyway year later I decided I wanted to

145
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,940
chase that further let's let's get data

146
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,360
passing through so it's a real cable

147
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,210
right he works like a real cable data

148
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,120
passes charges but also you know let's

149
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,210
let's update these payloads remotely

150
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:41,130
because that's kind of what I would want

151
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,900
to do as an attacker and are you wanting

152
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,039
to what you just saw every time you want

153
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,729
to update a payload there you have to

154
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:50,159
plug the thing in update it you know

155
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,719
cool and it will just play under your

156
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,520
computer as you plug it in you can put a

157
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,020
delay but it's much like a rubber ducky

158
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,659
in that sense plug it in and then it

159
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,219
starts but in addition to updating them

160
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:01,949
remotely it would be cool to have a

161
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,250
trigger that's remote you know how do I

162
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,669
do that

163
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,060
I have no idea it's just I want to

164
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,068
accomplish this how do I design that and

165
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:15,360
about a year ago year and a half now

166
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:17,219
decided okay um software when you

167
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
approach it at least the way I approach

168
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:22,380
it it's it's really quick to just change

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,030
something compile see what breaks see

170
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,560
what changes just keep doing it over and

171
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,340
over and over that's you know a matter

172
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:34,039
of seconds per per cycle or spin with

173
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:37,828
hardware you know creating a PCB weeks

174
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,140
roughly per spin you design it and you

175
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:43,039
send it off to some manufacturer now

176
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,990
there are in-home methods for doing this

177
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,990
and that's what I kind of started

178
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:54,740
exploring there the older one is using

179
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,740
acid to etch copper off of a board so

180
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,230
fr4 or there's multiple types here but

181
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,750
I'm using fr for basic concept here is

182
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,570
you've got copper at least on the top

183
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,280
layer sometimes also the bottom layer

184
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,500
this is the number of layers your PCB is

185
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,839
so this is a two layer in between you've

186
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,790
got some fiberglass and epoxy mixture

187
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,480
that's just non conductive that's the

188
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:22,410
basic of what a PCB is and ultimately

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:27,960
those get turned it into PCBs right and

190
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:30,719
here's a raw fr4 panel right it's it's

191
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,180
just all copper sheet on at least one

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,930
side and then that yellow you see is the

193
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:43,380
fiberglass protector so here's a mil

194
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:47,069
cutting out traces instead of using acid

195
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,189
to remove portions of the board we're

196
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:54,210
just using a mill and this is quick it's

197
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,400
a lot more accurate more repeatable in

198
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,290
my opinion anyway and that's what I

199
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,290
decided I wanted to start chasing you

200
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,030
can see the process here millet solder

201
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,349
starter things up and boom you get a

202
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,980
circuit and it's it's pretty fast

203
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,900
process you know maybe an hour roughly

204
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,390
per spin depends on what you're making

205
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,790
how big the before it is complexity but

206
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,699
that's just what I wanted to chase like

207
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:22,160
cool I can now take my approach of rapid

208
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:26,130
failure to learn how to make these so I

209
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,800
decided to get one of these Bantam Mills

210
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,570
they're like 2,400 bucks now there are

211
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,640
other Mills out there they're much

212
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,340
cheaper I specifically went for the

213
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,490
Bantam because the software flow is

214
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:41,760
really easy just dump the file out out

215
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,590
of your design software Linda the the

216
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,330
Bantam and it abstracts a whole bunch of

217
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:49,470
things that are kind of connected to do

218
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:51,450
a C&C traces and Rob was called speeds

219
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,430
and feeds you know the mechanics the

220
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,230
physical nature of your tool movie and a

221
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,000
lot of that is abstracted into pre-made

222
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,100
libraries for you so it's like quick and

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,050
easy and you know I can save a revision

224
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,970
to my PCB and pull it into the bantam

225
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,899
software you know in seconds you hit go

226
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,600
and

227
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:13,709
new PCBs ready to go so on the Left I've

228
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,860
got kicad this is just PCB design

229
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,899
software this is the mr. self-destruct

230
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,879
at the time I pulled this in I'm like eh

231
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,149
that's gonna be like my hello world for

232
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,279
the Bantam mill I just got and the red

233
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:32,189
layer is the top layer the green is the

234
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:35,699
bottom and put let into the the bantam

235
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:37,529
softer right and probably took an hour

236
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,359
or two of back and forth and eventually

237
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:45,029
you know this pops out it's like cool

238
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:50,790
this this actually worked um would

239
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:52,829
fitted a cable pretty nicely so great um

240
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:58,349
hello world let's let's chase this

241
00:11:52,829 --> 00:12:00,479
deeper like let's get a finer traces the

242
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,579
the mils advertises not being able to do

243
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,110
these smaller footprints but we could

244
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,449
definitely ain't chase it so lots of

245
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,540
testing here different depths just

246
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:11,339
really repetitive iterations just to see

247
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,290
where the boundaries on on this mill are

248
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,610
this board looks wet because I've got it

249
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,259
covered in oil fr4 it's fiberglass and

250
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,759
when you mill it it's glass and dust up

251
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,189
in the air so you got to have some way

252
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,519
of either rapidly vacuuming that out

253
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:29,459
which I would later upgrade to but oil

254
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,189
really really heavy oil kind of paint it

255
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:37,498
on would do a good job of trapping

256
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:38,550
everything so more more testing right

257
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:41,370
test test test

258
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,889
and here's some microscope shots on the

259
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,749
top this is just a minor difference here

260
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,339
but you can see the traces nice and

261
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:50,699
clean on the bottom really rough on the

262
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:53,699
top and the difference between those two

263
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:55,620
is just the tips of these bits right

264
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:57,329
here the one on the left with a little

265
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,670
sharper tip was making these nice clean

266
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,378
cuts and the slightly rounded one would

267
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,878
make these rough cuts and you know you

268
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,889
don't you don't really know and I I

269
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,230
would always buy the cheapest tips

270
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,899
because they're called and mills rather

271
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,360
I was breaking these a lot and you know

272
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,389
I can't pay 25 bucks per get a 10 pack

273
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,809
for you 20 bucks so you know figuring

274
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:20,190
out what is a good good process here

275
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:23,730
took a lot of iteration

276
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,000
around and ultimately here's here's a

277
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,290
much more detailed board that I was able

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,850
to get out of this after doing these

279
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:34,589
tests and you know that's great

280
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:37,770
we've got copper and clearly uh places

281
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:40,590
to put our components we can solder

282
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,720
these on it totally works but we're

283
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,550
missing one key thing and this there is

284
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,230
no real good solution so I started

285
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,060
playing around solder mask right so

286
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,020
that's that green or whatever color

287
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:54,319
you're used to seeing basically it's a

288
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,660
lot like UV cure nail polish right

289
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:02,100
there's there's a solid film and other

290
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:06,449
stuff but the most part UV cured gel is

291
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,520
the basics of most solder mask one

292
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,520
common way of applying that is you know

293
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,850
put a sheet down and you're using sheets

294
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,020
of like transparency film that have like

295
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,730
black printed on it to block off UV but

296
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,880
you know you've got a mil so why not

297
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,450
just remove that right so I was able to

298
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,220
get pretty reliable results here and

299
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,260
here's the basic process I end up

300
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:41,520
settling on its first you cut out your

301
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:42,960
traces put some tape down apply the guru

302
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,910
you know it's gel right here this is the

303
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:51,060
UV gel and then scrape it with a razor

304
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,920
blade the scotch tape I put down here

305
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:59,010
kind of acts as a shim so I get this

306
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:02,010
nice thin layer of gel and I take a UV

307
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,540
LED this is a really big panel I started

308
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,080
with like a UV flashlight but I didn't

309
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,849
like waiting so you know I got this like

310
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,610
a 40 watt panel that just happens to fit

311
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,110
inside of the mill perfect right let

312
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:18,839
that go for a little bit and then up

313
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:21,330
pops a cured layer of SAR mask and then

314
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:26,339
I started just using the same engraving

315
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:28,410
bits here to remove the cured solder

316
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,820
mask from the areas I needed it removed

317
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,459
over the pads and you know work pretty

318
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,230
well but ultimately I discovered the

319
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:38,349
things called drag tips and again

320
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:41,019
expensive but I talked to a somewhat

321
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,449
local tool manufacturer and convinced

322
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:46,959
him to make a really reduced version and

323
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:49,540
this is kind of what popped out and this

324
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:54,849
is what it looks like so a drag tip it's

325
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:57,279
got this engraving tip mounted inside

326
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:01,149
like a spring mounted call it around it

327
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:05,829
so that allows the softer solder mask to

328
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:08,410
be eaten away and the copper is harder

329
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,329
so the tip kind of stops and hovers over

330
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,339
its you can't sit for too long but it

331
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:14,439
buys you more time so that you're not

332
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,420
cutting through that really thin layer

333
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:19,269
of copper quite as easily and this made

334
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,479
the process a lot faster and that was

335
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,480
great

336
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:31,300
and I was kind of the result right get

337
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:33,959
this and then you cut it out cut the

338
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,429
holes got the perimeter pull it out and

339
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,679
there we go that's you know that's the

340
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:43,779
the basics of what this process looks

341
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:47,350
like now one one problem with a lot of

342
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:50,649
these is a basically one problem with

343
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,869
all homemade PCBs is the vias the vias

344
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:55,240
are what transfer conductivity from the

345
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:59,410
top to the bottom so you get a hole that

346
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,809
goes through and the easy way is to just

347
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,249
put little tiny wires and solder them

348
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:05,319
into place on both sides and it's kind

349
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:10,329
of what you see here those little blobs

350
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:13,709
of solder I started playing around with

351
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:16,480
a couple different other methods using

352
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:21,640
conductive epoxy and stuff like that

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,620
these all were interesting it's not

354
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,699
super reliable all the time depending on

355
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:29,049
how much current you're passing through

356
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:30,970
it but again you can produce some really

357
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,190
good-looking results with it so you know

358
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,110
here it is the vias are hidden under

359
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,159
that solder mask and playing around with

360
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,168
a lot of different designs and

361
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,820
accidentally did a cross-section it was

362
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,760
cool because you get to see that the

363
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,250
conductivity of the top layer passes

364
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,560
through to the bottom layer just what we

365
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,450
were going for

366
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,639
this isn't good for just making you know

367
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,160
little prototypes and what uh when

368
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,980
you're designing things bread boarding

369
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,260
for instance breakouts are great but

370
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,510
that restricts use to you know parts you

371
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,520
can find breakouts that match right but

372
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,260
you know what if what if I just make my

373
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,250
own break out school like here's this

374
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,780
chip that I didn't have a break out for

375
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,710
it is fairly common you can find

376
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,420
breakouts that match this but again I

377
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,920
also don't have to wait for delivery so

378
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,100
that's cool I'll just make these in a

379
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,300
day or you can make you know custom

380
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,219
little breakouts like I wanted this

381
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,080
specific component it's really tiny

382
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,520
component that wouldn't fit in a bread

383
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,949
board or on here

384
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,270
I wanted that in line on USB for some

385
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:36,010
testing and you know this is what I got

386
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:45,070
out of it you can make full-scale a full

387
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:46,690
circuit prototypes we can also make

388
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,889
these little breadboard expansions so

389
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,510
again you got some really small

390
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,980
components you want to test them on a

391
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,140
breadboard oh you know how do you do

392
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,630
that especially when you want a very

393
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:01,390
customized breakout so you know here

394
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:02,650
this is our right and we get real small

395
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,910
here that one on the right on the red

396
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,850
that's a BGA component and there's a lot

397
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,660
of different ways to go about it I

398
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,629
started to playing around with the

399
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:16,000
solder mask define left right so instead

400
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,890
of bringing your solder mask up to the

401
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,350
edges you actually bring it over the

402
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,780
copper so that you get smaller detail

403
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,980
and that allowed me to do things like

404
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:30,780
this right so this this I think there's

405
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,790
a point four millimeters between each

406
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,960
ball here Center to Center point four

407
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,030
millimeters and that's you know really

408
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,500
tight and you can't really pull traces

409
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,570
between those balls but you can do

410
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,370
interesting tricks like you can see here

411
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,620
there's a ball that's missing because I

412
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,689
run a trace underneath and I use the

413
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:55,300
solder mask to kind of insulate that

414
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:58,000
layer so we get this very first

415
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,780
prototype this was oMG cable you know

416
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,840
the one that

417
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:08,690
in what was it it was 2019 February uh

418
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,879
you know worked barely had a lot of

419
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,250
failures so many different attempts at

420
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,080
this just just in that first month is I

421
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:20,240
started in end of December and early

422
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,070
February so I think it was like five six

423
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,870
weeks to go through the whole process to

424
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,159
get the very first prototype working it

425
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,750
just barely worked and that's kind of

426
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,800
what you see here that's a little over a

427
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,660
month of playing around to started

428
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,879
playing around with different approaches

429
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,220
of programming and you know I I lost

430
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,930
track but this is several months later

431
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,660
it's getting closer to what would

432
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:47,510
ultimately become the production version

433
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:49,100
of this know again the OMG cables that's

434
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,290
the you know the wireless connectivity

435
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,790
he's got a hundred times more space I

436
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,230
just I really wanted to see how far I

437
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,740
could take the concept like the eighty

438
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,810
tiny with its what like 8k of space is

439
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,660
cool but let's let's add like a mega

440
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,399
more let's add an 802 11 radio let's put

441
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,530
a webserver in this thing let's like

442
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,290
just see how far we can go

443
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:14,060
and that was the point of the oMG cable

444
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:15,440
right and you know we're gonna need to

445
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,240
start playing around here we're getting

446
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,620
close to production I need to solder a

447
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,290
bunch of these together let's get a

448
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,929
toaster oven and mod it and that's gonna

449
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:28,330
allow me to solder a whole bunch of

450
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:31,670
these oMG cable components onto boards

451
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,020
using solder paste you know basically

452
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,730
put that in the oven for a very

453
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,440
controlled period of time and it allows

454
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,560
the solder to melt and all your

455
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,820
components get attached get the family

456
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,730
involved too because you know things are

457
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,730
scaling up more the family

458
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,520
this isn't def kind of like nothing ever

459
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,150
stopped it was barely done in time this

460
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,830
is me still assembling oMG cables in the

461
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,250
hotel room and like heat curing

462
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,840
components and stuff uh but before Def

463
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,730
Con I said I had this idea of like hey

464
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,439
let's also make a whole bunch of the

465
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,420
eighty tiny versions you know they're

466
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,620
really low gray but you know they're

467
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,170
interesting to people who still gets

468
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,600
that concept of a malicious cable it's

469
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,450
not really

470
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,260
for field use but it looks like a USB

471
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,030
cable and it's malicious from a demo

472
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,340
perspective right but cool let's let's

473
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,480
make that on a whim there's like a month

474
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,439
before Def Con I'm gonna make a whole

475
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,670
bunch of those that's kind of what they

476
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,360
look like hand-assembled e is this this

477
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,030
sucks

478
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,379
um but basically the solder paste on

479
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,440
this panel and all a bunch of little

480
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,330
components is my wife helping with a

481
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,080
tweezer putting every little component

482
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:48,689
on every little panel and here's me

483
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,510
programming them on the airplane he said

484
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,370
we would call these demon seeds to

485
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,840
differentiate them from the Anki oMG

486
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,590
cable but of course nothing's ever done

487
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,909
time here's a whole group of people

488
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:03,090
awesomely helping me in a hotel room

489
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:05,760
pack all these into the little drug

490
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,820
babies that I chose to use for the

491
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,100
packaging that was great um everybody

492
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,120
loved it I was not expecting that little

493
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,959
$20 bags you know hand out kit uh

494
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,610
everybody was asking me after death kind

495
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,960
of like oh I want to buy these I want to

496
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,760
buy these and it's like well this this

497
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,760
was not something that I thought was

498
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,910
worth like mass producing and selling so

499
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,110
I thought you know what can I do to make

500
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:33,750
this better so I wanted to get a basic

501
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:35,699
wireless trigger functionality and get

502
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,130
data passed through working without

503
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,680
really adding any components and

504
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,780
ultimately I had to add I think it was

505
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,880
two more resistors to the entire circuit

506
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,120
I don't have to put a USB switch to put

507
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,970
an antenna or any of this stuff on air

508
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,040
and it it works the antenna kind of

509
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,840
barely works right but that's the point

510
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,580
it's more of an educational experimental

511
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,320
thing to play around with them which was

512
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,830
what everybody likes so that's kind of

513
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,060
where the the v2 you're version and

514
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,360
that's what this board would look like

515
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,399
and me this kit and I was like yeah you

516
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,100
can sell it on our site it looked great

517
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,540
cuz I don't care about fulfillment or

518
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,649
anything like that I just want to make

519
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:18,899
it then you get it you got these pins if

520
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,550
you can see right here bottom left

521
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,620
there's a bunch of there's like six pins

522
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,220
needed those to program it as part of

523
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,219
the kit right

524
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,900
sort you know certain count six pins per

525
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,350
bag that sucked so made this little

526
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,840
tumbler that's gotta a vibrating arm

527
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,969
vibratory feeders what these called you

528
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,560
know 3d printed this a lot of failures

529
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,730
but ultimately you know God we get this

530
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,760
working it was great and it would

531
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,260
dispense you have six pins at a time in

532
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,610
a little Dixie cup and we put all the

533
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,170
other parts and make a whole bunch of

534
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,169
little bags and see going on right here

535
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:59,820
packed a whole bunch of demon seeds into

536
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:03,120
you know hack five bags great um come on

537
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,030
screw picking place so instead of

538
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,350
tweezers let's use the machine to place

539
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,560
these little components on board so

540
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:17,219
start it here basic concept is starts

541
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:20,220
off so this this machine uses cameras to

542
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,890
see what it's doing and this little

543
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:26,430
white strip of paper hair contains

544
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:29,640
little components the camera sees it

545
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:33,330
lowers a little syringe uses a suction

546
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,280
to pick them up and then places it onto

547
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,810
the PCB that already has paste on it and

548
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,510
I'm testing here by placing on

549
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:43,950
double-sided sticky tape slow yeah kind

550
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:47,600
of worked first results things were not

551
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,190
aligned ultimately we got it there and

552
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,260
it was fast at this point you know a lot

553
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,300
lot faster than we started a lot of

554
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,580
modifications and we can see it you know

555
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,740
rapidly placing components onto the

556
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,679
boards

557
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:03,990
field of panels here it works um

558
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,880
the addiction keeps going of speed more

559
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,420
so you know I'm using a mill and a 3d

560
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,100
printer to make these feeders and

561
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,810
feeders would feed instead of putting

562
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,399
these strips of tape on the table and

563
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,590
have to carefully calibrate where it is

564
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,410
just have a feeder just kick up a little

565
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:24,209
component out one at a time and just

566
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:26,250
goes back and forth um oh this was

567
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,690
Christmas vacation with the family in a

568
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,750
hotel and we're like well we got to pack

569
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,700
all these oMG cables which had just come

570
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,170
back from the factory those components

571
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,880
are so small because everything is more

572
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,950
complicated here actually we had a

573
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,860
factory do it

574
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,240
and still have to test them and bag them

575
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,340
and you know that's basically what I was

576
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,870
doing in the hotel room when the kids

577
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:50,570
went to sleep and of course nothing is

578
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,250
complete without a really cool logo so a

579
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,830
year ago saw this cool

580
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,840
dust dust real made this awesome shirt

581
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,149
like man that looks cool

582
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,889
you must be logo huh I should do like

583
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:04,580
this you know it's thinking oMG and I

584
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:06,740
need a cable design right

585
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,110
my wife said that that just looks way

586
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,620
too phallic and I'm like oh yeah I see

587
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,260
it now

588
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:16,518
hmm that sucks but you know this was my

589
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,200
reply to her tweet the EM threw it away

590
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,789
you know came back months later when

591
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,250
demons he came back I'm like wait a

592
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:23,779
second maybe it's not an OMG cable logo

593
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,240
and this is the demon seat logo because

594
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:30,080
now our the the weakness suddenly became

595
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,580
a feature I said dust really exist for

596
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,139
me like it was crap and this is what he

597
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,449
made so this this was the demon seed

598
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:38,889
logo that popped out and it was great

599
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:41,539
like holy this is perfect man and

600
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:44,918
then OMG cable of course needed its own

601
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:48,440
logo cuz totally different result and

602
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,029
that's what came out and here a lot of

603
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,279
you know revisions he was making but

604
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,880
anyway that's kind of like the end and I

605
00:27:52,279 --> 00:28:06,250
still wanted to leave space for

606
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:06,250
questions do we have yo let's see MJ tho

607
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:14,870
sorry I said it was sick I always loved

608
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,760
your hog Rafi of razor blades just

609
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,939
around the place nice all right there we

610
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,389
go

611
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,220
oh yeah do we have any questions is

612
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:30,219
anybody in the chat any questions for M

613
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:32,419
G here Dean says show us the Furby oh

614
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,700
man I have to go running on the house to

615
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:39,830
get that the Furby I have so many ideas

616
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,049
yeah the Furby is this horrific I mean

617
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,120
we just want to make the Furby as ugly

618
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:47,779
as possible and just horrible as

619
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,820
possible for instance one of the

620
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,789
features is that just popped into my

621
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,698
head I think the other

622
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:56,669
is every time there's a general

623
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:58,589
sentiment expressed on Twitter that is

624
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:00,869
negative towards offensive security

625
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:03,809
tooling I would like the Furby to

626
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:07,228
release actual flies from its mouth

627
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:09,389
so I don't got all of that working

628
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:15,719
except for the sentiment analysis but

629
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:19,498
you know skill six is what's the next

630
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:21,239
step what's your next I never know

631
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:23,729
that's the thing everything is this like

632
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:25,499
I presented this in a fairly linear way

633
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:27,149
but the reality is all of those were in

634
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:28,739
tandem and they would come up and go

635
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:32,698
down off the you know the the work table

636
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:35,729
and I just had this table in my mind of

637
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:37,799
just things that could be or things that

638
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:39,779
I don't know what they're for I just

639
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,668
know I need them for later and they all

640
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:44,159
just kind of assemble into whatever pops

641
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,739
out um I've got some really cool stuff

642
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,179
that we have been chasing on the og

643
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:52,169
cable that you know hopefully we'll be

644
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,819
able to show off soon together I mean

645
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:56,849
there's there's refinements as well I

646
00:29:53,819 --> 00:30:00,178
mean I had like a 40% manufacturing

647
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:01,918
defect rate on the first batch of 'omg

648
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,569
cables so I think I've got that worked

649
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,579
out now but I mean that was huge if

650
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:08,158
anybody's in a manufacturing like you

651
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:09,959
know you've got like maybe 1% or 2% I

652
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,809
had like 40% and that sucked

653
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:14,519
