34
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,979
actually created the thing that we

35
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,059
wanted to do which was a slightly

36
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,929
forgetful Instant Messenger which uses

37
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,270
Python - Microsoft sequel server and UDP

38
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:09,270

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:43,049
able to but shadows to CTF circle one

47

48
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,650
screen here

49
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,880

I love zoom it's just awesome

51
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:10,180
yes this is our our scoreboard so CTF

52
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,750
circle has won with nine hundred and

53
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:17,439
forty one points which is uh awesome

54
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,920
followed by Gilda and JC ninety five and

55
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:24,519
thirty one I was trying to get did you

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,909
have circle people into our zoom as well

57
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,129
but I'm not sure if they are around but

58
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,840
yeah they definitely they totally killed

59
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,790
it a lot of people did really awesome

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,340
though thinks they already participating

61
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,069
because it's been quite a day

62
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,889
so shadows - CTF circle for going

63
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,780
through and rock and Matt wait you had

64
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,819
one more oh so they're the C T FD

65
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,790
probably already closed what I mean had

66
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:54,488
done this who would accept the flag okay

67
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,720
yeah there's aam okapi 386 yeah that's

68
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:57,790
close

69
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,739
so yes alright anybody who didn't get to

70
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,870
do that but we'll probably because a lot

71
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,819
of the challenges are still unsolved

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,530
so we'll probably reuse them or

73
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,260
something or re-implement them for

74
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,560
another CTF that happens sometime in the

75
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,250
future

76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,250
but

77
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,269
it's open denied the flag hmm yes ETF D

78
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,780
also is just kind of kind of weird and

79
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,769
tricky sometimes but but yeah no those

80
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,210

81
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,190

awesome loss out of some speakers became

84
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,710
clear we had a lot of really dense

85
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,880
technical talks that haven't seen things

86
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,739
like that in a lot of the virtual

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,760
conferences it's been really awesome

88
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,720

105
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:23,100
CTA via hackathon you want to real quick

106
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:26,380
just go over what your your thing was

107
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,440
yeah okay so I don't know how to use

108
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:41,100
zoom to share my screen sir let me just

109
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:51,760
check is it okay now

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:54,400
can't save my VM okay so this is a I am

111
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:58,000
for instant messenger but is slightly

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:03,099
forgetful it uses Python - and Microsoft

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,320
sequel server and UDP yeah first I yeah

114
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:11,289
first I want to show the demo to you

115
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:14,440
there's actually like isolate two

116
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:18,070
different users here so one is at least

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:22,120
and others Bob here is actually I don't

118
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:26,469
have time so here is the receiver port

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:31,300
and here is the sender support so you

120
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:37,479
have to know where to send which ports

121
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:41,500
you have sent your message so it's a

122
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:47,729
little bit Hecky you know yeah and some

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:08:18,180
of you may know why i i will not control

124
00:07:47,729 --> 00:08:22,030
my program okay you won't be able to see

125
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:39,039
the message right now but you can see it

126
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:46,780
on the look okay so I cannot control so

127
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm just gonna kill it right now okay so

128
00:08:46,780 --> 00:09:01,329
I just want to show you just the best so

129
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:07,980
here is Dori is just the Python code

130
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:12,720
Hecky Python code right here so it has

131
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:16,320
function start receiving center and I

132
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,860
created two threads receiver trade-ins

133
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,860
Center trait right

134
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:31,089
we just parse arguments and give

135
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:37,089
parameters to our functions right then

136
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:43,540
start start these traits you can see in

137
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:47,709
start receiver that we bind the port we

138
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:53,829
bind our socket and then the chat log

139
00:09:47,709 --> 00:10:01,869
text file so we receive we receive our

140
00:09:53,829 --> 00:10:05,469
message so let me show you chat lock and

141
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:10,160
then you can enjoy whitey cracker

142
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:13,640
yeah so this one is actually from a pan

143
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:17,089
because it's a pan mode it isn't in the

144
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,090
pan mode yeah okay hello from Aunt

145
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:25,760
Heather from Bob and here's I guess it's

146
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:29,840
just signal all right so that's mainly

147
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:34,939
its aunt I didn't have time to implement

148
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,920
all my all of my ideas here so what were

149
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,630
some of the challenges you were talking

150
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,740
about challenges that happened with I am

151
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:50,480
a sequel will be summation so I cannot

152
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:54,440
actually connect my Microsoft SQL Server

153
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,530
I just can't I don't know why all those

154
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:02,890
error messages are just so generic that

155
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:07,430
you can't actually find a reason yeah

156
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:14,210
also some of you may not know there's a

157
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:18,380
Linux driver for Microsoft SQL so you

158
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:23,410
know it today and yeah that's basically

159
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,410
it oh cool well thank you very much

160
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,430
struggles because yeah Python 2 is in

161
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,290
Weld and there's no support for anymore

162
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,780
so if there are any issues that happen

163
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,910
with compatibility or drivers or

164
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,579
whatever those are not going to be

165
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:45,260

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:03,610
um I actually third CTF sorry I've done

184
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:07,029
wanna tight defense and one other

185
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,889
jeopardy style and I I really enjoyed

186
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,619
the like variety of different challenges

187
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:13,689
even though we were only able to get

188
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:15,939
what is this seven of the challenges

189
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:19,709
there was still a huge variety in those

190
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:23,860
seven and then poking it all those other

191
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:27,128
challenges we we got a bit into the

192
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:30,279
two-bit crook a bit into we actually got

193
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:32,410
the flag for the comp I 386 but it was

194
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:37,119
either right as it closed or it just

195
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,829
wasn't accepting the flag no the RCA was

196
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:41,170
fun to Poquette even the ones that we

197
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:53,079
weren't able to get flags from I think

198
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:57,599
we all really enjoyed working on yeah it

199
00:13:53,079 --> 00:14:01,739
was mean it was cool because it looked

200
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,740
easy but it wasn't

201
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:12,429
yeah we got a flag right at the end and

202
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:13,749
it's it's a good flag awesome so yeah

203
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:17,799
what was the hardest one that you guys

204
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:20,110
did that we actually got well I'd say

205
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:24,100
the comp I wanna but seeing as we didn't

206
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:27,930
get points for that one member from our

207
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,060
team managed to do the TCM you

208
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,819
basically all on their own and I think

209
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,829
at least from what I saw of that would

210
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,490
have been the most challenging for me at

211
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,630
least

212
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:43,800
yeah the the parens is the one that I

213
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:45,630
had params or yeah I think the the

214
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,189
params one is the one where we ended up

215
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,950
having the most teamwork pulling

216
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,620
together to get anything though late

217
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,250
again with the comp I won we we pulled

218
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,440
together and choked pretty hard on that

219
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,640
our work on the crossword is the most

220
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,580
horrifying spreadsheet I have ever made

221
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:08,280
we weren't even close but I think I sent

222
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,190
it in the air-gap discord in the CTF

223
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,800
channel there's a screenshot of my my

224
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,590
spreadsheet and it's that thing was

225
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,650
horrifying to work on but thoroughly

226
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,360
enjoyable

227
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:25,800
thanks to shell for that I just wanna

228
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,860
make a quick I wanna make a quick note

229
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:33,300
as well about person who came in second

230
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:42,900
Gilda about two hours ago was saying how

231
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:44,729
drunk they were so yeah you know can

232
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
definitely killed it too but you know

233
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,270
there's a lot of people who do this it's

234
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,730
been awesome to see everybody working on

235
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:53,069
this there's a lot of really weird flags

236
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,600
and weird challenges same with this

237
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,190
which the show we try to mix up a little

238
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,050
bit different from what you might

239
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,300
normally see during a CTF for some sort

240
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,949
of other challenge so just everybody for

241
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,540
you know thinking outside of the box and

242
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,640
actually getting some fun even if you

243
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,319
got one flag all the flags are really

244
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:11,189
hard to get and there was nothing that

245
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,050
was like an easy win kind of thing so

246
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,800
