so um thank you everyone for for joining

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,279
this panel

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,400
we um i put i put a message out on

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,640
twitter said hey you know wouldn't it be

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,959
cool if we could do a pin like so

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,160
long story short this is what like 50

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,320
maybe 75 of the mainframe hacker society

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
it is a secret society of mainframe

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
hackers

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
uh we meet occasionally and talk about

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,480
our exploits

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
we are the driving force behind

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,480
mainframe hacking if you see tools

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
or anything else like that come out the

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,038
people on this panel probably had a

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,879
piece of it

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,160
if not one of the main developers the

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,160
the way this panel is gonna work is i'm

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,679
gonna be monitoring the the chat

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,919
and if you have questions for us i will

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,120
i will ask those questions to the group

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,559
um

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
first i'll uh i'll let everyone

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,839
introduce themselves and then we'll

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,080
start moving on to questions

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,320
so um real quick i'm soldier fortran

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,158
i do mainframe hacking i've got a ton of

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,279
videos that you can go watch on youtube

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,520
i'll pass it on to

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,119
chad who can introduce himself

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,560
and take your time chad yeah you hear me

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,799

um i do this for a living

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,320
so um mainframe security research

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
um and uh recently fun fact about me

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,479
recently i just

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,759
um learned about phone books so that's

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,560
pretty cool i'm pretty excited about

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
that

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,759
uh i'll hand it over to dan who on my is

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,839

hi dan helton um i'm ch1 kpe

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,439
on twitter uh i'm a consultant for ncc

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,240
group i do pen testing red teaming stuff

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,679
consulting during my day job and i'm um

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,199
not just mainframes but i'm kind of an

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
enthusiast for all kinds of obscure

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
computing platforms like i also like

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,720
uh ibm i series or as400 which gets

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,200
confused with mainframes a lot

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,239
open vms weird old unix i'm i'm into all

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,440
kinds of like

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,440
obscure operating systems

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,120
who's next everyone wants to go next

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
i'll take the plunge

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
uh this is david uh i'm not gonna also

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
on twitter

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,200
i work as a pentester red teaming and

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,160
stuff like that

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,119
and i do pentestinal mainframes and i

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,040
usually steal

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
stuff from mainframes during red team

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,679
exercises

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,040
i wrote one tool contributed to a bunch

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
of others

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,319
and here i am next one is

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,239
zbit31 i guess that's me so at first i

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,799
started working on the mainframe

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,519
it was like this very weird platform i

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
have never

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,720
heard about and i got really interested

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
like

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
and a lot of security was basically

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,079
security by obscurity which means

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
no one knows about it so it's safe right

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,959
so that got me really interested in the

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,680
security of this platform and that's uh

84
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
led me to here

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
all right henry your last we don't have

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,840
to close it up well i'm henry wizard of

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,720
zoz on the twitters

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760
um and henry cowper on the twitter um

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
yeah me and phil

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,599
started this secret society some time

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
ago

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,159
um at the start it was just him and me

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,040
now luckily we're

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,239
nearly four or four to five times as big

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,760
as we started out

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,680
um all round mainly 500 more

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,518
yes now those are some figures we have

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,400
the biggest figures ever chad

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,519
best figures the very best yeah all

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
round mainframe

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
junkie with um with the secret love for

102
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,280
all the

103
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,079
all the security related things let's

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,080
just leave it at that

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,519
okay great so um i'm monitoring

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,720
questions here

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
the i'm thinking maybe we start this out

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
with uh

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
if you could run us down how you got

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,920
into mainframe

111
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,760
mainframe hacking right like this is not

112
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,000
a typical path for information security

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,478
experts for people who like to do

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,400
cyber security type stuff getting on

115
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,479
getting to a mainframe is is

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,560
i mean i'll admit it's a little obscure

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,639
of a platform to be going after

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,160
so um you know my story is just

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
we had a guy from ibm who didn't know

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,639
anything and he was our security

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
consultant

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,040
and that made me scared just one guy

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
just well yeah actually he was the

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
catalyst

125
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,919
but i've met more um but basically

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
didn't

127
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,198
i knew i was junior and didn't know

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
anything about mainframes and still knew

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
more than he did about mainframe

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,919
security and hacking so um i'll i'll run

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
through

132
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,400
since chad's speaking up chad you can go

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,119
first what got you into mainframe

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
hacking

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,560
yeah so i was working for um

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,599
a big bank and i don't ever mention

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
their name

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
publicly but they have like a stagecoach

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,720
as a mascot so i don't work there

140
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,799
anymore so i can say that

141
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,600
and um they just had kind of an epiphany

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,919
one night that while i was doing some

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
malware looking at reverse engineering

144
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,120
kind of stuff

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,520
uh at the time i was managing a group of

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
of mainframe infrastructure folks

147
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,159
and i was like man who's doing this

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
stuff on the mainframe i know it's

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
important i've seen it go down i've seen

150
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,198
atms and points of sale and all this

151
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,440
stuff crashed before

152
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,120
um or not crashed but be unavailable if

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
there's a mainframe outage

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,039
you know who's doing the kind of

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,160
offensive research and so i googled

156
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
you know mainframe hacking uh and i came

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,199
up with

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,320
with the first name i came up with was

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,000
phil's and so

160
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
i sent him an email kind of out of the

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
blue like you do when you're in fourth

162
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,160
grade like

163
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,479
hey i'm in the mainframe hacking are you

164
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,400
check yes or no and send it back

165
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,400
and if you've met phil he's super shy so

166
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,159
it took him forever to respond to me but

167
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
he finally got back to me

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
and then like three months later we got

169
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,719
married in vegas and did a show

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,440
at defcon and talked and kind of the

171
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,199
rest is history

172
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,479
that's it that's the whole story and now

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,720
i do this for a living

174
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,560
but i want to hear henry's story yeah

175
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
henry you're up

176
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,080
i just had i saw a question from chad

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,440
here it says there is no cloud it's

178
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,680
other people's computers chad fabulous

179
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
um yeah well how i got into mainframe

180
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
hacking the i think the bigger story is

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,080
how i got into mainframes um

182
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,560
i was being a very nice student at

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,359
school

184
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,120
pre y2k and i don't know how it is in

185
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,039
the states but back in europe

186
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,280
the years just before the y2k were crazy

187
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,560
on job offering things so i did a couple

188
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,359
of interviews

189
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,720
and took a job at an insurance company

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,240
and they said well

191
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,919
you know we're going to have to teach

192
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
you pl1 because you're going to have to

193
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,280
program on this

194
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
mainframe thing for just a little while

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,198
but we're going to migrate everything to

196
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,440
net and then you can work on the latest

197
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,919
and greatest tech stuff

198
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,280
turned out i'm still working on the

199
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,198
mainframe and

200
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,719
net isn't as big as they promised me it

201
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,680
would be back then

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,160
um i've always had a knack for security

203
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
more

204
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
breaking things and trying to figure

205
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,560
things out and

206
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,160
it was only when i got um

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,160
talking at one of the events that i

208
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
organized and we got talk and i thought

209
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
hey all these things that i've been

210
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,479
doing

211
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,800
they apply to the mainframe as well and

212
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,719
it never you know it never connected for

213
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
me that it would be

214
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
basically the same thing and because

215
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,318
because i do have the mainframe backing

216
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,240
it's maybe easier or harder but yeah

217
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,240
from then on it took uh it took a bit of

218
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,360
a of a high loop so it's yeah

219
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,840
cool stuff all right who wants to go

220
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
next

221
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,160
i already said a little bit of my story

222
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,759
right so yeah

223
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
basically just looking at the mainframe

224
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,560
and like i was already in the system

225
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,520
so i just found a lot of things like

226
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,199
where

227
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,560
this is not how it's supposed to work

228
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,680
it's not just because you don't know

229
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
something that you can't

230
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,440
uh that someone can break it like what's

231
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,719
what's an example what would you what

232
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,599
would be a good example of that

233
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
like a a data set a file that yeah okay

234
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,400
no one can

235
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,840
can list the directory so like unless

236
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
you know the exact name of the file

237
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,599
you'll never figure out

238
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,479
that's the name of the file right or uh

239
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,000
it's uh just like apf libraries like

240
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,639
never be more specific but

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,479
yeah okay yeah no access to csv apf is a

242
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
readout but like who's gonna be who's

243
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,800
gonna know uh

244
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,958
how to write an assembler program to

245
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,919
call this macro no one's gonna know that

246
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,079
so yeah it's open but who cares right

247
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,199
i'll i'll talk about apf in a second

248
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
i'll explain what the people

249
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,279
if you don't understand this guy this is

250
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,920
exactly how i feel every time i talk

251
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,160
with him

252
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,199
he knows a lot this guy there you go

253
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,279
uh is he's awesome

254
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
uh well everyone here is awesome but

255
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,720
yeah i think i present myself

256
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,160
uh i actually run before i could walk

257
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,040
i started hacking maintenance because i

258
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,480
hacked one

259
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,839
uh during an engagement

260
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,040
i used i hear some echo

261
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,279
i use my knowledge in unix based

262
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,399
operating system to escalate previously

263
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,640
a little bit

264
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,279
until i found in the z os side copy

265
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,199
of the racquet database which is uh like

266
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,240
your security database where all your

267
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,519
your accounts are put it offline found

268
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,600
that john the reaper

269
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
understands it crack some stuff and

270
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,760
escalate

271
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,160
and then i found fields videos and

272
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,800
documentation and and started learning i

273
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,760
think it's

274
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,240
an awesome incredible technology that

275
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,000
can do a lot of super cool stuff

276
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,600
so it's fun join us

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,560
damn so mine uh was partially motivated

278
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,399
by spite

279
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,079
uh my first encounter with a mainframer

280
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,760
was i you know before i was a pen tester

281
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,320
i was a security architect

282
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
and i was on a call because our deputy

283
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,160
sizzo wanted us to investigate like

284
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,519
privileged account management systems

285
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,519
and he wanted us to look at everything

286
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,920
like the windows domain

287
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
the unit linux stuff we had etcetera and

288
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
they're like okay let's talk to the

289
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,359
mainframers

290
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,480
and where i worked i think they were

291
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
mostly zvm and not zos but we got on a

292
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
call it was me and another guy who was a

293
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
former ibm

294
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
who kind of spoke their language a

295
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,519
little bit and one of them on the phone

296
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,560
i still know who it was because there's

297
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,959
like three guys and i

298
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,599
didn't really like i didn't learn to

299
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,839
like

300
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
recognize whose voice was which guy but

301
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,079
one of them got into a tear on us

302
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
because he's like

303
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
if you freaking security people come in

304
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,959
here and you uh you know

305
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,480
put controls between me and my system

306
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,599
and i can't get higher level privileges

307
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,959
when i need them and this thing goes

308
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,320
down and we lose millions of dollars and

309
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,880
lost transactions you know

310
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
this down for five minutes he toured me

311
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,279
like five

312
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
like five or ten straight minutes just

313
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,120
ranting i put the phone on mute and i'm

314
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
cracking up and i'm like chatting with

315
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
my

316
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,480
my friend the former ibm and i'm like

317
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
dude i thought the eunuch's graveyards

318
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,560
were bad but like they ain't got shit on

319
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
like

320
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,319
main princess frogs like these dudes are

321
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,839
awful chain

322
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,680
so then i kind of became like spite like

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
i want to own these guys and

324
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,880
that year was the derby kind year that

325
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
uh dominic white uh

326
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
singed on twitter did a presentation

327
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,560
there at derby con about

328
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
uh hacking kicks which uh we'll probably

329
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,279
get into a little bit more kicks is

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,880
one of the uh formats for like mainframe

331
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,120
programs i guess you could say

332
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,399
um that got me into it and then i looked

333
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,680
up phil's stuff on

334
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,320
on youtube watched his little

335
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,199
presentations uh eventually i stumbled

336
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,440
through

337
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
uh running totally illegal in mainframe

338
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,680
emulation i definitely did not pirate it

339
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,760
off of you know a torrent site

340
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,519
and it stumbled through kind of like

341
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,079
learning the ins and outs of it and got

342
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,160
to talking

343
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,920
more like to fill and chat online went

344
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
to the one that i think the first evil

345
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
mainframe course that y'all did in

346
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
charlotte

347
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,638
uh and from there i just kind of got

348
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
immersed in that world it's pretty

349
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,040
interesting

350
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,240
nice so um we got like one of the first

351
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,040
questions

352
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,720
so the question is uh does one have to

353
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
buy a mainframe to get started on

354
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,399
mainframe security hacking

355
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,920
uh i think the answer is no but we'll

356
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,959
we'll let the panel decide

357
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
and then what are some of the

358
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,359
alternatives is there kind of an

359
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,920
emulator

360
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,760
solution uh who wants to who wants to

361
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,519
tackle this question first

362
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,959
like for now going on from now i'm not

363
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
going to make everyone give an opinion

364
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,719
just

365
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,360
just put up your hands how about if i

366
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,519
take the legit um aboveboard

367
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,120
option and then i'll ask some of my

368
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
compatriots to talk about the other

369
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,200
things that might be out there as well

370
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,959
yes so um if you have the if you have

371
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,560
the luxury of either

372
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,638
having the money or working for an

373
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
organization that is willing to buy it

374
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
from you ibm makes an emulator called

375
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,199
zpdt

376
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:45,120
that's uh zulu papa delta tango

377
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,480
and it is a z architecture emulator

378
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,399
that runs on x86 in linux and it uh it

379
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,440
emulates the entire hardware

380
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,880
uh platform from a cpu perspective

381
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,040
as well as it it emulates

382
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,399
virtual disk and that kind of stuff and

383
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,480
it will run the operating system the

384
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,200
exact same operating system

385
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
that you can get on actual z hardware

386
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,920
that's how i learned

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
so like i said i worked for a bank and i

388
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,479
was able to get them to buy me a copy of

389
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,079
this

390
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,600
and i i loaded it up on this laptop

391
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,359
and taught myself all the things

392
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
about systems programming and

393
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
administering the system and

394
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,800
updating it and security and breaking it

395
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
and breaking it

396
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
and i can't recommend that enough it's

397
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,920
not it's not cheap but

398
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,079
um you know like i said if you're in an

399
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,199
enterprise or a company that's willing

400
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
to spend a few grand

401
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,839
on training it's not that expensive i

402
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,079
think it can be had for

403
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,600
maybe don't quote me on this no one's

404
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,120
listening to this right

405
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
i think maybe like four or five thousand

406
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,760
dollars a year or something like that so

407
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,600
it's not cheap

408
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,880
um but you know also by enterprise

409
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
software perspective

410
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,480
you know it's not horribly expensive

411
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,079
either um that's how i learned

412
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,000
highly recommend it because it has all

413
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,719
the new features it emulates the newest

414
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
hardware

415
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,639
you can get updates to the operating

416
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,120
system so if you have

417
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,199
the ability or just to spend the money

418
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,440
on it that is absolutely the

419
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,800
the you know the best the best way to go

420
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
about learning this but

421
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,160
there are other ways especially since

422
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,279
there are functions and things you have

423
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,079
to learn about features you have to

424
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,000
learn about

425
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
that are completely foreign to any other

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
platform so i'll let one of my

427
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,199
compatriots talk about other things

428
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,839
other ways you might learn

429
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,279
some of that stuff some of some of which

430
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,519
is

431
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,639
legal and some of which is on the bounds

432
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,680
of maybe

433
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,560
yeah who wants to talk about bittorrent

434
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,160
i won't talk about bittorrent but pop by

435
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,800
on the chat here as well there is of

436
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,279
course an

437
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,719
an open source emulator for the set

438
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,040
architecture that chad so

439
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,800
eloquently explained which is

440
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,480
in contrary to some people from

441
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,040
three-letter companies state it's

442
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,959
illegal stuff the software itself

443
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,000
hercules emulator is

444
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,199
very much legal software ibm even

445
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,839
provides

446
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,880
an archaic ancient version of the

447
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,880
operating system that we now call zos

448
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,839
back in the day we call it mvs

449
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,560
think of it as windows 311 or maybe even

450
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
dos

451
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,680
you know that old an operating system

452
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,800
but mvs 3.8 i think

453
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,599
um is out there in a community version

454
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,599
that you can

455
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
boot up and load in this hercules

456
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,000
emulator

457
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
no it's not the latest and greatest but

458
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,639
one of the

459
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
things people say the mainframe is bad

460
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360
for one of the things it's actually good

461
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,160
for

462
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,519
a lot of stuff that runs today still

463
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,880
runs on that

464
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,360
old version mvs 3.8 a lot of the

465
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,720
architecture things are still in essence

466
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
the same a lot of

467
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,240
i mean the the things like data sets and

468
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,040
files and security and

469
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,759
basic profile protection and all those

470
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,240
things

471
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,680
still run there sort of so if you want

472
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,480
to get a hang of

473
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,399
of how the system used to be i'd say

474
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,199
that's your your number one place to go

475
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,800
and then i do

476
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,880
hear things about stuff being

477
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,959
downloadable from bittorrent but

478
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,959
i'm not the guy to ask would you say

479
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,119
it's backwards compatible henry

480
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,199
like to a fault um

481
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,600
how would you rephrase that question

482
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,599
chad you mean

483
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
the one of the things i hear about and

484
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,719
about the

485
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
the platform on a regular basis and one

486
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,480
of the reasons why it ends up in

487
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
some of the conundrums that it does is

488
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,720
because of what you just said so code

489
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,120
that i wrote in the 60s 70s and 80s will

490
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,680
run on any version of the new hardware

491
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,720
so ibm make this platform backwards

492
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,279
compatible

493
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,399
to a fault right meaning that every new

494
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,480
release

495
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,160
has to at least run all of the stuff

496
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,519
that happened before you may be able to

497
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,800
create something for a new release that

498
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,040
doesn't work on old

499
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,880
equipment but the converse is almost

500
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,599
never true something that you

501
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,160
built um back when it was a 24-bit

502
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
system

503
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,279
will still work on the newest version of

504
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,079
the hardware today

505
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,560
yeah yeah i'd say if you would write

506
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,638
your

507
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,000
pop your calc assembly on mvs 3.8

508
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,120
that would run the same on zoes 2.3.4

509
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,359
today

510
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,039
a important note for historic history

511
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,240
wise is

512
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,319
zos or zos if you're not american

513
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
has kind of held as the name now for a

514
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,678
very long time

515
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,199
uh but ibm used to be in the habit of

516
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,880
changing the name about every decade

517
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,919
because it was like os 360 then it was

518
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,720
always 370.

519
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,319
then it was mvs and various forms of mbs

520
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
then it was always 390 and then they

521
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,639
finally did zos around the year 2000 and

522
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,200
that

523
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
stuck so far for 20 years we'll see if

524
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
they decide to change it next year or

525
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
some shit

526
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,559
so old-time mainframers will still use

527
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,000
the phrase mvs

528
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,120
and that's just synonymous with z os

529
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,360
that's actually a really good point

530
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,879
there's a lot of you might even find

531
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,719
system names like if you're doing like a

532
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,320
pentest or something you'll see

533
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,880
elpar names mvs to this day

534
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,439
because when they implement it if you

535
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,120
connect to

536
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,440
ftp it'll tell you you're connect to an

537
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,879
mvs file system yeah and now to the unix

538
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,919
version of ftp

539
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,640
yeah nmap still kind of calls it os

540
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,120
three it

541
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,080
still does i think call it os 390 if you

542
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,080
if you do like uh

543
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,440
yeah yeah i mean that's not that's not

544
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,639
anywhere remotely true

545
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,760
but um but yeah there's there so um i'm

546
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,799
i'm watching the chat here there's

547
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,200
actually you can run

548
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,440
you can run hercules on a raspberry pi

549
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,600
so like if you really wanted to

550
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
run a real slow mainframe or run a

551
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,678
mainframe like it would have run in the

552
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
60s

553
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,480
you can run it on uh on a raspberry pi

554
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,360
my first mistake when i first emulated a

555
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,679
totally legal

556
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,000
uh version of like z os 1.11 or

557
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,400
something was i only gave it like

558
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
a gig of memory or something in a vm and

559
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,919
like it took like an hour to boot

560
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
and then i figured out oh shit okay yeah

561
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,039
let me give it like three or four

562
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,039
gigs of ram and then it worked much

563
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,440
better yeah it takes

564
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,080
it's a beast but i mean you're emulating

565
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,080
a

566
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,639
really powerful operating system so

567
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,799
so we don't have any any other questions

568
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,640
right now so what i'm going to do then

569
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:10,400
is maybe we will share stories of

570
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,480
um everyone's favorite hack or tool

571
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,520
that they've written or used or

572
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,640
something they've done

573
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,639
on the mainframe who wants to go first

574
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,559
oh actually so i just saw on the chat

575
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
someone says it doesn't run

576
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,399
python i don't know if they're talking

577
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,440
about oracle specifically

578
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,960
but uh i do know that it runs python

579
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,360
in um in unix actually maybe maybe now's

580
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,039
the time

581
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,559
software yeah yeah we can run python

582
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,080
maybe maybe now's the time to go through

583
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,480
some terminology before we get too deep

584
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,159
into this and node 20 minutes in

585
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,240
so so elpar that's like a a host name

586
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,240
almost right like you you basically take

587
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,799
a a system and you divide it up

588
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,760
into various lpars um basically the same

589
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,400
as running multiple vms on like an esx

590
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,440
then you have uh apf so apf is the

591
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,960
equivalent of like

592
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,679
um a kernel module say uh if you can

593
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,280
if you can put something in an apf

594
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,679
authorized folder

595
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,280
then you can get to ring zero i know

596
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,720
it's called key zero but

597
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,039
for the people who aren't mainframers

598
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,440
you can so if you can get it into

599
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,400
a state where you can get to key zero

600
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,400
then you can own

601
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,320
on the mainframe and one of the ways to

602
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,440
do that is to target apf

603
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,720
folders to let you do that

604
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
um what other terminology am i

605
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,039
forgetting here folks there's the time

606
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
oh unix

607
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,960
so so the main op so like the main

608
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,960
interface is like tso that's that that

609
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,200
green screen interface you usually see

610
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,200
in movies or tv shows or in any of our

611
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,640
talks it also runs unix

612
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,120
so one of the the things that

613
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,080
people have mentioned uh especially jira

614
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,918
was

615
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,600
you know the gateway to mainframe

616
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,039
hacking is through unix because you can

617
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,080
do all kinds of stuff in fact chad's

618
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,360
first talk

619
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,918
at uh at defcon get the bingo ready

620
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,879
was um was talking about doing a buffer

621
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,039
overflow

622
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,000
against a vulnerable c program on the

623
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,200
mainframe in

624
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,559
unix right so so it does run unix

625
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,880
a lot of programs a lot of cool stuff

626
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,280
you can do in unix in fact on unix

627
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,640
so in in the tso world you have apf

628
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,918
authorized folders and if you put

629
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,200
anything in a folder

630
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,000
it's apf authorized in the unix side of

631
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,559
the fence

632
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,440
there's an actual bit that sets it apf

633
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,320
authorized

634
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,159
so much like you have like a set uid bit

635
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,600
you have a set apf bit

636
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,080
that you can sit in the file system and

637
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,639
now that program can run in key zero

638
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,199
so i think that's that's pretty much as

639
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
we're getting

640
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,720
into like hacking tools and stuff i

641
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,919
wanted to get some terminology

642
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,240
what else what other terminology am i

643
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
forgetting here folks well one thing to

644
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,679
over confuse our

645
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,520
five attendees to this call um you're

646
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,000
i don't think we should keep saying

647
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,240
runslin unix because it doesn't actually

648
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,919
run unix yeah it's part of the os it's

649
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,520
it's just another interface into the

650
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
operating system that looks and

651
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,879
feels like unix but it's it's not

652
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,440
running a unix kernel

653
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,919
so to say it's just an interface yeah

654
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,960
keep that in mind

655
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,400
and like um that's the reason so so unix

656
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
was included as part of the operating

657
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,320
system in the 90s

658
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,840
and it came with and it get brought the

659
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,360
network stack to the mainframe i mean it

660
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,959
was implemented before but it brought an

661
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,520
upgraded network stack

662
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,200
and that's why a lot of systems today if

663
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,840
you find them have mvs in their host

664
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
name

665
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,520
was because that's when they were adding

666
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
these systems to networks and

667
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,280
at the time the operating system was

668
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,440
called mbs and so

669
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,440
what do you do on mbs oh that's a good

670
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,440
question what about security

671
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,200
um what about security for mainframes

672
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,480
so there's three products that run on

673
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,840
the mainframe

674
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,679
rackf acf2 and top secret they all do

675
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,439
the the same thing basically the

676
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,080
operating system runs

677
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,200
and and it asks it asks the security

678
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,639
product questions all the time it's

679
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
basically a database

680
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,640
of permissions and rights think of it

681
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,720
like active directory

682
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,679
on a domain right so you're on the

683
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,280
mainframe

684
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,120
you're trying to do something it will go

685
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
ask the security product is that person

686
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,600
allowed to do that

687
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,360
and the security product has a list of

688
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,879
permissions in a database saying

689
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,158
yes no so on and so forth so um

690
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,000
rack f is ibm's product it's like

691
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,520
the majority of the market today and

692
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,480
then you have broadcom's

693
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,840
uh acf2 and top secret which make up and

694
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,559
there's very the commands are different

695
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,080
but the security controls are the same

696
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,200
with within reason i don't want i mean

697
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,399
we can get we can get into like a

698
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,919
detailed discussion about how

699
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,159
acf 2 handles uh uss or unix

700
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,440
or ombs which is the same thing all

701
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,480
three of those things is one thing um

702
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,840
the same but i don't think people want

703
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,360
to hear that for an hour

704
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,320
so so any other any other

705
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,080
terminology so is rack f system wide or

706
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
specific to each lpar anyone

707
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,439
i'll i'll let someone else answer the

708
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,158
question

709
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,159
this depends

710
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,000
it depends oh god the most mainframer

711
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,120
answer

712
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,200
right i mean rocket the racquet system

713
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,279
is specific to your

714
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,600
environment right and such a mainframe

715
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,799
environment can consist of a single lpar

716
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,918
think single node single image but it

717
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,120
can also span

718
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,200
multiple lpars which can then even span

719
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,039
multiple physical machines and

720
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
geographic locations

721
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,039
but it's it's for a system and the

722
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,679
system can be compromised of either one

723
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,520
lpar

724
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,520
or more lpars

725
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
it would but as long as you have this

726
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,679
this sysplex thing you know where we

727
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
have multiple instances

728
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,360
operating together to form a single

729
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,440
logical

730
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,719
system view to the end user and the

731
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,440
applications

732
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,000
then yes the rakef runs for that whole

733
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,400
ensemble

734
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
of things

735
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,799
okay uh good follow-up question um

736
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:59,279
what is the biggest flaw with mainframes

737
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,840
and what do you go for uh jira why don't

738
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,840
you go first

739
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,080
oh i'm still typing away

740
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,799
anybody else want to tackle that

741
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,480
question

742
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,919
i mean honestly the biggest thing i see

743
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,159
on a regular basis is the

744
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:24,640
uh um it's sad but it's really the

745
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,600
a lot of the basics i mean we got people

746
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
who

747
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,918
know mainframe security really well um

748
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,440
but don't have any don't have a real

749
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,440
good concept of let's see how many

750
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,720
buzzwords i can throw in here like

751
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,840
today's current threat landscape

752
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,159
uh and so you know there are things we

753
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,000
see

754
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,400
where it's like look we've set passwords

755
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,360
for these things so it must be fine or

756
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,799
uh we're using self-signed certificates

757
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,320
so at least we're using ssl right

758
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,120
everything's good okay

759
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,000
so i mean there's a lot of basic um or

760
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
these people don't have

761
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,840
access to the mainframe so we don't have

762
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,960
to worry about locking down x y and z

763
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,480
uh a lot of the stuff we see are

764
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,039
our really basic problems um we do see

765
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
some more complicated stuff but i would

766
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,960
say

767
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,799
a lot of the stuff we see are still

768
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,400
really really simple

769
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,320
things that you would have had cleaned

770
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
up on a windows machine or a linux

771
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,240
machine

772
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,039
you know 15 years ago 10 years ago henry

773
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,880
i don't know do you

774
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,720
have a different comment yeah i would

775
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,159
say culture and complacency are the

776
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,400
biggest pitfalls

777
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,080
right the mainframe's so archaic the

778
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,320
things i hear a lot is yeah but who

779
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,600
knows how to do that anyway

780
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,760
um so it's it's a lot of

781
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,678
the biggest challenges are not technical

782
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,919
challenges it's it's mostly getting the

783
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,200
the peeps who run these systems

784
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,720
um aware of the results of when they

785
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
don't do what you tell them to do that

786
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,159
they should

787
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,440
lock down bolt down change configure you

788
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,919
know one of the things you said you had

789
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,159
self-signed certificates they will go

790
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,400
shouting through the office hallways

791
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,840
celebrating that they have ssl enabled

792
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,000
and i go oh that's cool

793
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,678
but it's a self-signed thing so how

794
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,760
secure is that

795
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,520
right it's uh it's more of the common

796
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,200
things and like you say um

797
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,440
stuff that has been fixed on other

798
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,039
platforms 15 years ago

799
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,200
not that it cannot be fixed on the

800
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,480
mainframe it's just not being done

801
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,720
right remember this um this this

802
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,399
humongous bug in the tso environment

803
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,840
where you log on to the mainframe you

804
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,360
give it a random user id

805
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,039
you don't give it a password you press

806
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,479
enter and the system says hey that's not

807
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,200
a valid user

808
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
right on linux and windows that's a no a

809
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
no brainer

810
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,399
that should be fixed ibm has fixed this

811
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,480
pretty fast after the

812
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,439
the exploits on this subject were made

813
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,559
public

814
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,159
um i still yet have to see every company

815
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,840
roll out that change in production

816
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,840
because they just they just don't

817
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
yeah go ahead we hear you now okay

818
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,320
cool uh i'm on the same boat of the

819
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,840
other guys uh

820
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,639
basically uh to add something new also

821
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,678
there are so many different subsystems

822
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,399
and

823
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,039
application servers and components that

824
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,320
there's no

825
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,600
expert in everything so your typical

826
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,158
mainframer

827
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,719
thinks that the unix is just a toy and

828
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,799
they

829
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,760
maybe don't care about it or even if

830
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,559
they care they're not

831
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,840
unix experts so they they don't know how

832
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,760
to secure that

833
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,360
or you have the unix team that has no

834
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,240
idea about the storage guys and stuff

835
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,240
like that so

836
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,399
when you combine all those little pieces

837
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,320
as it happens in the distributed world

838
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,439
you're gonna get pitfalls and issues

839
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,399
here and there

840
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,799
and and most of the time uh you will

841
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,279
find

842
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,200
that the common stuff so we're using

843
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,000
credentials so having credentials stored

844
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,440
in configuration

845
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,559
files and whatnot can give you a lot of

846
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,559
access because

847
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,840
you jump from one system to the other

848
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,799
you jump from

849
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,399
i don't know tso the green screen part

850
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,240
to the kicks which is an application

851
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,360
server from kicks you can jump to the

852
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,600
unix part

853
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,279
and maybe gain access to a database

854
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,959
where

855
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,919
where there's actually the money i mean

856
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,080
we like to to pawn things and get

857
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,000
root or in the case of the mainframe

858
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,840
special or operations

859
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,080
but you have to think that the real

860
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,678
money is in actual applications and and

861
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,360
the stuff they need to protect these in

862
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,480
actual applications

863
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,199
so when i remember the first time i had

864
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,200
to write

865
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,320
how do you test a mainframe i told the

866
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,880
customer well

867
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,760
take any network and test description

868
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,840
you have

869
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,000
that's exactly the same thing we do

870
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,600
information gathering we enumerate users

871
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,279
we map the attack surface

872
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,879
we start guessing we start breaking

873
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,520
stuff we start looking at the

874
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,640
things you have everywhere it's exactly

875
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,520
the same thing

876
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,679
with a way way bigger scale in a

877
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,320
relatively small box

878
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,399
and with a lot of computational power

879
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
and

880
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,559
features

881
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,520
okay so um what would with all this

882
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,799
nice high level stuff what when when

883
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,120
you're going after the mainframe when

884
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,840
you're doing like a main frame pen test

885
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,520
what specifically are you targeting um

886
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,799
i'll i'll

887
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,360
i'll i'll leave it up who wants to go

888
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,360
first with that

889
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,918
like targeting i can take that yeah

890
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,520
so which is exactly the first step i

891
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,600
usually do during a red team exercise

892
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,879
you look where they are located in the

893
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,439
world

894
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,799
you look at the weather or your calendar

895
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,279
and you start pastor spraying

896
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,000
around i i can i i live in sweden i can

897
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,480
promise you

898
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
here if the winter is long and ugly

899
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,600
people love summer

900
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,440
so i can guarantee you that in any

901
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,480
company here you will find someone that

902
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,320
has a password

903
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,840
made by summer and 2020 for example

904
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,600
the exact same thing happens in the

905
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,279
mainframe you take summer 20

906
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,199
and i guarantee you will find one of the

907
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,600
accounts with that or

908
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,679
i don't know where are we may may 2020

909
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,959
maybe it's short so let's say may 2020

910
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,600
exclamation mark

911
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,279
something like that that's my go-to

912
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,158
thing because people is still people

913
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,760
they

914
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,360
they tend to take those shortcuts to

915
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,720
remember their passwords

916
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,479
and that's one of the things right

917
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,519
mostly mainframe passwords are limited

918
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,320
to eight characters

919
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,840
so that's a really short password this

920
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,840
day and age

921
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,799
that's actually kind of a a pretty

922
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,360
important point i hear this on the

923
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,960
online all the time like well we're

924
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,240
we're using this banking system blah

925
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,600
blah blah and

926
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,679
and they force you to only use eight

927
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,639
characters must be a mainframe behind

928
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,159
that and

929
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,679
there may have been some truth to that

930
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,000
in the past that the mainframe

931
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,840
limitation was the limitation

932
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,760
for the online banking users but that's

933
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,519
really that's probably not the case

934
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,840
anymore it's probably not the case that

935
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,840
every online banking user has a

936
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,360
mainframe account right that those

937
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,519
those users are being authenticated

938
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,080
somewhere else not on the mainframe

939
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,120
however it is true that for for

940
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,039
passwords not

941
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,479
phrases but for passwords the maximum

942
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,039
length is eight

943
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,440
on on most mainframes you can use

944
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,120
passphrases but almost nobody

945
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,240
ever does so that that is a huge uh

946
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,479
to um just the point made earlier

947
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,799
that's a huge vulnerability right it's

948
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:28,000
just just the entropy the lack thereof

949
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:28,960
of passwords

950
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,600
chad since you're talking about

951
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,799
passwords what um what's specific when

952
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,639
you do a mainframe pen test what

953
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,000
specifically do you go and looking for

954
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,919
so we talk about the network like doing

955
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,960
password sprays what do you look for

956
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,880
specifically

957
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,440
um i'll tell you some of the fun stuff i

958
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,799
look for

959
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
um that maybe wouldn't um that i don't

960
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,639
know how well it

961
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,120
translates to other systems but um the

962
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,080
the the folks that administer mainframes

963
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,158
are generally speaking um they don't

964
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,840
throw and they never throw anything away

965
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,919
right so the first piece of jcl that

966
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,760
they wrote in 1962

967
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,200
still exists out there in one of their

968
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,039
folders and

969
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,399
honestly a lot of things i do when i go

970
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,360
looking on mainframes

971
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,600
once i've gotten through my normal you

972
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,918
know kind of list of stuff to look for

973
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,799
is i'll just start doing some big grep

974
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,000
like uh

975
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,039
searches on um like you know henry's

976
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,440
home folder

977
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,399
looking for things like password or keys

978
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,320
or

979
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,600
certificates or all this kind of stuff

980
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,240
because or

981
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,959
even like um you know copies they may

982
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,960
have made

983
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,120
of security databases and that kind of

984
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,200
stuff because they generally keep

985
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,799
everything so there's a tremendous

986
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,840
amount of information

987
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,918
uh in those folders i have found um name

988
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,439
and address files i found account

989
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,039
balance files from that one time they

990
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,919
did a conversion from

991
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,519
mastercard to visa and they needed to

992
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,200
save a copy of this so they just saved

993
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,000
it their own directory right

994
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,480
i mean this is just rampant uh the

995
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,360
amount

996
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,000
of personally identifiable information

997
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,439
and

998
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,880
security information kind of stuff that

999
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,560
i find in people's

1000
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:12,320
own directories uh i have

1001
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,320
the exact same experience once uh

1002
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,440
we had code execution be an application

1003
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,480
that we found on our windows box

1004
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,918
and i wasn't able to actually i was able

1005
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,119
to run stuff with the application

1006
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,879
account that didn't have

1007
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,560
any tso access no green screen access

1008
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,918
and the odd thing is so i said okay but

1009
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,199
i have some ideas i know where the

1010
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,199
mainframe is to start with

1011
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,000
i can start enumerating users into the

1012
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,638
spring i wasn't able to connect at all

1013
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,599
they had a very odd configuration of

1014
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,760
values

1015
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,440
for the non-mainframers logical units

1016
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
are like think like a

1017
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,200
tcp port on the application layer

1018
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,960
something that connects you to

1019
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,879
application via the network

1020
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,960
and i wasn't able to figure out that for

1021
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,918
saving my life and i found actually a

1022
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,560
copy

1023
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,598
of the configuration in a sysprog home

1024
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,078
directory

1025
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,960
and i found which i'll use i had to run

1026
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,160
there to

1027
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,880
gain access and run the other stuff and

1028
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,879
they were

1029
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,720
i know you find scripts script that

1030
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,240
maybe had credentials in the past they

1031
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,480
don't have it anymore but there's always

1032
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,799
a backup copy somewhere

1033
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,839
so exactly the same thing it can give

1034
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,839
you uh

1035
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,640
yeah they they are very very worried

1036
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,680
about tough time and not losing stuff

1037
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,279
so they save everything yeah that's the

1038
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,000
type of security by obscurity that i

1039
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,599
that i noticed

1040
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
like just because like no one's gonna

1041
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,280
guess they have you name like no one's

1042
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,920
gonna guess that this is the open port

1043
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,640
right yeah no that's not no that's not

1044
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,280
how you say

1045
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,279
secure things

1046
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,480
yeah it's just it takes more time but

1047
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,520
it's not that it's impossible to guess

1048
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,839
yeah admin password yeah i think for me

1049
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,680
the

1050
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:53,440
the uh the the faith

1051
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,640
that mainframers at the time like this

1052
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,839
is like five six years ago the faith

1053
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,920
that a lot of mainframers put in

1054
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,160
obscurity keeping them safe

1055
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,839
was misplaced and that's sort of what

1056
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,759
drove me

1057
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,119
to doing this do you feel like that do

1058
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,040
you feel like that was a conscious

1059
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,320
let's have let's have a philosophical

1060
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
debate about this for a second

1061
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,440
do you think that was a conscious

1062
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,119
decision that someone said like

1063
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,880
nobody fucking understood can we say

1064
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,560
fuck on this i think oh yeah right

1065
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,760
too late now you're dead oh yeah

1066
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,359
you can slurry elected okay uh so uh

1067
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,960
do you think that they made a decision

1068
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,560
to like hey nobody understands this

1069
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,079
fucking thing nobody gets their hand on

1070
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,520
them because they cost like hundreds of

1071
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,359
thousands of millions of dollars

1072
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,119
fuck it we're not gonna why bother even

1073
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,640
locking it down or do you think it was

1074
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,160
more like

1075
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,000
uh we have all these other things to

1076
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,520
worry about and it's super

1077
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,040
systems complex and we have all this

1078
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,320
other stuff and

1079
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,320
we don't even really know like we don't

1080
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,000
even know about what locking it down

1081
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,560
what what even would that mean

1082
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,040
i think i think from a leadership

1083
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,640
perspective you're probably right about

1084
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,400
we don't we've got other shit to worry

1085
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,279
about we've got all these windows

1086
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,480
machines that are getting hacked 24 7.

1087
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,200
let's worry about that we don't need to

1088
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,520
worry about the mainframe right and then

1089
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,560
but in my experience oftentimes you

1090
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,920
would even talk to

1091
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,000
mainframers about like no you should

1092
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,400
probably implement this security control

1093
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,760
and they would say why no one there's no

1094
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,119
the risk is nothing because no one can

1095
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,599
hack this

1096
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,440
i would liken it to selection pressure

1097
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,320
it's like the fucking dodo on like

1098
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
mauritius

1099
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,760
it had like no predators so it's just a

1100
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,200
big fat dumb bird it just wallows around

1101
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
that's what i don't know anything about

1102
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,960
what you just said there what was it can

1103
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,880
you translate that for me

1104
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,040
okay so the dodo bird which you know

1105
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,920
like uh the famous example of an extinct

1106
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,520
animal it was

1107
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,400
like i owned a mauritius in the south

1108
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,160
pacific it had no predators they had no

1109
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
selection pressure from a

1110
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,040
science standpoint there's nothing

1111
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,800
coming after it so as soon as like

1112
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,400
sailor showed up with like dogs and pigs

1113
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,760
they just wiped the bird out because it

1114
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
was just a dumb thing that lived on the

1115
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,400
ground that

1116
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,839
they had nothing to worry about you know

1117
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,839
if windows cost

1118
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,880
you know a hundred thousand dollars a

1119
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,720
year to run

1120
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,520
then no one would have like exploits for

1121
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,839
windows except like the nsa

1122
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,000
but since like windows anybody can you

1123
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,440
know can run a copy at home of

1124
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,760
basically the same thing that runs in a

1125
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,040
data center and same thing with like

1126
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,680
unix you know via linux and freebsd and

1127
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
all that

1128
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,720
there's a lot more pressure people are a

1129
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,279
lot more able to learn it and find

1130
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,520
exploits

1131
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,200
so is this you arguing dan that that

1132
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,560
security by obscurity does work

1133
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,919
well as soon as somebody takes their

1134
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,078
freaking eyeballs and looks at it

1135
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,520
because anacotta basically uh so that's

1136
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,800
a story phil's told many a time in

1137
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,079
different presentations

1138
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,839
uh one of the guys that found the pirate

1139
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,400
bay just got pissed off at his native

1140
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,078
sweden

1141
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,760
over you know all the legal threats they

1142
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,160
made against him and just said i'm gonna

1143
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
hack

1144
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,359
like some swedish companies like you

1145
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,640
know uh phil can go into more of that

1146
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,160
what companies they were

1147
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,520
uh he just like looked at a mainframe

1148
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,879
over like a week or two and like figured

1149
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,560
out okay here's like three oh days i can

1150
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,240
use to own them so it's like as soon as

1151
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,240
anybody's eyeballs went to it

1152
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,839
you know with that kind of attitude with

1153
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,680
the attitude of a predator

1154
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,799
you know of a of an attacker he

1155
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,160
immediately found things wrong with that

1156
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,160
and he was able to hack on three

1157
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,200
two or three mainframes have been proven

1158
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,480
i think there's another one that they

1159
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,919
think he did but i don't think they've

1160
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,480
legally proved it was him

1161
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,680
this is the most amazing like cast your

1162
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,320
eyes upon the system

1163
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,118
and ye o days shall appear kind of story

1164
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,119
i've never

1165
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,400
i've ever heard in my whole life that's

1166
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,000
literally what happened

1167
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,599
that is literally what happens lay your

1168
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,880
hands on the system

1169
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,280
and you owe days yeah anaconda basically

1170
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,119
over

1171
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,119
like a weekend just like downloaded

1172
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,839
hercules and found a bootleg zos image

1173
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,480
on

1174
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,119
it it wasn't a weekend it was over like

1175
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,119
a year

1176
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,480
or two he was in that system i heard he

1177
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,599
did it between lunch

1178
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,280
and happy hour i heard him god talk

1179
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,040
about talk about like raising someone up

1180
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,400
on a pedestal that day he had like some

1181
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,920
hard-boiled egg for lunch

1182
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,440
and he was meeting some of his peeps

1183
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,200
down at like b-dub

1184
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,440
three for it's hard it's hard-boiled

1185
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,520
eggs the euphemism euphemism for cocaine

1186
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,280
yes okay just making sure and then he

1187
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,400
had some wings with his buddies and in

1188
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,560
between there he found

1189
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,720
like eight oh days i'm i'm hoping one

1190
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,119
day dark net diaries does a whole

1191
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,319
episode like a five-part episode on

1192
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,320
anakata and logica

1193
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,000
yeah just and nothing about the

1194
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,720
mainframe just his daily habit in

1195
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
cambodia

1196
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,640
on-site in cambodia as he was hiding

1197
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,040
from everyone did he have like a hunter

1198
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,720
s thompson-esque like schedule like oh

1199
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,200
bump of cocaine like a glock

1200
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,799
diaper on the main train in other words

1201
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,240
the mainframe diet for sure

1202
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,599
yeah but i think i think the point is um

1203
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,598
i also heard the same argument at visa

1204
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,640
of like well you can't just go out and

1205
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,160
buy

1206
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,319
a mainframe and therefore it's more

1207
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,839
secure than windows

1208
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:38,079
that's why we don't have to be as

1209
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,520
as persistent as we can get complacent

1210
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,119
with controls because we don't have to

1211
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,400
worry about hackers attacking that's why

1212
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,520
we got started that's why we started the

1213
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,400
hacker society

1214
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,319
to help drive more people to actually

1215
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,480
give a shit about this platform

1216
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,839
in management and executive positions

1217
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,960
right i mean that's i think there's some

1218
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,319
truth to that right like

1219
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,480
probably not a lot of people out there

1220
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,839
that know how to hack say

1221
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,079
icbm launch facilities because

1222
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,040
you know they're pretty obscure right or

1223
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,119
ics

1224
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,560
not right well that's different though

1225
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,160
that's a little easier to get

1226
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,040
to um now it wasn't 10 years ago

1227
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,799
yeah no i absolutely i think that's i

1228
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,759
think that's spot on so i do think they

1229
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,119
benefit from

1230
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,960
some security by obscurity but in the

1231
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,880
in the ranking of things if you have

1232
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,480
like icbms down here

1233
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,880
and you know ubuntu up here

1234
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,520
then i think you know it's probably

1235
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,200
middle or

1236
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,319
middle top now given it's still a fairly

1237
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,000
ubiquitous system

1238
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,520
used in a lot of places and there are

1239
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,800
thousands and thousands of people who

1240
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,400
interact with it every day

1241
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,480
and you can still get one that's the

1242
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,160
other thing you know like maybe we can't

1243
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,319
afford to buy a brand new one

1244
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,759
but certainly if we're a nation state we

1245
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,279
could buy one on the used market we

1246
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,839
could buy a brand new one we could take

1247
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,520
it apart

1248
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,839
bit by bit right there's nothing

1249
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,560
stopping any of that from happening

1250
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,560
yeah there are 18.

1251
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:05,118
i just saw a very nice zbc

1252
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,440
12 on ebay for five thousand dollars

1253
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,839
i mean i i know some nation states who

1254
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,359
can afford that one fail

1255
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,960
yeah in my opinion

1256
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,240
bought one from rutgers university and

1257
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,400
just put it in his basement and learned

1258
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,399
it

1259
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,960
i think that the state right now is more

1260
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,560
like i don't know the

1261
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,160
phone system in the late 80s and 90s

1262
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,279
so it's big it's expensive

1263
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,440
they think that the technician knows

1264
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,200
about that on the other hand there are

1265
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,640
manuals available

1266
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,399
uh i learned a lot from the ibm manuals

1267
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,680
that are freely available online

1268
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,119
everywhere you just

1269
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,680
have to read them a couple of gazillion

1270
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,560
pages

1271
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,520
no worries and and you will figure out

1272
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,240
how to do that

1273
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,040
invitation right yeah exactly that's

1274
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,959
that's quite

1275
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,480
clearly a problem it's too much

1276
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,920
documentation but if you

1277
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,599
think like we think and it's fairly easy

1278
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,599
to figure out how to

1279
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:13,359
you can misuse features that are there

1280
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,800
so i think it's just first of all

1281
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:19,598
there's uh so if we take the

1282
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,720
common i.t person the mercury marketing

1283
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,760
they heard about

1284
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,879
is its legacy it's all this cobble that

1285
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,560
no one's ever

1286
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,359
updated since the 60s the people working

1287
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,839
with the main friend

1288
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,440
heard instead it's super secure it's

1289
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,440
impossible to hack because the

1290
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,480
architecture is unlockable because it's

1291
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,480
not like it's

1292
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,480
a normal machine with memory and storage

1293
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,800
and stuff like that

1294
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,920
so they think it's impossible because by

1295
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,359
design you cannot hack it

1296
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,280
while on the other hand there are books

1297
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,359
that you can read online for free that

1298
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,960
tells you exactly what to do

1299
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,040
the point is that you need a little bit

1300
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,160
of time but i think that

1301
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,640
everyone can if you if you're obsessive

1302
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,960
enough

1303
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,799
you can take you you start with master

1304
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,200
the mainframe which is a freely

1305
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
available system online and there's a

1306
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,359
contest

1307
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,359
that you can

1308
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,319
subscribe for but you can also have an

1309
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,078
account just for education

1310
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,839
and you start from there and then you

1311
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,560
read a few books and in

1312
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,759
i promise you you know in could be weeks

1313
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,680
could be a couple of months

1314
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,880
but you will find out at least one thing

1315
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,720
where you want to

1316
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,119
to grind your teeth on and maybe write a

1317
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,759
tool or start playing with it

1318
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,520
i think it's there's too much

1319
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,839
documentation that's the issue so you

1320
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,960
need someone to kind of guide you

1321
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,839
but it's possible it's just a a failsafe

1322
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,880
fails myth i want to say that it's

1323
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,880
impossible to hack

1324
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,960
they believed it's impossible to hack i

1325
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,160
think you read the impossible to hack a

1326
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,800
mainframe on

1327
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,359
quora stock overflow mainly list what

1328
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,400
not

1329
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,119
quite often compared to the number of

1330
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,599
times where

1331
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,880
the mainframe work comes off i heard you

1332
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,560
mentioned david i heard you mentioned

1333
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,720
cobalt isn't that the source

1334
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,759
of basically most of the world's

1335
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,799
problems today

1336
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,680
like base if i read what weren't there a

1337
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,920
bunch of really good

1338
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,759
articles out there recently yeah about

1339
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,560
how the state of new jersey's problems

1340
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,040
apparently

1341
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,040
isn't it yeah based on cobalt but just i

1342
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,319
mean i'm a hacker i don't freaking care

1343
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,359
about the problems of the world

1344
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,040
but i know one thing that is super cool

1345
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,400
you mentioned backward compatibility

1346
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,440
before

1347
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,520
and if you take your

1348
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,079
binary is compiling cobol you can run it

1349
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,160
on the latest machine or whatever

1350
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,079
uh what one cool thing is that since

1351
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,720
they update the machine

1352
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,240
and the compiler very often i think that

1353
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,359
kobold has a major release every two

1354
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,240
years and like a

1355
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,880
a rolling release every like two months

1356
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,720
four months

1357
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,480
something like that but anyhow if you

1358
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,879
take your source code and you recompile

1359
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,319
it

1360
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,160
you will gain access to the latest

1361
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,040
features of the compiler and the actual

1362
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,598
hardware

1363
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,079
and your code the same code you wrote

1364
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,319
runs

1365
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:05,359
from 20 to 70 percent uh faster

1366
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:07,599
so how awesome is that you just

1367
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:11,200
recompile your code and magically

1368
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,480
it runs faster i i think come on

1369
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,399
there's a lot of stuff in the main

1370
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,599
framework which is exactly like that

1371
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,000
oh memory and

1372
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,119
sorry i said i can barely compile c shit

1373
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,520
that was written like

1374
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,480
10 years ago can you imagine taking like

1375
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,720
your entire

1376
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,520
enterprise application written in c and

1377
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,118
java

1378
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,960
picking it up and just dropping it on

1379
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,319
hardware that's like 10 years newer than

1380
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,000
the hardware it was just running on and

1381
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,240
an operating system that's like

1382
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,680
10 releases later and it just fires up

1383
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,919
and works

1384
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,520
exactly that shit would never happen no

1385
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,319
not on linux

1386
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,680
not with npm not on windows no

1387
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,880
definitely not on windows

1388
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,480
um all right so it looks like we got

1389
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,839
maybe like 12 minutes left we got

1390
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,640
there's two two more topics we got to

1391
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,759
cover

1392
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,879
um maybe three uh cobol

1393
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,040
uh debuggers and like closing thoughts

1394
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,119
so who wants to tackle debuggers real

1395
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,319
quick

1396
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,920
i heard henry does no

1397
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,480
no actually test tso test is the only

1398
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,560
debugger you'll ever need

1399
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,160
that's like that's like the x that's

1400
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,279
like the edge

1401
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,598
right the fucking the worst um so the

1402
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,160
one

1403
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,599
the one that the one that so the the

1404
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,240
only one out there that is

1405
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,040
um really really good is a it's a

1406
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,558
for-profit

1407
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,960
operation called zxtc and it's the best

1408
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,760
one

1409
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,880
out there for for z os bar none ibm

1410
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,160
makes

1411
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,000
three or four different ones that are

1412
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,799
three or four different versions of shit

1413
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,400
um and i've done some blog posts on them

1414
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,119
before they're all crap they're really

1415
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,640
bad

1416
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,920
um i say that because when when the the

1417
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,118
audience that's listening to this is

1418
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,319
thinking about a debugger they're

1419
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,359
thinking about something where they can

1420
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,200
go in and

1421
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,040
sort of reverse engineer something or

1422
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,558
check out some binary that's out there

1423
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,160
all of these debuggers were were

1424
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,359
designed for people who have the source

1425
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,759
code to the thing that they're

1426
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,960
debugging right which for a lot of

1427
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,400
information security folks

1428
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,319
is not the case working on on radar or

1429
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,200
whatever that product yeah so we

1430
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,160
we are that has been a long uh that's

1431
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,799
been a long road

1432
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,399
because we're we're dependent upon um

1433
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,520
another

1434
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,599
capsule thank you another repo called

1435
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,480
capstone to basically make all that work

1436
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,480
um

1437
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,800
and there is also um i know for a fact

1438
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,079
the ida pro folks are writing a module

1439
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,000
for

1440
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,000
z to to work there but again that won't

1441
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,440
be live that'll only be a disassembler

1442
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,240
but it'll be fantastic because it'll be

1443
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,240
ida but

1444
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,000
and we had someone binary ninja at

1445
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,319
someone added uh unix support

1446
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,440
someone from the hacker society i won't

1447
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,920
i don't know if they want that

1448
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,720
out there name but um they added support

1449
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,400
for unix

1450
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,240
binaries to binary ninja

1451
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,680
so i mean they do exist but they're not

1452
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,640
they're not great

1453
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,160
um all right i'll i'm gonna say um we've

1454
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,598
got five minutes oh wait you didn't name

1455
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,680
a product there chad

1456
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,760
like the specific debugger oh which one

1457
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,558
did you name zxtc was the one that i

1458
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,079
named that's like

1459
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,839
a actual product that's phenomenal okay

1460
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,359
and then um if you want a real good

1461
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,279
primer on reverse engineering

1462
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,880
stuff i would recommend you go watch

1463
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,760
chad's talk from black hat

1464
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,040
uh last year two years ago um what even

1465
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,800
is a year i don't know

1466
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,279
it was like times march minus days

1467
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,040
yeah um it's a fantastic talk about sort

1468
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,079
of like uh vulnerability hunting

1469
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,040
like to find a zero day um for about

1470
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,520
five minutes

1471
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,440
uh i'm just gonna open up the floor here

1472
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:36,000
thoughts on cobalt

1473
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,000
and how it's ruining our economy go

1474
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,160
kobold is taking you hostage because it

1475
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,680
can run

1476
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,118
much faster cobalt actually created the

1477
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,799
coronavirus i don't know if you know

1478
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,520
that or not but yeah bill gates wrote

1479
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,359
cobalt

1480
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,800
creation he was working on cobalt in a

1481
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,359
lab and he ended up

1482
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,079
creating the coronavirus instead of a

1483
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,960
program

1484
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,040
um that just basically um sums up your

1485
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,200
bank account and gives you a total

1486
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,240
mm-hmm yep that's kind of cool runs 5g

1487
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,720
so

1488
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,919
yeah oh it does it is all cobalt is 5g

1489
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,160
now

1490
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,920
um we're making fun because there's a

1491
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,160
bunch of like hacked journalists

1492
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,240
i want to say like two weeks ago who

1493
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,680
after new jersey came out and said that

1494
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,720
that they need help with their co-world

1495
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,200
because

1496
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,759
which was a may or may not have been a

1497
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,078
lie

1498
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,480
um they needed cobalt developers to help

1499
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,760
them get their ui system working again

1500
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,000
and um so a bunch of people volunteered

1501
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,040
and

1502
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,520
they haven't taken up any of those

1503
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,440
volunteers up on their offer yet but

1504
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,960
then every single technologist who's

1505
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,680
based in the bay area came out

1506
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,960
and was like dunking on cobalt as as

1507
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,480
hard as possible

1508
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,880
here's what i get in my 30 second on

1509
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,319
cobalt is this right these ui systems

1510
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,160
have been working for years and years

1511
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,079
and years and years and years and years

1512
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,000
and nobody really noticed or cared and

1513
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,400
they're fine and all of a sudden we have

1514
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,480
like a

1515
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:59,839
50x increase in volume and they tip over

1516
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,160
right so in my mind that's

1517
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:04,480
probably not a coding issue right that

1518
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,240
is probably a capacity

1519
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,599
uh uh performance and scalability issue

1520
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,000
and the other thing i'll say about this

1521
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,440
is you know there's

1522
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,440
there's no such thing as a legacy

1523
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,319
technology that is

1524
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,200
released that has new releases regularly

1525
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,680
right you can't

1526
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,359
you can't call it tesla a legacy means

1527
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,200
of transportation just because there

1528
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,359
used to be a car called the model t

1529
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,598
right like it doesn't and electric

1530
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,359
motors were created in the late 1800s

1531
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,520
you know like who wants to drive one of

1532
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:35,520
these fucking old teslas that's like

1533
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,759
has its roots in model t's and electric

1534
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,839
motors from the 1800s

1535
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,359
nobody says that kind of stuff it's it's

1536
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,200
the same kind of ignorance when people

1537
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,520
talk about mainframes and cobalt saying

1538
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,359
oh this shit's got it's written the 50s

1539
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,559
you know it's like i like to turn that

1540
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,160
on its head and just say look these

1541
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,280
systems have been running

1542
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,759
large and some of them have been

1543
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,920
neglected and not updated and they still

1544
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,200
they've still been running for years and

1545
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,599
years and years and years

1546
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,598
right so it's not an issue it's not a

1547
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,319
technology issue it's a

1548
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,720
management has not invested in people or

1549
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,800
has not

1550
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,720
invested in updated updating their

1551
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,400
mainframe or systems or whatever

1552
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,000
and now they're paying them another

1553
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,839
paying price for it i'll get off my

1554
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,960
soapbox

1555
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,400
yeah i think um for me the the

1556
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,680
a lot of the questions and arguments i

1557
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,119
get are why aren't they just moving to

1558
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,480
the cloud oh the mainframe can't handle

1559
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,000
this why aren't they moving the cloud

1560
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,280
and i say um if if it was cost effective

1561
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,920
to move off the mainframe if the

1562
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,319
mainframe wasn't making companies money

1563
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,160
and was actually costing them more to

1564
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,000
run and keep up to date

1565
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,359
and keep their logistics running don't

1566
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,720
you think a company like walmart would

1567
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,960
have moved off of it already

1568
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,160
all the giant philanthropic financial

1569
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,720
services company

1570
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,558
giving millions of dollars a year to ibm

1571
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,118
because the technology is shit

1572
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,640
like that fucking hard right that makes

1573
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,319
sense to you in your mind

1574
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,480
right like you get that right they're

1575
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,160
not paid on the like the how well they

1576
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
spend their money if that makes sense to

1577
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,240
you

1578
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,000
then go ahead and keep dunking on this

1579
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,680
stuff because otherwise

1580
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
you're a hack who doesn't really

1581
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,839
understand yeah everything works

1582
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,800
i'll say this it if if someone makes an

1583
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,558
update to a cobalt library like ibm

1584
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,400
that doesn't instantly cause thousands

1585
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,440
of websites to die and your netflix to

1586
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,480
go under

1587
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,520
unlike node unlike other pro unlike

1588
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,520
like there's going to be python 2

1589
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,640
libraries that corporations are going to

1590
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,599
rely on for

1591
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,040
decades right because they there's no

1592
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,319
they don't want to spend the money to

1593
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,960
upgrade why would they it works right

1594
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,839
now

1595
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,200
um so but imagine you moving to ubuntu

1596
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,279
20 and finding out none of your apps

1597
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,160
work because you relied on 2.7

1598
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,839
right that doesn't happen in the

1599
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,720
mainframe world you upgrade you buy the

1600
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,960
newest hardware

1601
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,319
you buy the newest software and your tax

1602
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,000
app you wrote in the 60s

1603
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,599
runs today and you don't need you don't

1604
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,920
you just don't need to worry about it

1605
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,119
that's often why companies don't talk

1606
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,920
about their mainframes and don't hear

1607
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,160
about a lot

1608
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,240
because it doesn't it doesn't make noise

1609
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,759
it just works

1610
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,558
let's also say that just cobol isn't

1611
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:01,280
rocket science right i mean no it's

1612
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,760
written so business people could could

1613
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,720
could

1614
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,240
helpfully help write code because they

1615
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,640
could understand what it looks like i

1616
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,879
mean

1617
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,000
if cobalt has any major drawbacks it's

1618
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,839
just super fucking verbose right like

1619
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,680
you know most of the sentences we've

1620
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,680
said on here are valid cobalt constructs

1621
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,599
yep so so we've got about five minutes

1622
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,920
left i'll have everyone give

1623
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,920
maybe some parting thoughts on on

1624
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,800
mainframe mainframe hacking mainframe

1625
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,079
security

1626
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,520
um who would like to go first i'll go

1627
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,359
always like talking

1628
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,640
um i if i can say anything to you it's

1629
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,319
harder when you're consultant like me

1630
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,879
but if you work in-house at a place that

1631
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,680
has ibm big iron uh call the mainframers

1632
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,559
bullshit

1633
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,078
because they'll tell you that

1634
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,520
simultaneously the mainframe is also

1635
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,359
fort knox but it's also

1636
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,640
a hemophiliac baby surrounded by

1637
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,200
february eggs

1638
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,879
so call their bullshit like you know oh

1639
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,558
if it's if it's really this

1640
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,760
this sensitive then we need to test it

1641
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,520
don't we need to make sure that it's you

1642
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,200
know secure and then also like well if

1643
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,720
it's as secure as you say it is then

1644
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,480
there's no harm in letting little of me

1645
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,680
you know freaking take a you know take a

1646
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,720
smack at it

1647
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,919
also happy derby day for everybody even

1648
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,879
though there's no kentucky derby today

1649
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,880
i'm still drinking juleps

1650
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,279
nice who who would like to go next

1651
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,880
pardoning am i closing i'll give you the

1652
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,839
the short closing i do on the

1653
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,040
on the talks that i do start taking it

1654
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:23,279
seriously

1655
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,040
right don't um don't shove it away under

1656
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,799
the carpet saying no we're the mainframe

1657
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,119
we are secure

1658
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:31,200
and if you're the pen tester guy who

1659
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,079
accidentally or

1660
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,040
on a job based sees the mainframe don't

1661
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,440
be told no

1662
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,040
right if i think like dan was saying if

1663
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,319
they're saying it's such a good fort

1664
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,720
knox fortress

1665
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,759
why can't i have a stab at production

1666
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,078
for testing

1667
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,160
right but why can't i run my tool

1668
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,960
against your production environment

1669
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,759
it might fall over what if somebody else

1670
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,200
does it

1671
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,599
don't you want to see that tested and

1672
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,558
that yeah keep keep pushing the boundary

1673
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,119
on it would be

1674
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,119
my advice

1675
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,359
yeah that's it that's uh that's how

1676
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,520
that's why i'm in this uh

1677
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,040
so much into this like i really would

1678
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,920
like to see the mainframe like be

1679
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,720
properly secured

1680
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,760
not just some go bs oh it's secure

1681
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,319
because

1682
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,280
no one can touch it right so that's the

1683
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,279
part i really love yeah

1684
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:27,200
a different thought maybe

1685
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,960
if you talk and explain to mainframers

1686
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,240
that you actually like the platform and

1687
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,520
you care about it

1688
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,598
they will become very very helpful

1689
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,799
there are still people that are super

1690
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,359
unfriendly but

1691
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:40,079
most of them they will light up and help

1692
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,000
you

1693
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,680
and and they have a lot of knowledge so

1694
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you can learn from them you can teach

1695
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,078
them

1696
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,359
it's going to be fun amen

1697
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,960
let them know that you're not there just

1698
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,799
to dunk on them that you want to help

1699
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,559
them you you respect the platform you

1700
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,200
know it's not legacy like every more on

1701
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,720
things

1702
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,558
and that you want to make the platform

1703
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,040
better you don't want to just you know

1704
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,799
dunk on them yeah look this whole i mean

1705
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,359
we spent a lot of this panel

1706
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,359
dunking on on main framework but we're

1707
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,279
all here because we love the platform

1708
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,799
and we want to see it treated with the

1709
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,240
same amount of respect

1710
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,079
that the other platforms get from a

1711
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,759
cyber security perspective right we

1712
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,480
don't want to see i we don't want to see

1713
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,359
articles like

1714
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,160
like this 60 year old platform got

1715
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,000
hacked

1716
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,359
and now all your data is out there right

1717
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,960
like we don't want to see those articles

1718
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,680
we want to see

1719
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,040
it treated and and treated with the same

1720
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,319
respect you would treat

1721
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,000
just the other systems um and with that

1722
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,079

00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,680
probably won't be

1777
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,040
too surprising but getting there will be

1778
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,319
so we're just going to quickly stop the

1779

stream and we're going to restart it

1780
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:29,119
again and we'll uh
