yeah it's a good morning other side of

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,010
the planet and probably this side of the

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,980
planet as well everyone my name's Casey

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,840
Ellis and clearly the coffee is kicking

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,240
in but we shall get there with that

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,210
stoked to be on air gap thanks guys for

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,890
for inviting me onto this one just

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,689
looking at the lineup and a lot of stuff

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,250
looking forward to watch some more of

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,810
the videos today and go back through the

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,910
ones it's just a killer group of people

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,529
giving talks and thought crowds always a

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,779
good time Farrow yes and today we're

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,170
going to talk about squeeze-out Vaughn

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,219
disclosure and happy safe harbor in 2020

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,630
some stuff that we've been doing just

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,579
sort of taking you guys through where

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,610
it's all out what we're trying to do to

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,500
make things that are and and how you

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,340
know basically everyone can help at this

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,170
point so by way of introduction as the

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,300
hustle and there's the hack my name is

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,730
Casey I'm the founder chairman and CEO

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,440
of Bhakra basically started the the

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,019
crowdsource security is a platform

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,959
industry about eight years ago from here

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,309
in Sydney and then went across to San

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,870
Francisco and grew the company there

29
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,789
we're back here at the moment because we

30
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,590
kind of bugged out walk up and play it

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,869
out but to intend on getting back over

32
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,880
there sometime soon my back story is

33
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,580
basically hacker through the pen test

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,899
through the solutions and sales and then

35
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,880
got in my head I wanted to be an

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,430
entrepreneur started working on stuff

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,158
and but cratis the the most recent you

38
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,650
think that that I've been working on and

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,009
obviously it's a it's it's working I

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,670
think the the model of you know going

41
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,380
out and getting the feedback and

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,909
accessing the creativity of all the

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,240
people to sit round the table wine to

44
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,920
help that have the skills it's something

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,539
that the the market and defenders have

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,130
realized I actually need it's not a nice

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,869
day it's like we're kind of if we

48
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,339
don't because there's a lot of bad guys

49
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,780
and we don't have enough good guys to go

50
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,520
around so how do we love the playing

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,020
field that was that was really the

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,350
thesis behind actually starting the

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,000
company in the first place but really it

54
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,399
kind of kicked off with with you know

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,520
this precursor idea of vulnerability

56
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,460
disclosure and and and hackers operating

57
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,619
good face identifying things trying to

58
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,299
help and that kind of connection point

59
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,610
between the breaker and the Builder

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,470
being sort of the essence of yeah the

61
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,610
the elements

62
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,100
kind of like the missing link in

63
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,320
cybersecurity this feedback loop that

64
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,850
you know with our adversarial feedback a

65
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,320
builder doesn't really know that they're

66
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,630
doing anything wrong because the

67
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,280
they're building works so how do we like

68
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,140
tighten that feedback loop and just turn

69
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,210
that into a normal thing so that's

70
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,399
that's kind of the the back story of how

71
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,800
we got here and yeah that's why you know

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,260
the hustle side of it and the suit and I

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,290
have the oxide of it that I try to try

74
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,670
to keep in play as I do the the

75
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,470
corporate overlords thing so yeah let's

76
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,910
let's talk about let's talk about kind

77
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:54,270
of what we're trying to solve here right

78
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:58,670
CFAA is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

79
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:01,470
in in the United States it's kind of

80
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,200
basically almost universally or at least

81
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,230
globally cited as the the granddaddy of

82
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,320
anti hacking laws at least in modern

83
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,350
thought and the backstory behind CFAA is

84
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,280
that actually is a product of Ronald

85
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,340
Reagan seeing the movie ballgames one

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,100
time at Camp David and basically

87
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,420
freaking out like saying oh well I

88
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,299
didn't know that was possible we should

89
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,850
make this illegal going in and tapping

90
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,570
the DOJ on the shoulder and writing some

91
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,519
laws out out of which this CFA was was

92
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,720
essentially formed and I think you know

93
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,730
there's aspects of that that were

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,280
actually important to do for that point

95
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,459
in time and I think there's there's

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,830
reasons that still exist to make sure

97
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,510
that your actual malicious computer

98
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,700
crime where the intent is still

99
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,679
something that can be legally pursued

100
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,690
and it has legal you know opportunity

101
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,730
for recourse to but yeah really the

102
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,380
point is that most of the legal

103
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,840
frameworks that exist you know

104
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,940
definitely the CFC FAA and then all the

105
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,760
thinking and legal structures that kind

106
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,609
of grandfathered out of CFAA were formed

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,140
without this concept of good faith it

108
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,760
was basically if you're doing something

109
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,980
bad to a computer you're automatically a

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,289
bad person that's that's automatically

111
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,880
criminal and and you're automatically

112
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,790
going to jail if we if we catch you

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,019
doing that so I think you know really

114
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,020
what we've seen over the past eight

115
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,190
years bug bounty of on disclosure was a

116
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,780
very hard comms

117
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,340
to have it was starting to get a little

118
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,460
bit interesting a little bit topical

119
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,440
when went by crowd rocked up and since

120
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,109
then I think it's gone from being this

121
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,620
very novel idea to to being relatively

122
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,710
normal in security and in IT and I think

123
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,110
as well the the concept of of a hacker

124
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,270
being someone who's they were operating

125
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,670
in good faith and actually you know do

126
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,799
these kind of bad looking things but for

127
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,730
a purpose that actually like advances

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
humankind

129
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,650
that's better understood but still all

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,980
the work that we do exists under this

131
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,140
kind of overarching legal framework

132
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,970
where it's bad until it's proven that

133
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,650
it's good and really discuss I always

134
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,410
about trying to unfuck that particular

135
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,289
problem so here's our here's our kind of

136
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,180
history 95 a back story the Netscape

137
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:19,050
bugs bounty program they've dropped the

138
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:22,380
es eventually because it's clean up but

139
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,900
that's the the first you know computer

140
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,670
technology bug bounty program that's

141
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,190
that we've been able to find there's

142
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,860
this stuff you know back in the I think

143
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,360
it's the 17th or 18th century where

144
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,040
there was bounties around lock sport

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,750
which is kind of cool that you

146
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,630
netscape's the the granddaddy of the

147
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,220
computer version of that 2008 Facebook

148
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,680
started making a bunch of noise about it

149
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,140
2012 you know bug crowd kicked off

150
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,000
really as a productive conversations I

151
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,229
was having with pen test customers where

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,730
they were looking at what Facebook and

153
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,250
Google were doing and saying hey that

154
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,200
looks cool it's not just that it looks

155
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,510
cool it seems to make sense if we're

156
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,610
trying to outsmart an army of

157
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,039
adversaries then having an army of our

158
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,990
eyes just seems to be a logical way to

159
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,390
balance the equation and stop just about

160
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,669
you know the the the bay area kind of

161
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,740
kool-aid of the idea and it's not

162
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,330
actually even just about the fact that

163
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,770
it's morally the right thing to do it

164
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,440
just kind of makes sense from an

165
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,060
economics and was also standpoint so we

166
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,219
kicked off my crowd and started doing a

167
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,560
bunch of programs and really kind of

168
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,960
learning as a company what it looked

169
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,640
like to actually intermediate all these

170
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,760
different conversations and we realized

171
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,430
a couple of things you know the first is

172
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,000
that you trying to get a legal team to

173
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,740
write a contract that the company then

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,160
puts on its website with the internet

175
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,610
that says it's a

176
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,200
pay for you to hackus is hard it's

177
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,270
usually the first time they've done that

178
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,670
and one of the things that lawyers do

179
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,919
tend to do when they feel like they're

180
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,750
in uncharted territories or they'll

181
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,850
basically write war and peace every time

182
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,460
it's like okay how do we create as much

183
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,050
legal language to to cover off all of

184
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,900
the potential things that could go wrong

185
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,980
as as we possibly can because we feel

186
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,070
like that's the legally responsible

187
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,480
thing to do or if you know it's a

188
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,740
outsourced firm sometimes it's because

189
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,690
they're being charged by the

190
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,870
seven-minute block but that's a whole

191
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,610
other thing you know it ends up being

192
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,470
like a very very large and fairly

193
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,110
complex complicated document that comes

194
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,760
out because we are in the business of

195
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,050
unintended consequence right like know

196
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,659
these bugs were meant to be there in the

197
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,220
first place and the people that that you

198
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,320
know eventually find them weren't

199
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,970
necessarily expected to do that when the

200
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,599
when the stuff got built so lawyers

201
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:37,540
struggle with that but then it's not

202
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,740
just that it's it's the idea that like

203
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,530
hackers don't seem to actually be

204
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,260
reading the briefs which is like a known

205
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,719
problem still a known problem it's been

206
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,120
it's been a challenge for a long time I

207
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,850
think you know then being like long and

208
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,190
complicated as part of it but also yeah

209
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,930
a lot of the folk that end up working on

210
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,330
disclosures of bounty programs they're

211
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,700
English as a second language or they

212
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,280
don't have a legal mindset or a legal

213
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,620
background so the expectation for them

214
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,869
to go through and read the EULA is

215
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,760
really not one that's going to be like

216
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,040
it provides some degree of legal like

217
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,840
checkbox coverage but it doesn't

218
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,070
actually educate it doesn't actually

219
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,010
give them an idea of what they're

220
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,650
getting into and what they can expect so

221
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,230
there's that problem but then oh hang on

222
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,900
like if someone screws up things like

223
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,240
the CFAA things like you know DMCA in

224
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,650
the case of any state convention and

225
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,130
software that you actually hold your

226
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,689
hands those sorts of legal constructs on

227
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,610
a federal level in the US and their

228
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,169
counterparts internationally actually

229
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,380
makes screwing this up of potential

230
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,630
felony crime which is bad that's not a

231
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,120
good thing if if we're asking people to

232
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,680
help and then saying oh by the way like

233
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,370
just make sure you get it absolutely

234
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,630
right

235
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,390
otherwise you might be in a position

236
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,390
where you're illegally exposed like that

237
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,939
and yeah going back to you know CFAA

238
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,250
this is this is what the the kind of the

239
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,290
use of that that that law looks like you

240
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,970
know as a part of as a part of what

241
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,959
we're done with with bow crowd and then

242
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,910
there's a part of what we've done to

243
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,380
obligated to disclose I you know we

244
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,939
spend a lot of time talking with the

245
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,800
Department of Justice on this stuff and

246
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,330
there's a lot of people within the DOJ

247
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,910
that that actually do understand this

248
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,350
problem they want to see it resolved to

249
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,819
create the right kind of carve-outs for

250
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,440
good face but you know as you can

251
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,210
imagine they're a little bit busy with

252
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,600
other things at the moment as well

253
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,310
so yeah it is being used you see you

254
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
know a lot of these 10 30s are actually

255
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,310
against what you would consider to be

256
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,500
like legitimate computer crime with

257
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,989
actual malicious intent that would be

258
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,600
broadly agreed on as opposed to okay

259
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,410
this is vulnerability research that was

260
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,630
conducted totally you know in a way that

261
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,100
was clean and comfortable and even the

262
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,050
kind of vulnerability research that gets

263
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,850
a bit murky in terms of how that plays

264
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,300
out that stuff doesn't actually get

265
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:00,060
prosecuted at a criminal level against

266
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,920
ten thirty all that often but ten thirty

267
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,689
still does provide this pretty heavy

268
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,130
chilling effect on people doing that so

269
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,100
really you know the question we started

270
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,570
asking ourselves myself and Chris wrath

271
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,550
chemo my co-founder is like how do we

272
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,260
make this easy to do like we've got all

273
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,670
these complex concepts that we're trying

274
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,589
to still down at this point of

275
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,579
connection and everyone seems to be

276
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:25,860
having a hard time how do we simplify it

277
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,390
so in 2014 we launched a open source

278
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,780
vulnerability to scratch the disclosure

279
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,960
framework in collaboration between boo

280
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,069
crowd and a firm out of DC called cypher

281
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,740
law they do like intellectual property

282
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:42,150
war and basically keeping hackers out of

283
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:47,190
jail related stuff at the same time I so

284
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:48,959
27 24 197 and 30 triple one got released

285
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,110
paying customers that's the stuff that

286
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,450
like many in Katy Missouri Soros local

287
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,589
working on at that point in time so

288
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,120
there was you know we started a

289
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,800
triangulated around this whole like how

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,589
do you do this properly question which

291
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,050
was cool between 2014 and 2017 OS CDF

292
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:09,420
language the language that was in that

293
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,490
translated into I think four languages

294
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,740
that we've been able to identify go kind

295
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,690
of copy past it all over the internet

296
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,990
we've we've picked up snippets of it and

297
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,760
at least 500 or so programs and that's

298
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,670
kind of how these briefs grow it's like

299
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,290
oh the Facebook program like brief looks

300
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,479
good let's just take a bit of that or

301
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,060
just copy it wholesale or whatever it's

302
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,890
it's one of those kind of phenomena it's

303
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,839
a phenomena and legal boilerplate

304
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,460
language just as it is but especially

305
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,710
when it's actually intended to sit out

306
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:41,430
there on the internet so we noticed that

307
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:43,350
as a trend and then in 2018 of me hit

308
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,979
the talk circuit on safe harbor was with

309
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,110
hashtag legal bug bounty which was great

310
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,940
because what that did was really drove I

311
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,100
think a lot of awareness around the fact

312
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,320
that the safe harbor issue for hackers

313
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,120
is actually a big one that's not just

314
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,610
about how do you facilitate it's about

315
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,080
how do you make it safe yeah I think

316
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,790
prior to that most of the safety

317
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,500
conversation have been on the program

318
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,719
it's not actually about the hackers

319
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,880
themselves in the public in the public

320
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,620
eye like we'd obviously been focusing on

321
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,930
that a lot and trying to improve it but

322
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,240
a meet was was awesome in what she did

323
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,500
around creating broad public awareness

324
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,480
of the fact that yeah that's actually a

325
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,690
big part of the equation that needs to

326
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,750
be solved and yeah so 2018 we spun the

327
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:28,320
scores io out of OS PDF and legal bug

328
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,480
banning so basically join forces with

329
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,640
them and the folks you know Dropbox did

330
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,370
their safe harbor clause and it all kind

331
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,930
of went from there and yeah in 2019

332
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,240
background added disclose our terms

333
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,339
basically as default so when we when we

334
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,930
start a new disclosure program on the

335
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,300
platform or a new public bug bounty

336
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,770
program disclosed oh and the safe harbor

337
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,020
terms go on there by default it's

338
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,630
actually you know at the behest of the

339
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,630
the organization to trip off not to turn

340
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,810
it on and really you know we'd started

341
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,120
doubling down on disclose i/o as its own

342
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,839
initiative and its own kind of open

343
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,460
source quasi-independent

344
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,230
thing that is really pursuing this

345
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,180
broader subject of just making

346
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,920
disclosures safer but also making it a

347
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,750
bit worse few of you would would know

348
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,770
about this whole case because this is

349
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,020
you know what I was saying before about

350
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,020
temp that is usually been used for the

351
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,270
criminal

352
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,640
when they actually end up in the dock

353
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,290
what does happen downstream with that is

354
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,260
this kind of it's like heaven finished

355
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,930
there who's a phenomenal researcher and

356
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,840
a great great guy I was doing work on DJ

357
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,510
I essentially DJ I just didn't kind of

358
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,000
like what he did or how the conversation

359
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,470
went down and if you if you check that

360
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,800
letter out at some point in time the

361
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,150
language in it is incredibly strong

362
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,319
basically you know it was to the effect

363
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:52,720
of if you're not completely following

364
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,400
every directive that we give you around

365
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,840
what you can and cannot do with the

366
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,760
things that you found out with the drug

367
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,790
that you bought that is sitting in your

368
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,939
hands right now we're going to layer up

369
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,670
and do all sorts of fun stuff and and

370
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,500
really you know this shouldn't be this

371
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,839
shouldn't be an option this shouldn't be

372
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,160
an avenue of recourse for for folks

373
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,560
especially folks that have launched the

374
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,420
disclosure program and then decide they

375
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,099
want to renege on on components of it

376
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,900
and you know everyone learned a lot of

377
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,730
lessons out of that I think DJ I were in

378
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,810
a position where that actually kind of

379
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,070
come out the gate who launched their

380
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,930
program a little bit quickly and they

381
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,430
learning some things on the fly but the

382
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,229
fact that this was even possible in the

383
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,750
first place is part of the problem so

384
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,330
that's what we're here to try to fix so

385
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,690
yeah we did a survey actually as a

386
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:40,720
meeting you did a survey they came back

387
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,180
that 60% of good faith hackers don't

388
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,110
submit vulnerabilities for fear of legal

389
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:49,000
retribution for fear of things like the

390
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,900
MCA and see if I actually being used

391
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,030
against them and their actions being

392
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,490
interpreted as as having been conducted

393
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:00,069
in bad faith which means there's all of

394
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,830
this town all of this intent all this

395
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,770
goodwill all of this creativity that's

396
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,570
just laying waste because of the

397
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,870
chilling effect of the fact that this

398
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,310
hasn't been normalized yet so yeah that

399
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,720
gun is thinking it's like alright we've

400
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,430
simplified it you know people are

401
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,450
starting to read the briefs a little bit

402
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,890
better now yeah there's this sort of you

403
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,600
know there's some standardization

404
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,520
starting to happen in the language which

405
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,180
is which is good it's it's far from

406
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,590
perfect even today but it definitely

407
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,260
kick things off in the right direction

408
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,740
which was good yeah I kind of got the

409
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,029
the

410
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,709
peaking in the branding rounds like how

411
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,740
do we make this the adoption of all

412
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:41,109
disclosure with best practice of viral

413
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,300
trends like how do we how do we take

414
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,459
this so that it's not just you know

415
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,380
security researchers or industry

416
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,060
advocates or you know platforms and

417
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,010
companies like both going out there I'm

418
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,079
trying to drive this as a as a new

419
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,899
normal to borrow and overused phrase

420
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,880
it's being thrown around right now how

421
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,640
do we actually like have the market kind

422
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,580
of direct itself in that direction and

423
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,149
that was really what led to how we've

424
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,740
constructed discloser so the vision for

425
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,529
this project is is a healthy and

426
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,690
ubiquitous internet immune system it

427
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:17,230
needs to be functional and it needs to

428
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,270
be everywhere our mission is to drive

429
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,250
for disclosure adoption through safety

430
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,050
through simplicity and through

431
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,540
standardization because this is a

432
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:29,229
complicated thing to do I think it's

433
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,579
easy to underestimate that on the

434
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,410
researcher side of the fence I think

435
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,200
it's easy to underestimate that on the

436
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,060
program owner side of the fence because

437
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,070
you've got your one lens that you're

438
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,140
applying to the process whereas in

439
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,970
reality you know as I said before it's

440
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,189
all about unintended consequence and how

441
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,209
do you put all that through as orderly a

442
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:51,490
path as possible the components of

443
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,810
disclosure there's a couple of bits and

444
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,940
I'll run through these it's essentially

445
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,880
the terms which would strive towards

446
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,529
standardization of language get everyone

447
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,399
on the same page get them all singing

448
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:05,050
from the same hymn book make this as as

449
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,880
copypasta boilerplate as it possibly can

450
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,059
be so it just becomes like a normal part

451
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,860
of what you do as a as an organization

452
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,629
news on the internet and as a researcher

453
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,250
or as someone who's found something even

454
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,540
if you're not doing it research it's

455
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,300
like oh yeah I know where I can go I

456
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,720
know I can do that the list is is

457
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,329
essentially an open source list of every

458
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,939
bug bounty and vulms closure program

459
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,340
with an outlet find really the goal of

460
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,870
that is to is to drive engagement from

461
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,580
the community and to actually deliver a

462
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,459
network effect to people that are doing

463
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,800
it well and then the logo is to promote

464
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,650
the cyber security posture of early

465
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,659
adopters that you know they drive best

466
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,790
practice so safe harbors is the key

467
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,350
component of that

468
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,330
and really what that's about is like

469
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,340
mobilization and I'll get to how that

470
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,560
works in a second but those are kind of

471
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,439
the three main pieces disclosed oh is

472
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,270
the site for this there's a github repo

473
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,850
it's all very much driven around open

474
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,740
source for those of you who are

475
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,060
interested in checking all this stuff

476
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,210
out and actually help them be a part of

477
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,250
making it spread so let's go through the

478
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,100
terms the terms are you know essentially

479
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,720
a collection of boiler plates you know

480
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,179
how do you use them you can copy paste

481
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,210
we see organizations do that especially

482
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,730
smaller ones and ones that are kind of

483
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:24,060
more tech focused they'll just say yeah

484
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,730
that's fine boom gone done some use it

485
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,950
as a foundational framework for their

486
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,230
for their vulnerability disclosure

487
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:33,510
policy they might have things that they

488
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,550
want to tweak and change the specific to

489
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,940
their business but they can use these as

490
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,800
a as a framework it's also intended as a

491
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,100
starting point for new versions so at

492
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,590
the moment we're in there's global terms

493
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,409
there's US and Canadian terms this

494
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:52,199
actually terms that are specific for the

495
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,900
states to adopt around the u.s. 2020

496
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,550
presidential election and that was an

497
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,130
interesting brief too right but that's

498
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,810
up there and there's a couple of others

499
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,760
that we're pushing to but the whole idea

500
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,040
is that you know for folks in different

501
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,260
regions with different legal frameworks

502
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,990
like the laws that specifically get

503
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,000
called into play in Canada pretty

504
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,730
similar I think in in in how they

505
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,680
actually play out to the US but they're

506
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,390
fundamentally different as well so you

507
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,270
know making those tweaks regionally

508
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:24,240
relevant as part of what we rely on the

509
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,860
the community to do its contributed to

510
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,360
an assisted by lawyers program owners

511
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,050
and policy makers so really the whole

512
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,679
idea is that like we want everyone who

513
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,120
has a hand in this to have an opinion to

514
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,090
actually have the opportunity to give

515
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,979
feedback on these times and you know on

516
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,389
the right side here you can sort of see

517
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,050
where that feedbacks been coming from

518
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,030
these are company or organization level

519
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,710
endorsements of the project just to be

520
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,030
super clear about that but this is where

521
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,600
the kinds of people who've been

522
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,460
contributing to it work so this is the

523
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,679
sort of firepower that were accessing to

524
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,510
actually you know to drive this program

525
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,670
forward and it's it's awesome because I

526
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,080
think the people that get involved and

527
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,670
contribute on the legal so they can

528
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,620
understand the importance of this in the

529
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,560
value but it is all things considered

530
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,570
kind of a quirky problem to solve but

531
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,550
its ramifications I think on the future

532
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,860
of the safety of the Internet are pretty

533
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:21,330
big and people that get that really

534
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,770
really dive into it with the design of

535
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,740
the terms this is the part that made it

536
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,230
really fun with the the election piece

537
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,500
and honestly has made it interesting I

538
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:34,470
think for all of them it's an exercise

539
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,150
in in some pretty crazy balance yeah you

540
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,880
want the terms to be legally complete

541
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:41,070
you want them to give safety in both

542
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,010
directions so for the organization but

543
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,290
also for that but also you want them to

544
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,240
be readable and to enter be brief

545
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,220
accommodating things like English as a

546
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,830
Second Language and lack of legal

547
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,080
background those three things pull

548
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,600
almost completely opposite to each other

549
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,159
so landing it in the middle and being

550
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,280
able to say okay this is going to be the

551
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,080
thing that is adoptable enough to solve

552
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,460
the problem and to actually align an

553
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,770
organization around how they going to

554
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,380
respond to people like Kevin before

555
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,270
that's that's the main goal of the terms

556
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,770
so to have enough coverage to be able to

557
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,540
say cool I understand what's going to

558
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,650
happen here but also to drive alignment

559
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:22,020
and yeah it's tricky but here's the

560
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,300
terms I mentioned those before you know

561
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,700
really you know check to check the repo

562
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,230
out you know if there's stuff that you

563
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,820
can do this calls to action at the end

564
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,640
so I want preempt that but this is where

565
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,970
it all sits and we've just added draft

566
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,320
repos for Australia and New Zealand so

567
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,820
the goal this year is to get the five

568
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,500
eyes done because most of the people

569
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,850
that work on this speak English so we're

570
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,830
gonna stop that contribution and and all

571
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,340
of that is is really encouraged and

572
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,439
appreciated by everyone who's involved

573
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,110
alright so the list the list is like

574
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,840
literally it's a JSON list that sits up

575
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,189
on a revote includes like everything

576
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,530
that we know about at this point in time

577
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,770
there's some automation going into that

578
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,960
now we were encouraging people to do

579
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,970
more automation so like scraping

580
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,720
security text files for example

581
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,480
something that would just stop

582
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,070
see people get into there's all sorts of

583
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,539
other ways to do it but the idea is to

584
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,970
have this let's be as comprehensive as

585
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:21,129
possible and then almost to like trigger

586
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,020
a treasure on so that you know you can

587
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,960
see that there's a policy and an intake

588
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,929
form for a particular organization like

589
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,150
have you looked at that policy and sort

590
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,520
of figured out whether or not they're

591
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,799
they have safe harbor carve out some

592
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,929
lots of stuff or do they have you know a

593
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,418
bounty program do they have any kind of

594
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:41,980
commitment offer you know swag or that

595
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:43,600
sort of thing so it's just kind of this

596
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,320
repo the whole thing's licensed under CC

597
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,270
a 4.0 so anyone can use it at the moment

598
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,950
it's actually powering the list on the

599
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,408
bugcrowd website so this goes like a

600
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,179
repo with the JSON there we've pulled

601
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:56,980
that in and actually use that to power a

602
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,840
list that we've got on our page and

603
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,960
we're starting to see others use it for

604
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,720
the same reason so that's that's a use

605
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,700
case we've got a lot of bounty hunters I

606
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,890
think just kind of starring it and

607
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,809
waiting for new stuff to pop up and

608
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,539
actually using that power that research

609
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,789
as well which is pretty cool

610
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:19,450
this is kind of the barrel pot I think

611
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:21,610
it's the it's the logo so the idea yeah

612
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,490
the goal for this thing is for it to

613
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:27,309
become like the green padlock or like

614
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:30,130
you know for the Aussies a safety house

615
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:33,158
with the sticker on the on the the post

616
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:35,740
box for the Americans it's you know

617
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,970
neighborhood watch essentially it's a

618
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:42,700
it's a logo that ubiquitously signals a

619
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,590
certain thing in a way that directs a

620
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,539
particular response and a particular

621
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,000
behavior from the audience regardless of

622
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:51,010
who that audience is and just to explain

623
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,559
partial and full safe harbor there's

624
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,820
been some you know we accidentally

625
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:56,678
kicked off an equivalent to the

626
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,320
responsible versus coordinated debate

627
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,820
around the use of the word safe however

628
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,340
it's not safe harbor you can do

629
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,750
everything like no one would ever mean

630
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,539
that I'm not even sure why that's a

631
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,669
conversation but I think it explains as

632
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:11,559
well as it can this idea of like if

633
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:13,900
you're doing these things then you are

634
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,428
afforded these types of protections in

635
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,039
your conduct is as simple and as

636
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:20,020
difficult as that so partial safe harbor

637
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,270
is essentially it's a good faith

638
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,070
statement that's like if you do this we

639
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,629
agree not to pursue

640
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,408
the challenge of partial safe harbor is

641
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:30,939
that legal air cover hasn't really been

642
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:33,190
addressed at that point there's still

643
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,109
you know the potential to be pursued

644
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,200
criminally even if you're not pursued on

645
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:41,080
a civil level you haven't really changed

646
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,029
or authorized really the behavior which

647
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,639
is what's a full safe harbor is about

648
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:47,440
its explicit authorization against any

649
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:49,090
hacking laws like say FAA it's

650
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,690
explicitly exemption against

651
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:54,999
intervention laws like the DMCA it's an

652
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,559
exemption against acceptable use policy

653
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:58,570
attempts of service which is kind of

654
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,720
like what Aaron's law was was trying to

655
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,428
achieve at the at the legal level and

656
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,989
it's a general acknowledgement of good

657
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:06,489
faith so this is sort of how we've

658
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:09,580
divvied out like these are the blocks

659
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:12,190
that need to be there in order for for

660
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,840
you know these logos to apply and you

661
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,700
know honestly in order for it to be

662
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,289
considered as best practice I think by

663
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,929
the community and what we'll do over

664
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:23,769
time is start to add normalization

665
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:25,330
around disclosure policies and windows

666
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:27,669
and different things like that I don't

667
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,439
think that's mobilized enough yet for us

668
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:32,619
to push on that one but that's that's in

669
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,729
the Rope up as well and so this is how

670
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,119
it works like you put it all together

671
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:38,169
and you end up with this you know with

672
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,720
the whole idea of talking about this

673
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,609
going viral it feels a bit too soon to

674
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,979
to frame it up like that but honestly

675
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:48,009
that's kind of what we're trying to what

676
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:49,090
we're trying to get done here yeah so in

677
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:52,059
all starts of EDP

678
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,789
they had ads the list they get you know

679
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:56,200
they add themselves to the list and do

680
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:57,989
they have safe harbor or not if they

681
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,429
don't they see it because they've been

682
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:02,559
responded to from the lists not having

683
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:05,499
it they'll go back to the terms you view

684
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,149
them add them to the list then they yeah

685
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,710
you do have safe harbor that's awesome

686
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,779
they get the logo and put it somewhere

687
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,179
and at that point in time two things

688
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,769
happen hackers see it and say okay I'm

689
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:16,509
gonna try to help you now because this

690
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,729
is best practice and I feel safe in

691
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:20,979
doing that but the other thing that

692
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:22,840
happens is their customers see it and

693
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,039
then the internet sees it it's one of

694
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,599
these things where it's like you you're

695
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,090
actually doing the right thing I feel

696
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,189
more confident and more safe with with

697
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,599
trusting my data and my business to your

698
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,109
organization at which point they

699
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,029
competition sees it and then this

700
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:38,139
happens

701
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:41,140
this is really

702
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,910
see kind of go down like the whole idea

703
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,770
of like driving this is best practice

704
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,570
that's desirable for everyone to

705
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,490
actually participate in I think Vaughn

706
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,870
disclosure is something that everyone's

707
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,450
gonna have to figure out how to do it's

708
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,949
it's gonna become normal it's in the

709
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,750
process of becoming normal right now

710
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,440
we're trying to increase the variety of

711
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:01,840
doing it right and it's working yeah

712
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,430
this there's all sorts of adoption going

713
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,639
on half the pentagon's one that everyone

714
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:09,460
knows yeah kaspersky adopted scores io

715
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,770
as their policy as I mentioned we're

716
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,810
doing stuff with elections and so on so

717
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,730
what's next we want full coverage at

718
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,500
five eyes three or three thousand

719
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,150
programs with 30% full safe-harbor

720
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,370
adoption on the list and we want to see

721
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,050
the logo you know in as many places as

722
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:26,350
possible going for five hundred this

723
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:28,450
year and driving that one fourth-quarter

724
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,459
action for folks that are watching this

725
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,890
you know if you're in an organization

726
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,020
that doesn't have a PDP push on them to

727
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,060
start and like honestly you know bike

728
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,560
rack can help with this stuff but it

729
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,820
doesn't need to be us I think there's

730
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,139
all sorts of different ways to get this

731
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,090
going and the more important thing is

732
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,500
that this becomes normal and the

733
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,959
conversation between builders and

734
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,180
breakers can happen and just be a

735
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,220
normalized thing that's what I want to

736
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,190
see go on and then you know if you start

737
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,350
a PDP get the terms join disclose IO

738
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,910
grab the stuff put it up on the side and

739
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,330
actually promote the fact that you're

740
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:03,520
driving safety and simplicity for

741
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,250
hackers and for this conversation and

742
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,750
the reality that goes with that there's

743
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,570
always the opportunity to contribute the

744
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,220
list into the terms and you know

745
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,950
appreciate ever all the help we can get

746
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,570
on that one and yeah that's that's a

747
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,640
good one and then spread the word I

748
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:22,480
think you know every every hacker that's

749
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,030
involved in this from from a voluntary

750
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,550
contribution side of things also has the

751
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,020
ability to actually drive adoption and

752
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:33,399
make the internet a safer place as a

753
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:37,900
result so that is my spiel and thank you

754
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,190
again to the egg app hell yeah that

755
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,050
was awesome man yeah thank you so much

756
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,240
this is very beautiful stuff that we

757
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,280
wear a lot of people in the chat are

758
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,570
saying like you know it's awesome to

759
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,940
have this kind of language awesome that

760
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,710
was kind of thing and stuff like this so

761
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,360
thank you very much for

762
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,000
putting it together first and then with

763
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,010
anyway well absolutely appreciate you

764
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,630
just want to chase sorry a lot of people

765
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,760
just want to chase the EIP right there

766
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,250
like the head Sawyer in there in the

767
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,350
machine I forget that what they're doing

768
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,670
might be a problem

769
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,350
there's a whole bunch of fuzzy stuff

770
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,120
that's gonna be the precursor to that

771
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,350
conversation going through easily and

772
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,969
that's that's kind of the bit that we're

773
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:24,540
trying to trying to make a little

774
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:24,540
smoother yeah yeah it's good no money no

775
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,390
complex thing out there and I guess this

776
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,770
is a step forward towards solving it

777
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,870
yeah definitely it's it's interesting

778
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,940
because the the smaller tech companies

779
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,169
do seem to have an easier time adopting

780
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,780
this stuff because they could just bake

781
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:43,750
it in from ground zero like the the

782
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,879
bigger or from day zero bigger companies

783
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,770
tend to have to you know do a whole

784
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,900
bunch of cultural realignment stuff like

785
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,960
that and like that's honestly part of

786
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,610
the goal of this as well as to is to you

787
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,780
know to be able to promote internally

788
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,250
like yeah look at all these other

789
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,090
companies doing baby I feel like this is

790
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,730
totally normal

791
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:03,340
you can all relax it's not scary hackers

792
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,640
on the outside trying to it's just a lot

793
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,490
of how the internet works if there's

794
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,710
easy way yeah I mean there's it's true

795
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,300
like here's me with usual suspects and

796
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:17,170
you're looking like you just come out of

797
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,580
a silo or you're in a silo but I mean

798
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,050
you know it's it's it's one of those

799
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,610
things where it's like alright this is

800
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,159
best practice let's let's just do it

801
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:27,040
let's just make it simple cool so yeah

802
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:31,780
it's a good thing cool well thanks like

803
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:34,300
Casey and I guess the next week yeah

804
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,190
yeah Sam a night we got level up how the

805
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:39,580
flake fuzzing you know a whole bunch of

806
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:41,170
just fun speakers on that one so it is

807
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,480
the season for virtual conferences

808
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,130
levelup's been going since 2017 so we're

809
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,710
we're happy to double down on it this

810
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:50,640
year so it's become even more relevant

811
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,600
than it was before I think at this point

812
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,490
excellent

813
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,490
Noor is just guys thanks
