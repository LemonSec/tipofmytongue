1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
heard of this before twister shell is

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:12,150
basically twitch plays trying to hack my

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,000
server so if you want to I guess break

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,240
into this this is it if you want to try

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,619
to try your your luck you do it so

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,869
basically here's what's gonna happen

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,820
we have this box here and you have to

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:30,359
there's a file what's called like secret

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,450
dot txt somewhere on the server that you

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,540
have to find and you have to prove esque

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,550
via twitch chat so this is gonna take

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,750
we're gonna basically spin out of half

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,569
an hour about this and then we have our

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,960
next talk if we don't solve this by the

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,170
end of this 30 minutes we will be doing

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:54,360
it again later during YP crackers that

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:57,690
at the end of the stream so don't worry

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,680
if you either aren't around or somebody

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,870
isn't around or has to leave right now

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,789
they probably will be time later I don't

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,339
know people might be able to just

22
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,010
actually hack this box to then but for

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:17,640
the time being let's get started missing

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:27,210
a double check this works so watch this

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:29,159
not work but yeah so this is this was

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,658
pretty funny to watch last time and we

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,390
needed to give a lot of hints I think

28
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,450
this time probably the lessons

29
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,799
but uh we have more people playing so

30
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,869
you'll have to fly the little bit harder

31
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,360
to get out of life ah let me stop this

32
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,100
share real quick

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,649
but where my leading controls are there

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:02:02,009
there one second I have to just try to

35
00:01:49,649 --> 00:02:05,600
restart something Ryan see I believe

36
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,940
there is network access

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,570
but will it help you who knows

38
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:20,460
you're gonna download every known risk

39
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:34,700
Under the Sun please try one moment I'm

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:37,920
just uh just getting in here all right

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:42,299
one moment just double-checking this

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,708
works we got it

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,800
we did do the computers use the computer

44
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:51,450
all right here we go

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,730
so we're gonna do a shout out to the

46
00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:02,480
Duchy for your somebody sold you a

47
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:05,820
challenge you by the way the Duchy so

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,390
you can do this control see that if you

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,489
need to escape something so yeah this is

50
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:17,548
it

51
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:18,840
you can't remove everything it's

52
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,910
definitely not the first thing everybody

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,340
tries to do but now you have to wait for

54
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,910
it to finish with its RM before you get

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,910
to do anything else

56
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:47,480
so yeah this is pretty much it you're

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,480
gonna have to wait a second

58
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:11,109
so you should try to cat assignment dot

59

hello that's actually one about speeches

101
00:09:31,029 --> 00:10:00,130
later on so the point of this whole

102
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,440
thing is there your your Carter and

103
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:09,010
you're trying to prove that you are able

104
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,110
to be a part of this party and so you

105
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,630
have to have a bunch of credit card

106
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,850
numbers and you have to check by Amazon

107
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:19,480
gift cards with and that is the purpose

108
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,790
of happening now but there is a backdoor

109
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,060
somewhere on the system that will allow

110
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,279
you to prove ask that was something that

111
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,500
was supposed to be a monitoring tool so

112
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:34,990
how do you look for those things so

113
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,690
somebody's monitoring your box and it's

114
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:42,550
not everyone on Twitch what do you got

115
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,660
