00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,810
now

97
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:57,780
it's called chomped it's uh it's like

98
00:05:51,810 --> 00:06:00,450
the chops TV show it's like it's a we

99
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,190
basically have given people uh prompts

100
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,469
and there's four teams that are trying

101
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,160
to do them right now what is the actual

102
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,640
thing

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,140
it was so basically we got we crowd

104
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,260
sourced a bunch of ideas for things

105
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,289
people have to make so they have to be

106
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:20,039
able to like create something that is

107
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,290
that does the things that were we set

108
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,320
out set out to do using the technology

109
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,850
that we that we like have chosen and so

110
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,520
all this stuff is crowdsourcing people's

111
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,419
suggestions for different apps so

112
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,998
currently we have a

113
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,580
it's a home on an instant messenger that

114
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:40,619
is slightly forgetful which is like the

115
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,628
best thing I've ever heard and uses

116
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:44,249
Python too and Microsoft sequel server

117
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,499
plus a mystery ingredient that we're

118
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:47,729
announcing right now so you guys ready

119
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:52,169
for the mystery ingredient

120
00:06:47,729 --> 00:07:09,990
I am I'm very ready okay

121
00:06:52,169 --> 00:07:12,419
the mystery ingredient is UDP Christ

122
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,029
everybody who is participating that is

123
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,748
the basically they'll have the next six

124
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,308
hours to implement UDP into their stack

125
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:24,800
for some way to do this

126
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:27,419
Instant Messenger so good luck to y'all

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,759
that's it could be interesting with a

128
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:39,959
few ways I can think about going to I'd

129
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:42,779
like to see yeah yeah bad stuff but it

130
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,719
would definitely be more reliable hmm a

131
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:49,189
lot more reliable yes yeah the Microsoft

132
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:49,189
sequel server would become more reliable

133
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,639
so also we have another cool thing we're

134
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:58,289
doing too so we are donating up to a

135
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,879
thousand dollars in donations or

136
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:04,110
matching donations to people who donate

137
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,569
and masks for docs which is a charity

138
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:10,649
that is giving PPE and other equipment

139
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,330
that is vital to hospitals and medical

140
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:15,209
organizations that aren't able to afford

141
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,558
them in these times here we're trying to

142
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,509
do our part in support of smaller

143
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,889
charity is doing this kind of thing on

144
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:22,499
the been doing great work and donating a

145
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,219
bunch of masks so if you do donate to

146
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,110
masks for docs

147
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:29,159
just take a screenshot of your donation

148
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,159
and tear it's called tweeted at us with

149
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,208
the hashtag area at 20:20 and we will

150
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,610

yeah we uh like we all wear masks we

156
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:52,310
think other people should wear masks and

because we're gonna have our first talk

166
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:21,170
about 20 minutes which would be Luigi

167
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,290
blood who is gonna be talking about so

168
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,300
tell of universe engineering which I'm

169
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,149
they said before also other big thing

170
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,459
too we have twitch to shell which the

171
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:33,740
shell is going to be coming back for the

172
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:38,569
first time in what we did the first time

173
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,230
in in 1318 yeah yeah yeah so that that

174
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:43,519
was awesome

175
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,889
basically also read me probably can hear

176
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,079
us right now but there's something

177
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,819
allowing people to drop to 480p well

178
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,290
just figure that out so we're probably

179
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,050
gonna take a little break before the

180
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,089
first talk so we'll figure out any

181
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,079
streaming issues if anybody is having

182
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:00,439
some issues where they just let us know

183
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:03,199
and we will get it sorted before we

184
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:05,139
actually start the talks yeah you should

185
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:11,870
be able to control it yourself

186
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:13,880
we're just pushing to twitch like yeah

187
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,750
twitch controls whether or not you can

188
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,310
do only transcoding yeah Charlotte was

189
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,750
