1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
I've made it welcome hell yeah so we're

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,899
super excited it's Luigi blitz turn is

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,940
done for telling people versus

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,280
engineering so y'all haven't heard of it

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,969
it's a satellite modem for the SNES it's

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,198
really really cool history of it there's

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,330
a lot of really interesting things that

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,859
happens with the tell of you it's Luigi

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,310
but is gonna go and tell us all about

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,680
what he has learned and how he was his

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,710
approach to reverse engineering it so

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:34,680
super stoked luigi bud you are you ready

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:39,510
to go yep oh yeah take it away ma'am so

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,579
I I'm blood and I've been we'll talk

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,390
about how I ever since you need the

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,390
satellite view

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,149
stuff my ability to speak English so

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,540
this stuff will be like I will present

19
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:59,469
what the satellaview is then I will talk

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:02,379
about how I reverse engineer it someone

21
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:06,130
who didn't know really much of anything

22
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:11,289
and then I will talk about how it

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:14,350
actually works to hold that what we know

24
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:19,929
of it today and then pretty much like

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:23,440
what I've learned out of this process so

26
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:27,490
first I need to explain like what I do

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:31,750
for the most part most of my focus has

28
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,990
been about mostly obscure Nintendo

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,330
things so I've been working on Saturday

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,479
view I've been doing some 6040

31
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,990
preservation I'm in Mission and I have

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,780
done some leaders stuff in the past

33
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,589
hopefully I will get back to it and then

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:54,399
if you know me a little bit you know

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:58,200
that I have had done some CGI stuff in

36
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:05,100
the past with some HD high quality rips

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:08,140
and so my knowledge like in 20 in 2010

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,008
so when I started to reverse-engineer

39
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:13,450
Citterio

40
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:17,500
I learnt programming with basic the next

41
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:22,230
thing I've done was like a hello world

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:25,780
on blue for the Super Nintendo it was

43
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:30,130
quite a mess of code when I look back to

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:33,400
it and every time I tried to do

45
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,100
something I asked everyone all the time

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,140
I expected other people to do stuff for

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:43,870
me that's pretty much what was my level

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:49,089
at the time and it was also like I was

49
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,239
like around 15 or something just to give

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,019
you an idea of

51
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:59,909
was when I was about to do this kind of

52
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:02,790
project so now let's talk about the

53
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,920
Citterio so instead to review is a

54
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,189
peripheral for the Super Famicom that

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,458
allows you to access satellite like a

56
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:14,569
service by that was managed by Nintendo

57
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,250
and sent Giga you could end up games

58
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:20,310
magazines additional content for some

59
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,379
games that support it and you could also

60
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,419
listen to radio which was something that

61
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:30,810
scindia was pretty much all about and

62
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:33,840
some games also use the radio broadcast

63
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,180
as part of the experience is also I

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,629
think that Nintendo doesn't like to

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,540
acknowledge all the time some sometimes

66
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,399
we do release stuff and sometimes I'd

67
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,030
like to bring some attention like in

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,120
Super Mario DC but most of the time

69
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,590
reserves don't talk about it

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:58,199
so one of the main reasons why I was

71
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,019
into a Saturday deal was very detains

72
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,060
there were many like original games that

73
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,669
came out for it

74
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:11,479
between a news of the game a remake of

75
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,479
the fizzled but somewhat different way

76
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:18,298
there was also some Mario games some

77
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:21,900
really obscure stuff that we never see

78
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,299
anywhere else some games like radical

79
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:29,690
dreamers which was a sort of Chrono

80
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:34,560
Cross some kind of Chrono Cross prequel

81
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:38,729
rather a draft of the game that was that

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,550
we did not consider you and then there

83
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,889
are tons of other original games that

84
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,470
came out for it and some things

85
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:53,610
sometimes we will release on as a

86
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:54,270
cartridge so now how did I begin reverse

87
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,449
engineering

88
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:03,450
well first of all I looked up most of

89
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:05,760
what I could find about the system I did

90
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,440
not care at the time if the information

91
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,409
well-situated was try to look for

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,719
everything that I could and at the time

93
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:16,409
I had a basic which is the listing with

94
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:21,300
which just like just which resistors we

95
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:24,539
use but none of their purposes and then

96
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,389
a bit of emulation code for memory packs

97
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,779
that we're in emulators that was pretty

98
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:35,909
much all that I could find at the time

99
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:43,070
and how this thing with Super NES is

100
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:46,260
really like in 2010 debugging was a mess

101
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,320
they were really limited to pretty much

102
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,830
just racing and quick points and that

103
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,830
was about it

104
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,360
there were there was also like a

105
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,839
disassembler but it was only a toss

106
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,320
application so I had to corrupt some

107
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:09,779
emulator for it but most of my work

108
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,599
most of what I did was tracing tracing

109
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:18,449
and lots of patience to figure out what

110
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:22,409
is even happening so to give you an idea

111
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:24,240
of what I - I decided to take to talk

112
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:27,300
about the first thing I pretty much

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,479
reverse engineered which was the memory

114
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,930
back because it has the most information

115
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:36,240
at least at the time and basically what

116
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,639
it is is just flash memory storage it

117
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,699
was 8 megabits which which is 1

118
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,979
megabytes you do the calculation they

119
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,500
were apparently four types of them and

120
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:51,539
it requires a rig compatible cartridge

121
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:56,669
which is the PSX or any any other games

122
00:06:51,539 --> 00:07:00,120
that used it like an RPG maker so we go

123
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:02,030
a little bit technical on how it on how

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,430
I try to figure out where

125
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,530
if there is was like anything to figure

126
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,710
out and it mentions something about

127
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:13,789
vendor information and you Cruden a bit

128
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:16,849
by reading some some by use into the

129
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:20,090
memory and then you've identified out

130
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:23,570
like there was like MP so I assumed like

131
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,640
it was about some kind of ID and then

132
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,630
there was another another value in there

133
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:32,530
which was which was pretty much

134
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:39,020
something like did we know much about

135
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:43,549
and this thing says when a so to figure

136
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:46,390
out that that stuff I was rather lazy at

137
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:51,650
the time so I did a run hack instead I

138
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:54,380
did figure out where the bsx cartridge

139
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,700
loaded this information and I replaced

140
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:01,480
it with just hard coded value instead

141
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:05,750
which is explained here

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:10,340
and then I fired out like the game that

143
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:12,710
I had loaded name later was loading like

144
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,780
four times for some reason there was a

145
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,530
list of four times the same game and

146
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:22,489
then I figured out like with some trade

147
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:27,289
motivating and stuff I forgot like when

148
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:29,660
I change one a to one see it was reading

149
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,240
four times the amount the amount of the

150
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,540
memory which meant that instead of eight

151
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,549
megabytes it was 32 megabytes so that

152
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,049
was that installation vehicle is not

153
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,049
something that ever came out

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,620
but just by doing this I kind of figure

155
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,800
out that most of the reverse engineering

156
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:58,200
technique I use I figured out on pretty

157
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:01,390
much my own I use it is assembler for

158
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,450
just to get to the code that I want

159
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,870
without necessarily going to trace trace

160
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,450
logs which I did use it then to figure

161
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,839
out the flow and the flow of the code

162
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:17,050
and then I did lots of blind were making

163
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,010
which is probably not the best thing to

164
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,740
do because then you don't necessarily

165
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:28,290
understand what would have happened

166
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:34,240
sometimes sometimes when I do that stuff

167
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:37,300
nothing really is noticeable but it's

168
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:42,130
always much faster to get an idea of

169
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:46,719
what I'm doing and hopefully gets into

170
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:52,420
more detail later and then I figured out

171
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:55,540
like most of the some of the BS techs

172
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,709
save data I will explain vsx a little

173
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:02,339
bit later how to download content and

174
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:07,959
how to use the memory back batting with

175
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:11,310
e-reading erasing and that's all that I

176
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:15,489
have kept like logs of what I did before

177
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:17,949
like in forum post and especially video

178
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,120
logs where I've shown my progress

179
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,279
throughout all these ribbons engineering

180
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,560
so you can still find all of them like

181
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,560
on YouTube on my channel

182
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:39,339
and then in the middle of all that I

183
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:44,080
stopped everything because something

184
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:47,990
happened and that was no cash as in yes

185
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:51,620
this simulator is made by Martin cough

186
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:55,220
aka no cash and this person is also

187
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,760
known for making a huge amount of

188
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,760
documentation

189
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,040
and also just being really good at

190
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,739
reverse engineering and this

191
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,719
documentation came up came with full

192
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:13,660
documentation of downloaded content it

193
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,490
also came with like full documentation

194
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:20,770
of the beer of the PSX and how he had a

195
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,650
screeching engine and everything so

196
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:26,980
basically messed up pretty much stopped

197
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:31,030
right there and then it was just all

198
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,350
about using that work and hopefully get

199
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:41,699
somewhere with it

200
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:46,550
so that's basically how I did most of

201
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:50,130
what most of what I figured out

202
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:54,240
throughout the whole thing but now let's

203
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:58,040
talk about like the actual thing of

204
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,410
pretty much everything we know EFT

205
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,390
so first of all I would like to talk

206
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,969
about the BSF Scot which because it's

207
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,830
the thing that pretty much was the base

208
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,920
of all reverse engineering because it

209
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,050
was pretty much a BIOS ROM for using

210
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,900
this attribute the satellaview

211
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:21,300
hardware it is pretty it is pretty

212
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,030
complicated sometimes because this

213
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,089
coverage is unique because it uses it

214
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:35,699
uses a very unique hyper mapper that is

215
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:37,830
only used for this and basically it has

216
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,590
a memory back slot and then a matter

217
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:43,080
that maps the BIOS from the place run

218
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,720
the SRAM and then there's something else

219
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,320
that we found out that according to a

220
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,050
penton's

221
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,920
it was internal flash memory but it was

222
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:56,609
removed so that was pretty interesting

223
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,370
and then the chip that passed that

224
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,390
manage all this is called the memory the

225
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,660
memory map controller and security chip

226
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,880
which

227
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,780
Taine's American stroller and the seed

228
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,710
ship that makes the cut which work on

229
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:17,730
the Super Nintendo or Super Famicom in

230
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:22,920
this case so let's explain what the BIOS

231
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:25,680
run is about so the BIOS ROM light it

232
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,709
has whole most of the basic functions to

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,760
use the satellite view and memory pack

234
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:35,220
it also came with a bike : gene which is

235
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,970
used for most of the interface but also

236
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,430
some medicines that came out there's

237
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,480
also like some kind of operating system

238
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,479
with a trading system

239
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:52,560
and also obviously the menu and also

240
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:54,480
fonts that games also used but the most

241
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,219
interesting thing about the functions of

242
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,500
the BIOS ROM is that you can and did

243
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:05,010
update them there's a jump table in the

244
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,790
restaurant where most of the functions

245
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:15,090
from the PSX got BIOS ROM have code from

246
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:17,339
there is all there is a lot of jumps in

247
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,130
jumps that part where you could just

248
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,560
pretty much replace the jump jump to

249
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:26,220
another part of its families contain the

250
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,449
updated code I did jump back to the bsx

251
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:35,160
run whenever that's necessary it also

252
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:37,880
has many saves engaged safe which some

253
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,400
of some of the parts of the SRAM has

254
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,290
proper checksum checks to make sure it

255
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:50,270
fits in corrupted or not

256
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:54,120
and basically the bsx is like a whole

257
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:57,360
like RPG like menu

258
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,240
which is so neat and oh really try to

259
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,740
make this as friendly as possible but

260
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,059
also a little bit charming

261
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,670
it looks like hot bummed but it's not

262
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,860
actually developed by any there is

263
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,559
actually no real stuff in common between

264
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:21,389
this between these two which is

265
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:25,649
interesting and the thing with like bsx

266
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:28,589
is that there are also a lot of NPCs you

267
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:34,439
could set up you could set up also this

268
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:37,730
season there is also like a fountain in

269
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:40,110
the center of the town where pretty much

270
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,920
where you could change it to pretty much

271
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:48,569
in almost anything and there is also a

272
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:54,860
building that you can change to whatever

273
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:57,569
you want so basically the PSX use pretty

274
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,610
download service that pretty much all

275
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:03,349
the time some of them are shot in

276
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,790
updates and some of them long-term like

277
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,360
like for certain

278
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,748
you pretty much download spread like

279
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,029
constantly every move all the time and

280
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:18,329
this this data is pretty much like a

281
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:20,370
status ID which basically means if it

282
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:23,219
changes that means the data is different

283
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:27,179
now so it replaces the data with the

284
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,100
news there is also a directory ID which

285
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,860
I will explain later

286
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,220
there is also audio setup where you

287
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:39,059
could set up pretty much if you want to

288
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:47,269
enable sound effects music

289
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:51,449
or the or the radio or not and then the

290
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:55,139
there's also a bunch of NPCs you can

291
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:57,748
enable with like the maximum of five

292
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:02,279
with some exceptions and then a list of

293
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:05,789
available via DS which which is pretty

294
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:08,189
much like when something can be

295
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:12,749
downloaded it's available on this on

296
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:16,019
this service data then the first thing

297
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:19,350
they downloads it's pretty much a

298
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:24,359
welcome message where as soon as you

299
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:27,118
connect as soon as you start up the town

300
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:31,008
you see a message I mean could be pretty

301
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:35,009
much anything that we want to write and

302
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:37,710
then in terms of long term there is the

303
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:40,799
directory which contains an ID which

304
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,710
went is which is which if it does not

305
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,850
correspond to the town status then then

306
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:51,029
it will update in contains the folders

307
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,059
which contained file files all items

308
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,690
because since the menu is pretty much an

309
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,299
RPG

310
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,480
you can also buy items that are mostly

311
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,369
useless and then there is also expansion

312
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,110
data which contains the event Plaza

313
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:06,240
which is the bird which is the building

314
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,189
that change that you can just you pretty

315
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:14,279
much anything you can bring in pallets

316
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:17,570
graphics also and also like where is the

317
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:22,350
tool in building and you can also bring

318
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:25,408
Justin by code for custom NPCs and then

319
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,949
there is a patch system where you just

320
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:34,460
print the address and data that's how it

321
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:37,259
updates the BIOS on the rest from

322
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,169
folders are pretty much like every

323
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:44,059
building and NPCs yet you can find which

324
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:47,039
means that you can you can also change

325
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:49,820
you can make them as sharp shop for

326
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,810
items you can also make them something

327
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:59,850
NPC that gets

328
00:18:51,810 --> 00:19:01,860
to download a game or other content so

329
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,620
and you can also make them say pretty

330
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,590
much anything you want

331
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:11,459
since the folder contains a name and

332
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:13,050
also a description which is actually

333
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:19,260
like the first thing that you see when

334
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:24,659
you talk to them or or opportunity when

335
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:28,800
you go go to the building and then now

336
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:31,500
let's talk about cetera view so that's

337
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,879
that was pretty much the basics of what

338
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:41,010
ESX does but now let's talk about like

339
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:44,460
how it actually downloads stuff so the

340
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,560
side view is pretty simple on the

341
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,560
outside you can you can see that there

342
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,120
is a PS import which contains the bit

343
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:56,429
stream of everything it downloads it

344
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:00,810
plugs to the extension ports for this

345
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,940
per Famicom and and you can also notice

346
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,490
there is that there is also an extension

347
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,460
pot on the Saturday view which is a

348
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:11,700
first time IDE thoughts kind of thing

349
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:15,300
and where you can use it for a hard

350
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,700
drive or or maybe make an adapter for

351
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:22,200
compact flash which is what someone else

352
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:28,010
did and what's inside is pretty much a

353
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,010
PCM decoder for the audio for the radio

354
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,120
something called the SPR BSA which is

355
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,690
just an in from which contained the

356
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,719
serial number of such a review then the

357
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:43,920
main drain of it all is the data channel

358
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:49,350
decoder which is not just doing what it

359
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:51,960
says its way it means so to first to

360
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:55,439
explain what the data channel decoder

361
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,910
can do we have to talk about what's in

362
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,910
the satellite

363
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,260
well what what's in the bitstream is

364
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:10,770
pretty much like a constant a constant

365
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:13,800
frame frame up the frame of that

366
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:18,660
contains PCM audio channels which can be

367
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:23,879
like up to four of them so you can do

368
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:27,960
like up to two stereo tracks of audio

369
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,400
and then there is a data channel which

370
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,060
is con which contains pretty much

371
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,060
everything else including the gains and

372
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:40,500
VSS service data there is also error

373
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:43,860
correction for everything and that's the

374
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:51,930
part that we don't and not everything

375
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:59,159
that we entirely understand yet first of

376
00:21:51,930 --> 00:22:02,130
all before it gets to the data channel

377
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:06,660
decoder it goes to the MN a eight nine

378
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:09,240
two two one which goes pretty much like

379
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,230
this it described all the data during

380
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,770
the leaves and then it manages the audio

381
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,770
for itself

382
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:19,680
and then sends the data to a data

383
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,910
Channel decoder so then you can do way

384
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,910
when it needs to do

385
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:31,680
so the detection a decoder is not just

386
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,480
decoder is pretty much how you

387
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,590
communicate to the satellite view all

388
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:41,220
the time the test destiny decoder first

389
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:43,730
of all this is what it is supposed to do

390
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,710
with the data but it can also do some

391
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:51,180
management which pretty much spoilers on

392
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:54,780
the decoder the PCM decoder and the

393
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:58,020
alias and the LED there is a general

394
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:02,550
purpose input output which is mostly

395
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:07,280
used for the extension pot as well as

396
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:09,899
well as muting the pci module if need be

397
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,190
there is also a SATA interface to access

398
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,570
the EEPROM and the PCM decoder and then

399
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:21,870
it also brings a custom address

400
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:25,530
interface for the extension bonds so the

401
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:30,889
data channel so I have to explain what

402
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:33,330
it contains basically one packet

403
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,429
contains all of these things it contains

404
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:40,350
a prefix which contains the logical

405
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:45,750
channel which basically is pretty much

406
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:47,969
an ID for the data whether the packet is

407
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:51,080
the first

408
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,630
or the last odd none of these or both

409
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:58,500
because obviously you can just put every

410
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:01,650
data in 22 bytes so you have so it's

411
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,090
pretty much a chain of packets and then

412
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,180
there is a continuity index which is

413
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:09,480
mostly used to make sure there's nothing

414
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,610
missing in between and then also an

415
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,150
additional error correction for

416
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,149
everything

417
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:21,520
then there is the datastream register

418
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:26,110
sets so that's what this printer can

419
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,110
access and that's what the bsx use there

420
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:35,020
is a logical channel selector which

421
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:39,580
basically adds like a way to select to

422
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:41,650
make sure what data we need there is a

423
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,659
prefix hunter which basically is about

424
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:47,530
like the amount of packets that in the

425
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:51,580
buffer a prefix first in first first out

426
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:57,668
where you get the prefix data also a

427
00:24:51,580 --> 00:25:00,939
data before the data and also an or gate

428
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:04,990
which is used every time you read the

429
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,179
prefix the prefix it actually all the

430
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,270
data into another register so you can

431
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:14,380
just check that resistor for every

432
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:17,410
packet that you're about to get and you

433
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,250
can easily figure out if there's an

434
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,250
error or not

435
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:27,090
so here's pretty much how the data

436
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:33,130
channel decoder works the data channel

437
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:36,580
goes to a messia I compare so if the if

438
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:40,000
this is what you select is the color so

439
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,530
if the data channel packet goes goes to

440
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,809
the decision Airport decoder

441
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:49,360
it only gets you only takes captures so

442
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:53,049
to speak the packet that we want with

443
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,530
the right LCI then it performs checks

444
00:25:53,049 --> 00:26:00,429
with some checksums and continuity

445
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:04,720
checks and then it puts everything into

446
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:08,710
the prefix person first out and the data

447
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:12,940
and then after that everything is pretty

448
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,919
much handled by by the by DBS expires or

449
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,160
any other cartridge that best support

450
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,160
this

451
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,040
for technical parts personally I don't

452
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,669
want people to use the real hardware

453
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,430
except laughs for documentation or

454
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:34,770
possibly other special cases that maybe

455
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:38,370
we hear about in the future so what did

456
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:42,379
I learn out of this so first of all or

457
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:44,969
when I reverse engineer this review I

458
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,450
learned pretty much low level system

459
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:52,500
knowledge of this I learned how to how

460
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:55,980
to run hack properly also learned like a

461
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,980
bit of art with knowledge so when I

462
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:02,280
looked at hardware I can get a basic

463
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:06,480
idea of what I'm looking for and how to

464
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,340
document stuff everything I learned from

465
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,090
this I tell you was used to figure out

466
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,090
the 64dd

467
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:17,879
so that's pretty much the end of this

468
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,039
talk

469
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:27,158
lot of people who worked on such a group

470
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:30,789
reservation and documentation and and a

471
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:33,190
lot are still being discovered today so

472
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:35,619
I really would like to thank Davey

473
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:40,409
pockets like in the last few years

474
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:44,230
tooth for helping figure out how the

475
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:46,749
satellite data actually is and maybe

476
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,970
we'll be able to use the actual sensor

477
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:52,869
data to figure out how it works and then

478
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:56,970
maybe provide like cropper experiences

479
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:58,520
that internet on a relation

480
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:18,470
so that's pretty much it for this talk

481
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:24,389
thank you for listening that I made like

482
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:26,730
mid like in 30 minutes I thought it was

483
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:41,100
going to be shorter for a second and

484
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:43,110
then longer but we have our next panel

485
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,000
coming up so if anybody has any

486
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,330
questions for the wee people or wants to

487
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,780
talk please go to the air-gap

488
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:55,049
discord and you see stream Q&A channel

489
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,879
if you want to ask any questions or talk

490
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:59,190
given how much sure however much time

491
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,220
luigi but actually has but yet that's

492
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,750
what we're talking about stuff so and

493
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,570
yeah we don't have a discord but we're

494
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:10,860
not that fancy here here's the here's a

495
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:13,649
