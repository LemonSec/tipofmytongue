1
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,440
music sitting in a room so um what what

2
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,270
Alvin Lucier says there at the opening

3
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,030
is the piece of music it's a process

4
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,650
piece it's called so his voice feeds

5
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,280
back through the tape recorder and goes

6
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,638
back out into a speaker and by the end

7
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,229
of the piece it's about 45 minutes long

8
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,060
you end up with the resonant

9
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:57,510
characteristics of the room so usually

10
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,040
an scholars don't skip through the 45

11
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,870
minutes you know you listen to it and

12
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,190
it's quite an incredible listen and it's

13
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,729
very much active listening but I've

14
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,430
prepared a spectrogram run for about 25

15
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,099
minutes through where you can see the

16
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,880
room resonance is starting to appear you

17
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,880
should be able to see

18
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,769
[Music]

19
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,459
[Music]

20
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,000
that's what it sounds like towards the

21
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,370
end that speech that you heard at the

22
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,470
beginning after it's just multiplied or

23
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,470
being convulsed with the room acoustics

24
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:53,150
so going back to the idea of reading

25
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:55,909
sound this definition I pulled up it's a

26
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,870
very interesting book about how sound

27
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:03,500
design and sonic clinking has been used

28
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,569
politically to influence and in the

29
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,610
consumer round to influence so many

30
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,470
things so it's something that we need to

31
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,270
get much better at and learn to control

32
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,300
because it's bits but also being

33
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,729
targeted and used in in ways that I

34
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,680
don't completely support but the first

35
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,349
step is that we have to start to listen

36
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,120
to things like that resonant

37
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:27,349
characteristics of the room how am i

38
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,110
doing for time I think we're going to be

39
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:35,750
alright so I wanted to do a live demo of

40
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:43,810
something that it's a music hack that

41
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:47,319
I've written which wraps the free sound

42
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:51,789
API does anybody know what free sound is

43
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:57,440
so it's a project that was initiated in

44
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:59,419
quite early 2003 I might say from the

45
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,529
music technology group in the University

46
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:06,020
of Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona it's a

47
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:07,940
community built archive of field

48
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,909
recordings but they can also be any type

49
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,840
of recordings it's an audio archive so

50
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:18,229
many things they are available under a

51
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,630
free attribution license and the API is

52
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:23,449
really thorough so you can look it up

53
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,580
you can look up sounds in terms of just

54
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,800
tokens or descriptions or keywords but

55
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,318
you can also look things up according to

56
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,060
their spectral content and duration and

57
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,620
volume and stuff like that so I made a

58
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:39,420
little exercise to see if we can do

59
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,490
actually do some of that reading sound

60
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,460
just try to see what it feels like to

61
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,230
push beyond your literal interpretations

62
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,830
of words and what you expect them to

63
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,830
sound like

64
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,149
[Music]

65
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,150
[Music]

66
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,940
seems to be wanting to do the scientists

67
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:17,409
so this is like a news headline story

68
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:20,440
and what we're going to do is use those

69
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,270
tokens to pull out streamed audio from

70
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,020
the free sound database and it will just

71
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,580
compose them in in the written the order

72
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,349
that it's pulled them out but it will

73
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,799
make a sound collage for us and let's

74
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,400
see if see how you feel about the

75
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,400
relationships

76
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,910
that's that one is interesting because

77
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:28,430
they're sometimes gravitational waves in

78
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,649
the article pulls up the actual sound of

79
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,680
the sonification of gravitational waves

80
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:39,470
that was you know a major milestone in

81
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,699
in in physics and it was the result is

82
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,649
so difficult to explain what

83
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:45,500
gravitational waves are to the public

84
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:48,680
that what what they did the scientist

85
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,600
was put out the sound of it so it's

86
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,130
quite a famous sound which I sometimes

87
00:09:50,600 --> 00:10:04,899
it comes up but not this time so going

88
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:07,370
back to the slides I think it's also

89
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,810
important to think about what what I was

90
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,930
saying there that you might think that

91
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,529
I'm listening to sound or this type of

92
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,180
deep listening practice is limited to

93
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:20,420
people who have the you know good

94
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,140
hearing but this quote from Dame Evelyn

95
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,180
Glennie

96
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,250
and she's the first person in history to

97
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,399
successfully create and sustain a full

98
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,579
time career as a solo percussionist

99
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:35,180
incredibly talented musician who's

100
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:38,439
completed that career profoundly deaf

101
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,589
and she now listens in a very

102
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,589
interesting way

103
00:10:54,619 --> 00:11:00,269
that could have been the microphone on

104
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:03,269
my pulse there but it's actually so our

105
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:06,209
room recording so not the acoustics of

106
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,949
the room the acoustics of the womb I'm

107
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,589
just going to share with you now a few

108
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:12,868
of the interesting facts about our

109
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:17,789
relationship to sound to hopefully

110
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:19,919
inspiring you little yes or they ordered

111
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:22,468
to resist them becomes functional around

112
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:26,189
25 weeks and they're in between

113
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:27,719
maternity and when I was looking for a

114
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:29,039
picture with his slide I found that one

115
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,779
and I thought it was quite good because

116
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,439
I was talking about a deep listening

117
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:36,689
practice and I think that could be a

118
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,669
good example of when somebody who might

119
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:40,978
not be comfortable with doing that sort

120
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:43,739
of listening you know tries to begin to

121
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:45,629
relate to the yet unborn child by

122
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:48,509
listening through sounds so we

123
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:52,739
established these relationships very

124
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:55,079
early on and they mean a lot and I think

125
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:57,269
there's a there's more area we're

126
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,098
talking about sound but music as a music

127
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:01,709
space if we talk about music as

128
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:05,639
organized sound there's a lot of really

129
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:09,329
interesting post rave literature about

130
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:13,619
how important that is for the shaping of

131
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:15,269
our imagination and the scope of what we

132
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:18,419
might be able to think about in terms of

133
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:21,989
organizing principles and organizing

134
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:24,779
ourselves this book is highly

135
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:29,220
recommended and it just starts to Adam

136
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:31,169
starts to open up the probability space

137
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,529
and he's calling it infinite but with

138
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:35,909
many multi dimensions reminds me a lot

139
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:37,319
this is how I'm able to keep up with

140
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:40,199
some of the conversations I've had with

141
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:42,478
networked people here and it at born hat

142
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,269
because you know in music we also think

143
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:49,199
about these huge spaces with multiple

144
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:51,599
dimensions of variables infinite

145
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,508
variability as an example let's talk

146
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:57,449
about you know this idea of infinity

147
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:59,129
well anything's possible so Adam quite

148
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:00,359
early in his book starts to postulate

149
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,459
that music without

150
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,040
is something very viable that a composer

151
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,479
composes so when we talk about non sonic

152
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,189
music I'm quite comfortable with that

153
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,720
but a lot of people have a question and

154
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:11,849
say how can you have music without sound

155
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,709
so I thought we could try some exercises

156
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:19,670
on that so let's talk about kind of

157
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,670
imagining sound

158
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,459
this is working even better with the

159
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,560
screen moving I have to say but does do

160
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:42,040
any of you hear a sound when you look at

161
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:46,839
that silent gift what it was so what

162
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:53,290
does it sound like to you well many

163
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:57,280
people report hearing a low sub when the

164
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:00,880
pylon hits the ground there's a there's

165
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,069
a reddit thread full of noisy gifts

166
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,800
where's people who experience this

167
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:10,990
latent synesthetic synesthetic phenomena

168
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,550
they start to post loads more and if you

169
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,960
want to if you're getting something from

170
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,910
that then you might want to explore more

171
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,790
and also Elliott Freeman's research so

172
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,560
he's trying to explore this visually

173
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,660
evoked auditory response which has

174
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,300
become quite prominent because of this

175
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,949
this particular gift by happy toast was

176
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:32,620
the one that went viral but there's

177
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:38,400
loads of other ones the point of that is

178
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:42,280
that the neural plasticity of the brain

179
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,260
has kind of fixed our senses in place

180
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,720
quite early on but what I'm trying to

181
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,540
get at is that our relationship to sound

182
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,270
even for a large amount of people who

183
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,520
can hear that pylon here's some sub

184
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,430
coming out of it you know it's still

185
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,110
something that we can train to get a lot

186
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,209
more information out of it and it's

187
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,510
totally entwined with with the way we

188
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,040
think and the way we perceive things and

189
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,569
it also goes back a really long way so

190
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,449
that what I'm telling you now is not

191
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:13,780
something new that new research has

192
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,060
shown it's starting to say hey before we

193
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,699
were dominantly visual culture we used

194
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:26,170
our auditory sense much more and of

195
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:31,320
course the navigation of cave systems in

196
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:33,370
the dark with very little light and the

197
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,520
archaeologists that go down and study

198
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,990
primitive art have there's a new branch

199
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,520
opening up relatively new called

200
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,290
archaeoacoustics where they try to

201
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,329
assess

202
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,880
the placement of certain cave drawings

203
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,440
and primitive art and they try to assess

204
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,439
it acoustically like why did our

205
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,800
ancestors choose this spot to paint this

206
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,140
and they think about the limited light

207
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,939
they would have had and they go down and

208
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,880
just try to assess the acoustics and

209
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,460
they found a lot of correlations between

210
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,080
very weird phenomena of sound in caves

211
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,620
reflecting off walls and weird

212
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,760
underground echoes to the location of

213
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:19,720
some of the most impacting art they feel

214
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:22,350
that there was a that the sound had a

215
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,070
sort of supernatural quality for our

216
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:31,420
primitive ancestors I've got a video of

217
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:33,780
Igor Resnick off exploring a cave with

218
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,780
his voice

219
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,490
[Music]

220
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,799
[Music]

221
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:11,209
okay that's good so for a long time

222
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,188
sound phenomena has influenced ancient

223
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,500
art and architecture and the way we

224
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,140
think it's only in recent years and the

225
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,930
rise of screen culture and then digital

226
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,209
visual culture that we sound has

227
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:26,449
seemingly taken some type of backseat

228
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,610
into him some type of entertainment or

229
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,070
like a good playlist for coding too or

230
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,929
like it's very secondary was I still

231
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:39,770
think that we can get a lot smarter with

232
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:44,990
it so just some more examples from that

233
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:48,530
I've collected to share with you so

234
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,820
these are the the Aboriginal song lines

235
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,980
you might have heard of them a Bruce

236
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,950
Chatwin he wrote a quite a famous novel

237
00:17:51,980 --> 00:18:00,050
at the end of the 80s which documented

238
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:06,040
this concept but the the aboriginal

239
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:09,440
cultures have this like G of psychic

240
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:12,260
supernatural environmental song

241
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,970
tradition that maps out man's

242
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:21,110
relationship to the spirits and the

243
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:25,010
locations in the environment and this

244
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:28,159
sort of sound and story starts to give

245
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:31,480
you hopefully some ideas about how sound

246
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,810
and sound forms and music can encode

247
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:40,640
some really complex information that can

248
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:44,899
be decoded by sharing with the next

249
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,260
generation by singing a song and so on I

250
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:51,410
wanted to play this as an example of a

251
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,330
kind of sound story that it's quite

252
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,950
personal for me so I told you at the

253
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,949
start that I had started out a little

254
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:01,010
bit in the amiga demo scene making mods

255
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:05,270
that would fit onto the the boot blocks

256
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:09,020
of the floppy disks and and at that time

257
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:12,170
it was 88-89 and we were trading through

258
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,450
through the post in jiffy bags and disks

259
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:17,120
would arrive one day this disc came with

260
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,770
this four channel thing of numbers going

261
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,360
up and is called a tracker and it's the

262
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,820
first time I saw a sequencer and it was

263
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,689
written by the hacker community for them

264
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:29,030
to be able to make mods right so um I

265
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,910
got really into it and made lots and

266
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:37,240
lots of music for my group that group

267
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:37,240
that I was in and at some point I had

268
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:45,050
recorded a sampled my mum coming in and

269
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,270
I said we were I was making a track I

270
00:19:45,050 --> 00:20:03,740
said mum shout punch it down the mic now

271
00:19:49,270 --> 00:20:05,810
she said I've got it yeah and that's

272
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,830
really weird because I pulled this this

273
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:11,270
is a mega demo scene archive that's been

274
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,710
organized by people I don't know around

275
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,970
the world that appeared I just came

276
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,410
across it about a year and a half ago

277
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,320
and they had a bunch of these mods that

278
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,450
I had made in my bedroom in 1988-89 on

279
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,149
floppy disks and they are merging their

280
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,870
fully attributed from people who are

281
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,600
documenting a subculture through a music

282
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,719
tradition that's really tied with a also

283
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,139
the roots of compression technology and

284
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,790
lots of things so for me personally I'm

285
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,160
still I'm still can't figure out how

286
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:44,659
they got from the floppy disk to that

287
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,340
Archive in 2018 but I played it to my

288
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,580
mum you know and she said when did I say

289
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,560
that

290
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:53,330
in 1989 interesting so what I'm getting

291
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,820
at here with that personal story and

292
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:59,949
something that's more culturally an

293
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:02,840
anthropological is specified is that um

294
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,420
again that sound this is a big subject

295
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,899
so I've put that on one slide in a nice

296
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,520
layout but it's it's the same sort of

297
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,230
thing that we talk about here and it's

298
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,850
about encoding information sharing

299
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:18,220
information bringing communities

300
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:21,409
together evading control evading being

301
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,440
manipulated you know unlike music plays

302
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,350
a huge

303
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,840
huge role in that and sound as of as an

304
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:35,159
energy form and a data transmission form

305
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:40,409
can be used in many ways the think

306
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,820
before you think paradigm again I'm

307
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,150
going back to it because it's like how

308
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,409
can we begin to how can you who maybe

309
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,210
who haven't practiced deep listening

310
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,860
maybe as much as I have for all you know

311
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,370
as associated with music as much as I

312
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,290
have how can you start to get at those

313
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,939
ideas and it's really just about doing

314
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,740
some listening practice so here is a

315
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,050
great place when you're camping and

316
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,700
there's some sound systems that are

317
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:05,159
distributed around the place and over

318
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,510
here you might hear something and then

319
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,400
the sound of the trees and then they

320
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,470
start to blend together so you need to

321
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,690
just sit I find if I close my eyes and

322
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,300
just sometimes put just cut my hands

323
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,040
over their ears and you can just sit and

324
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,540
breathe and just listen for five minutes

325
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,149
do that every day and you're gonna

326
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,520
you're going to start to perceive nuance

327
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,420
in a way that mint might resonate with

328
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,420
with your other work

329
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,549

[Music]

333
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,930
[Applause]

334
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:24,100
so now going to this idea of music which

335
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,100
is the probably the most common

336
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,959
association that people have with sound

337
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,260
and apart from language of course spoken

338
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,260
language

339
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,000
whenever we

340
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:51,178
we changed we are no longer the same

341
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:54,209
after having very little certain sounds

342
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:59,340
and this is the mole of the case when we

343
00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:02,090
hear organized sounds organized another

344
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,090
human being

345
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:12,339
[Music]

346
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:40,839
[Music]

347
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,370
right so the point is this piece of

348
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:51,389
music so that Stockhausen it's a

349
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,850
composer modernist composer very very

350
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,010
very intelligent bloke incredible vision

351
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:59,340
of the future and of other worlds and

352
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:03,590
his music is astounding and impressive

353
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:09,510
to to explore I did that version there

354
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:11,939
some time ago because I thought about

355
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,850
how he just had over he how could he

356
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,560
have seen that sound and music or it

357
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,439
might not be organized by another human

358
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,240
being anymore right so that's what that

359
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,290
whole sound piece is meant to written I

360
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,150
don't know if you've been listening to a

361
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,399
I produced music on a sample by sample

362
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:29,490
basis but you know sound is now being

363
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,140
organized by a not by human beings

364
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,880
anymore we're hearing new types of

365
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,860
sounds I've also been thinking about

366
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,620
this idea that music changes you on a

367
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:49,800
cellular level and I've been thinking

368
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:54,810
about that song the Dec own so it made

369
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:59,659
me want to drink beer I've got another

370
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:59,659
example here about how efficient

371
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:11,909
organized sound can be and they pump

372
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:14,699
death to second track very famous so now

373
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:16,440
I've got to a point in my practice where

374
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,940
the some of the things I'm telling you

375
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,530
I'm only dipping into it but I hope that

376
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,350
you're trying to you're getting an

377
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,629
impression that I believe pretty

378
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,490
strongly that everything that I've

379
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,760
learned in a lifetime working with sound

380
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,560
in order to be practice can start to be

381
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,480
put to better use than just I'm going to

382
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,909
make cool beat I'm going to do a good

383
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,280
track whatever so I'm starting to look

384
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:43,500
at ways that I can give a much more

385
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:45,240
meaningful result from my work I've got

386
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,820
a couple of examples to show you where

387
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:53,700
that might be this is a local one from

388
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:55,600
Finn from Auden see so there's a device

389
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:02,770
embedded in a cup

390
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:05,860
and it has various recordings of at

391
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:09,280
least Hansen's daughter reminding her to

392
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,110
drink she suffers from dementia and it

393
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,910
forgets to drink and has terrible time

394
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:16,000
going to bed completely dehydrated so

395
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,530
this this simple touch of order to

396
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,110
redesign thinking instead of putting

397
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,000
letting an engineer approach that

398
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,459
problem by just putting a beep in the

399
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,170
cup you know they actually put

400
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,630
recordings of someone who's very

401
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,940
familiar that she trusts so a sound that

402
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,740
she's familiar and trusting with and

403
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,790
that's a really good start that kind of

404
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,490
story and here's one that I wanted to

405
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:42,760
bring here to - born hack I haven't done

406
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:48,600
anything with this protocol yet but I

407
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,600
think it's really promising it's called

408
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,200
chirp I all

409
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:58,990
now the chirp guys sent me this I've

410
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,060
been following the project since 2012

411
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,790
and I asked them if they had a slide

412
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,510
that could explain it for me and it's

413
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,889
like this it's basically a frictionless

414
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:11,110
data - it's like a cute they they say

415
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,750
like a QR code in sound so you can

416
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:16,990
transmit data to any nearby local

417
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:19,240
devices is completely for me it's just

418
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,820
saying right this is a technology that's

419
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,380
decentralized this ad hoc that can

420
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,899
network that could communicate data

421
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:30,970
through sound it's really robust I did

422
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:34,080
have some of some of it chirps so yeah

423
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:36,940
this is the payload is really small

424
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,010
something like 32 bytes and the

425
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:43,390
transmission time is relatively slow for

426
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,830
a data network like five seconds could

427
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,160
be three seconds but it can also be

428
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,360
those tones can be working in the you

429
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,830
know what they can be inaudible in the

430
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,139
higher frequency ranges they can be

431
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:56,679
multi-channel and they can be

432
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:58,990
transmitted just from any device that

433
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,180
can hear that tongue to another device

434
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,160
that can descend it and vice versa

435
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:07,120
I'm really interesting protocol so if

436
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,870
you're interested in approaching this

437
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,510
topic

438
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:13,780
from a really specific technical

439
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,900
sonification exercise this one would be

440
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:19,420
great there they've got their

441
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:23,650
development kit an SDK up there on chirp

442
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,660
IO and this is a the agency that I've

443
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:30,010
established the startup I'm establishing

444
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:32,620
this year in Copenhagen and we are going

445
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,990
to start trying to bring like

446
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,000
facilitated workshop based learning to

447
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,860
get people to open up and listen and

448
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,620
start to hear for nuance and listen for

449
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,919
nuance before piling into okay now we're

450
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,750
going to change your environment and

451
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,059
tune it and things like this first we

452
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:52,780
want to have some type of life centered

453
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:57,129
goals and impact oriented design you

454
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:59,500
know so I'm starting to explore a lot

455
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,360
more of these direction for music and

456
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,910
sound

457
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,830
there's contact details and we are

458
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:09,150
totally open that's well put that little

459
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:14,530
did you see it drop us a line because

460
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:15,910
I'm also interested to see what ideas I

461
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,379
came here also to have lots of

462
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,510
conversations I've had so many amazing

463
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,960
conversations and inspiring things that

464
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:24,879
I hadn't thought about from from the the

465
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,890
lighting system that's here on the poles

466
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,929
what's it called the special message

467
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,640
coming out of it and and how that was a

468
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:34,210
visual version of something that could

469
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,380
also have been done with auditory you

470
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,090
know and it could have been pretty it's

471
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,220
kind of happening already with the camps

472
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,199
and the sound systems but if it could

473
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,480
have been integrated into the the lights

474
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,970
and all sorts of stuff so you know also

475
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,700
I was thinking about ways to and enhance

476
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,040
productivity and a deep dive for when

477
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,679
you're working with some really critical

478
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,420
coding situations and you need to have

479
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,270
special concentration I mean you know

480
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,740
it's quite primitive to have this

481
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,139
headphones and white noise and noise

482
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,030
cancelling stuff that and these sound of

483
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,950
surf and all this stuff that seems to be

484
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,700
quite popular at the moment is really

485
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,860
primitive as far as I'm concerned for

486
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,960
the possibilities of designing sound and

487
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,560
that's basically the talk so thank you

488
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,490
so much for listening

489
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:31,510
[Applause]

490
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:40,790
questions any questions some ideas and

491
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:43,100
brainstorms requests yeah and you had

492
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:46,309
that one recording of the sound of that

493
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,290
bird they have basically two layers of

494
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:51,190
sounds in there was it both from the

495
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:54,940
bird or was it some background noise or

496
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:58,580
actually that's it that's a whole LP of

497
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:02,360
first-class recordings it's a very very

498
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:06,909
good example of it of field recording

499
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:10,129
and I think that particular soundscape

500
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,960
it's not it's not edited afterwards it's

501
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:15,380
like that's what it sounds like to be in

502
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:19,990
the place where John Walsh who was the

503
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:22,790
recordist he would have to take

504
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,380
mission-critical audio technologies so

505
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,540
that's already something that is here if

506
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,950
you camping here okay you can you know

507
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,530
cook and stuff like that but you've got

508
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,169
to try and find those types of sound

509
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,240
scapes but that's as they are and I

510
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:37,250
think to go out there and be in a field

511
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,990
recordist and bring that back so I can

512
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,820
play it here for everybody and you think

513
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,890
oh it's layered maybe it's been

514
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,799
processed or something like that that's

515
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,240
already blowing your mind so it's not no

516
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,080
that's what it sounds like not only the

517
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,730
implications went of the particular

518
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,189
sound of this particular bird singing a

519
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,980
death song you know it blows my mind

520
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:05,350
that nature can be so good at organizing

521
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:05,350
a sound question

522
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,299
so thank you for your talk I haven't

523
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:14,799
actually been but I've heard that

524
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,869
Helsinki is like one of the cities in

525
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,408
Europe that has done a lot out of sound

526
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:22,119
design like it's it seems to be well

527
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:24,970
known for for having done a lot about

528
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:27,879
this but other cities are not following

529
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,399
up keeping up with with this trend like

530
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:33,158
what do you think is needed so that we

531
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,139
will get create more awareness about how

532
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,659
important sound is for our well-being

533
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:39,850
and reducing stress and such things in

534
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:43,330
cities I said it's a good question

535
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:50,199
because the soundscape of the cities is

536
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:52,570
something that we make and you would

537
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,779
need to start to get as thorough and

538
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:58,779
rigorous as John horse going out to find

539
00:33:55,779 --> 00:34:00,519
that particular part of the Venezuelan

540
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,919
jungle and those birds you know like how

541
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,899
can we do this in the city to to try to

542
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,690
capture the way that the sits sound of

543
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:09,969
the city changes around us what

544
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,490
information can we get from listening to

545
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:15,790
the sound of cities from 20 years ago to

546
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:19,000
how are they sound now so that's

547
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:21,699
something that is absolutely really

548
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,918
important to document Anthropocene

549
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:28,569
impact on the soundscape yeah if there

550
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:31,810
are no further questions this terrific

551
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:35,040
run of applause for question

552
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,040
[Applause]
