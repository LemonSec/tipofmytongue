1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,110
[Applause]

2
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,670
all right please welcome our next

3
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,650
speaker Amelia andersdotter we will talk

4
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,650
about adventures in hard westernization

5
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:04,660
[Applause]

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,729
yeah so I'm back and today I have slides

7
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,030
so for everyone who likes pictures

8
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,979
that's a very good that's very good news

9
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,500
this is a table of contents which

10
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,240
doesn't actually list the first three

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,820
slides because I ended up having

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,940
formatting problems I'll be talking

13
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,880
about some good news from Hardware

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,340
standardization where companies are

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,679
trying to address real privacy problems

16
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,110
that we have had in Wireless local area

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,900
networks in particular and then I'll be

18
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,060
talking about some bad news which is

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,190
that other companies are trying to make

20
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,860
real tangible privacy and security

21
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,330
improvements in mobile networks but

22
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,229
they're not allowed to continue those

23
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,870
endeavors from their political masters

24
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,179
I'll also be trying to cover some ideas

25
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,970
about what we can do as a community to

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,250
ensure that good developments get the

27
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,679
policy support that they need and the

28
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:04,030
bad developments get the type of counter

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,680
pushes that they deserve but first I

30
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,510
wanted to talk a bit about the

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,869
organization that has enabled me to be

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,560
here today to talk about this topic

33
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,290
article 19

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,230
it's a uk-based freedom of speech

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,900
organization that has for five years

36
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,660
been running a program on human rights

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,750
and technical standards so the work of

38
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,640
article 19 starts from this idea of

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,310
which is really formulated by Krantz

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,200
burg in the 1980s that technology might

41
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,549
be neither good or bad but it's also not

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,829
neutral so if technologies aren't

43
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,450
neutral that means from the perspective

44
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,680
of human rights the technical design

45
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,630
also matters we tried to introduce

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,670
diversity into the technical design

47
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,890
process and a focus on Human Rights

48
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,350
values and what they mean for engineers

49
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,418
and how engineers can reflect upon human

50
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,590
rights when they are making the next

51
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:00,129
generation of

52
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,900
products that say we've been doing work

53
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,819
in a range of organization over these

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,510
years we started out that the internet

55
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:09,129
Engineering Task Force IETF and I can

56
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,079
which of course deals with the DNS

57
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,298
system back in 2014

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,180
since then the activities have been

59
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:19,510
expanded into the Institute of the

60
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,090
electric and electronical engineers the

61
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,500
3gpp which does mobile network standards

62
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,269
and also the International

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,180
Telecommunications Union which is a

64
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:30,220
United Nations body that roughly they're

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,819
responsible for land area codes and

66
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,650
telephone numbers we've been working on

67
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,540
developing human rights considerations

68
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,959
that are meant to assist the technical

69
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,328
design process in the IETF we have RFC

70
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
80 to 80 which codifies human rights

71
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:47,620
considerations for protocol developers

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
and in the I Triple E we have these

73
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,030
previously recommendations which are

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,010
still in a draft form but they've been

75
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,840
making big advancements in the last two

76
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,540
years and we're hoping that at least in

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,450
the next year a couple of years they

78
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,220
might make it into a final kind of

79
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,899
standards format where they can be

80
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,980
actually applied and referred to as an

81
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,480
authoritative I Triple E document when I

82
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,130
want to give some words of caution about

83
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,250
considerations and technical design

84
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,168
process processes one of them is that

85
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,060
standards are not mandatory all

86
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,370
standards that are made are voluntary

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,639
for private sector parties to apply or

88
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,310
not developing the standards in spite of

89
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,120
this limitation takes time money and

90
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,680
commitment in many cases technical

91
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,870
standards are simply written by those

92
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,820
who show up so those that have the money

93
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,070
to have a lot of Engineers to attend

94
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,460
standards bodies and make proposals and

95
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,110
research what barriers different aspects

96
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,099
and developments need to be inserted to

97
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,740
make next generation technologies but

98
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,690
then there is a final kind of challenge

99
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,220
of working with standards is that even

100
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,599
if you have the most perfect standard

101
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,310
ever written and then it takes into

102
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,610
account all of the human rights and

103
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,720
privacy considerations you could imagine

104
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,280
the fact is your standards is not

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,110
impactful if it's not implemented so the

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,570
article 19 we try to have this holistic

107
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,250
approach where it's

108
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,190
that if the technology is not designed

109
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,510
to respect human rights probably human

110
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,540
rights will not be respected by

111
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,550
deploying the technology but also only

112
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,890
having the design in place is not enough

113
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,710
you need to have this holistic approach

114
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:29,310
to the entire process of the product

115
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,930
from design to market that sounds like

116
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm a marketing consultant consultant

117
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:38,130
but bear with me yeah so my work for the

118
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,599
past two years with article 19 has been

119
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,940
mostly oriented towards hardware

120
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,580
standards that means I have worked a lot

121
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,250
in I Tripoli 802 with the standard that

122
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,530
is formally called Wireless local area

123
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,330
networks but in practice most of us

124
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,299
encounter it in our day-to-day lives as

125
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,030
Wi-Fi so Wi-Fi is actually a brand it's

126
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,440
maintained by the Wi-Fi Alliance which

127
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,809
is a separate organization from the

128
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,880
after plate I Triple E 802 but I think

129
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,330
for conceptual purposes it's fine if to

130
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,270
think of I Triple E 802 11 as Wi-Fi

131
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,030
standards body for the past seven months

132
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,140
or so I have also been following 3gpp

133
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,330
which is the third generation

134
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,669
partnership project it's like this big

135
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,840
global organization of mobile network

136
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,790
equipment manufacturers

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,130
telecommunications operators and a few

138
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,350
others including governments as we will

139
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,930
see and they make mobile network

140
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,540
standards they were originally formed to

141
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,490
develop the 3g standard which or you

142
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,560
know UMTS these kind of things that were

143
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,500
deployed way back when now they also

144
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,970
deal with 4G and 5g but they didn't

145
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,940
update the name and so that's why it

146
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:46,410
sound kind of a anachronistic but

147
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,290
without we can move on to the good news

148
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,150
slides I'll try not to speak too long

149
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,460
there is actually been a number of good

150
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,080
developments in the I Triple E 802 group

151
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,080
from the time that I've monitored them

152
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,460
in 2017 one of them is the dot eleven

153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,810
eight you previously enhancements

154
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,539
amendments which deals with some

155
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,790
geolocation or tracking issues that have

156
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,220
been raised by researchers and privacy

157
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,790
technologies for the past six or seven

158
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,700
years it introduces MAC address pre

159
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,680
Association randomization so basically

160
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,849
when you're not what it says is that

161
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,290
your mobile phone or connected equipment

162
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,240
should randomized it's layer two

163
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,620
identifier

164
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,460
as long as you're not associated to the

165
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:31,220
network it also fixes some other things

166
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,849
like asks the chip and the management

167
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,740
frame not to probe for specific SSIDs

168
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:40,340
reset sequence number counters to ensure

169
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,569
that you can't track the equipment by

170
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,590
ancillary attacks that have been

171
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,289
described in literature

172
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,940
I mean basically it does a lot of the

173
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,068
privacy enhancements amendments and dot

174
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,699
11 aq which was already passed last year

175
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,130
in June introduces a lot of fixes the

176
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,550
problems that have been raised

177
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:00,050
persistently by researchers since 2013

178
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,030
this is a very positive development

179
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,039
we now have a standard which describes

180
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,799
how we could mitigate a lot of the

181
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,539
serious privacy concerns that previously

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
have been kind of built in to the

183
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:14,539
technical architecture of our devices

184
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,400
I've included on this slide a link to a

185
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,949
presentation made by one of my

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,489
colleagues at 802 dot 11 which explains

187
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,319
the general dot 11 AQ canny features in

188
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,849
a more comprehensive format I realize

189
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,380
you may not be able to copy it from the

190
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:28,820
screen but if you contact me afterwards

191
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,439
I'll send you the link and I'm sure

192
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,569
you'll find it all very interesting so

193
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,310
other things that are going on with

194
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,370
Wireless local area networks which are

195
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,779
interesting is scalable geolocation this

196
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,909
again comes into the tracking

197
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,339
requirements but it's a very well

198
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,680
studied problem and literature so it's

199
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,329
very for me heartening to see that

200
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,550
privacy enhancing technologies research

201
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,199
is now being actually adopted by

202
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,420
industry and their practical processes

203
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,430
one of them is passive ranging or

204
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,550
passive geo locations basically making

205
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,099
the identity or location of a device in

206
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,199
a network function kind of similarly to

207
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,850
GPS so instead of the network figuring

208
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,529
out where you are the network provides

209
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,550
you with information to help you find

210
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:17,660
yourself we had recently on the spring

211
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,399
some advancements to modify management

212
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,560
frames in such a way that it will be

213
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,250
easier for an end user device to

214
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,630
indicate policy preferences this is also

215
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,730
something that's been addressed in

216
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,959
literature I know especially at INRIA in

217
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,730
France

218
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,430
and I was very happy to see this being

219
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,200
taken up by the group in in May although

220
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,969
a word of caution

221
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,310
is that it's not yet in the actual

222
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,560
standards yes the proposal the amendment

223
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,689
is not adopted

224
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,579
of course when your market standards is

225
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,990
such a low level you also need to take

226
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,030
into account that there's a difference

227
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,660
between a mechanism for expressing a

228
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,579
policy and the policy as such so you can

229
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,920
have an indication in a management frame

230
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,870
that you have a specific policy

231
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,880
preference but the I Triple E 8:02

232
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,940
normally does not set for instance

233
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,270
defaults default values or what should

234
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,310
be how should this bit be set when it

235
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,870
shipped to consumers so I will return to

236
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,969
this and the third section of this talk

237
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,490
because the fact that they define the

238
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,520
mechanisms but the actual defaults are

239
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,990
then left to other processes makes a big

240
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,060
difference especially in the European

241
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:28,580
regulatory framework so on to the bad

242
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,650
news I will actually go back to a

243
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,590
presentation made by a Nokia Belle ABS

244
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,930
engineer last year at the Etsy security

245
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,400
week it's an annual event organized by

246
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,560
the European technical standards

247
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,560
Institute which was formed in the 1980s

248
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,599
and has some form of statutory base it's

249
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,250
free to attend for anyone who can afford

250
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,220
to go to the south of France for a week

251
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,960
and chill out

252
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,940
but this presentation I was there last

253
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,650
year I saw this being presented live and

254
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,480
it really alerted me to something being

255
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,390
extremely wrong in mobile network

256
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,220
standards organization so Nokia Bell

257
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,970
Labs many of you will know was a really

258
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,250
big company right Nokia is not a small

259
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,780
institutional actor also Bell Labs I

260
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,670
would not call one of these you know

261
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,740
small and medium-sized enterprises that

262
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,569
do not have any market leverage so what

263
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,990
she appears to be describing here is

264
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,420
that there are some reality of attacks

265
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,820
against mobile networks which include

266
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:30,349
intelligence communities military and

267
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,060
law enforcement and they're stopping our

268
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,860
companies from developing but their

269
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,750
privacy and security mechanisms by

270
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,760
showing up at the standards meetings and

271
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,650
objecting to features that would

272
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,530
otherwise protect us from being

273
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,720
introduced now actually we have

274
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,520
documented evidence now from brussels

275
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,380
institutions that this is not just at

276
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,120
the 3gpp that these law enforcement

277
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,130
institutions show up

278
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,480
well so the I should say also that the

279
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,360
other significant thing about this

280
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,460
though Nokia Belle abs being a big

281
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,130
company if they are objecting to this

282
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,050
then we know if we like privacy and

283
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,390
security that we have some strong allies

284
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,280
which aren't just this is not just an

285
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,560
idealist ik interest these industries

286
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,880
are trying to make security improvements

287
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,010
but they are finding themselves

288
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,720
challenged by the powers that be and

289
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,430
they're also challenged at the Council

290
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,530
of Ministers so this is the report that

291
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,800
came from I think Europe all and euro

292
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:28,220
just in May of 2019 where they are

293
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,709
trying to take the endeavors of industry

294
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,570
to improve privacy and security all the

295
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,580
way up to the council of ministers of

296
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,620
the European Union because they are

297
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,190
finding industry endeavors to improve

298
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,590
privacy and security bad and they wanted

299
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,500
to be politically stopped because merely

300
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,030
exercise saying resistance against such

301
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,730
improvements in the standards

302
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:52,699
organisations apparently was not good

303
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:55,550
enough for them and so this is quite

304
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,400
serious psyche Bazaar is struggle really

305
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,640
between European values and member state

306
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,290
values it's as if our companies have

307
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,600
been told by the data protection

308
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,490
regulation for instance that you need to

309
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,260
protect personal data and you need to

310
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,760
have better data security or we will

311
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,950
give you a four percent fine of your

312
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,710
annual turnover for not doing your due

313
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,060
diligence on the one hand but then on

314
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,770
the other hand you get these weird

315
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,540
political conflicts where public

316
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,130
authorities make angry documents with

317
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,620
politicians saying that our life is

318
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,360
destroyed and terrorism will haven't

319
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,860
happen if in every corner if these

320
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,430
companies actually act on this

321
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,680
legislative imperative that we gave them

322
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,959
I interpret this to be a conflict

323
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,609
between the slightly idealistic consumer

324
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,840
trade in economics environment to

325
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,340
Brussels pulling in one direction

326
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,470
various member states with more sinister

327
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,930
and national security and interests are

328
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,360
pulling in another direction and our

329
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,189
companies they're sort of stuck in

330
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,150
between they're getting pushed in both

331
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,460
directions at the same time there are

332
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,140
some weird consequences of this one of

333
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,180
them is that end-to-end encryption is

334
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,680
being blocked not just by conservative

335
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,569
companies which can

336
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,430
sometimes be reluctant to make changes

337
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,279
in their architecture but it's also

338
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,469
blocked by telcos who will frequently in

339
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,029
3gpp meetings raise objections like we

340
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,740
cannot do that for lawful intercept

341
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:17,720
reasons we cannot do this we cannot do

342
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,810
the other security improvement because

343
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,399
if telcos do not say that governments

344
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,500
can revoke their licenses and they can

345
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,170
no longer operate on the market for many

346
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,240
telcos that means real investment losses

347
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,829
of billions of euros so they simply

348
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,940
can't afford to stand up to the

349
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,860
government's in these cases there's also

350
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,770
some weird consequences of lawful

351
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,330
intercept working group at 3gpp actively

352
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:45,170
pushing companies to develop data

353
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:47,000
maximization business models so that's a

354
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,189
direct contradiction with European law

355
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,110
actually because data minimization is

356
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,580
one of the core principles of European

357
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,649
data protection law and one of the

358
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,089
things which if you do not implement you

359
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:02,360
can have a four percent annual turnover

360
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:05,029
fine I found this so this second point I

361
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,770
should mention is also I only know of

362
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,830
this point because I was in a meeting

363
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,270
where this was said so to my best of

364
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,370
knowledge this isn't written down

365
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,380
anywhere but it was a fascinating

366
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,029
exchange between you know law

367
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,880
enforcement going maybe you can tie to

368
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:24,709
maximise an industry saying oh it's not

369
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:27,260
really foreseen there's a third problem

370
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:29,119
which is that government authorities who

371
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,459
participate in the 3gpp standards

372
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,020
framework put forward proposals of

373
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:38,660
really dubious legal of legal dubious

374
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,579
legality so one of the really good

375
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,630
examples of this is a real-time access

376
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:47,630
standard at CTS 102 six five seven which

377
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,150
enables police forces to go in real time

378
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,040
in a telecommunications operator network

379
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,699
and access customer data without the

380
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,949
telco knowing it was developed in 1997

381
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,690
when in most European countries that

382
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,370
kind of real-time access to data would

383
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,959
not have been legal for law enforcement

384
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:08,540
to do and I know at least in the Swedish

385
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,399
context we had huge discussions in 2012

386
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,279
about whether this technology should be

387
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,160
legalized because it exists so it's

388
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,390
almost as if sometimes these government

389
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,240
authorities the participe

390
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,310
in 3gpp are using the platform as a

391
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,710
reverse policy washing platform

392
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,300
they create the technical requirement

393
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,070
which isn't lawful in order to be able

394
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,579
to go to legislators and ask them to

395
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,110
make the bad technology lawful industry

396
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,600
of course is put in a terrible position

397
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,050
because of this I propose it's not

398
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,730
useful yeah because they can't really

399
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,979
object because they risk losing a lot of

400
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,650
investments so they try to make all of

401
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,380
these diplomatic assertions like oh it's

402
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,720
not foreseen this is not great

403
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,550
one big Mobile Equipment vendor last

404
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,010
year released a security strategy in

405
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,839
December where they committed to making

406
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,550
end-to-end encryption available for

407
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,190
Internet of Things devices because

408
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,540
actually how else to secure them but

409
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,820
they specifically do not make that

410
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,010
commitment for n for end consumer

411
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,629
communications and I believe it's

412
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,150
exactly because they've been put under

413
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,209
pressure not to not to advance such

414
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,070
ideas but it also ironically means then

415
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,900
that in their security strategy for the

416
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,810
entire world and billions of people and

417
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,339
devices this mobile equipment vendor is

418
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,109
saying that they prioritize my

419
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:28,550
toothbrush more than they prioritize me

420
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,649
this is not a good thing this is not a

421
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,139
good principle upon which society should

422
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,000
be built and it's a terrible position

423
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,190
actually for mobile network equipment

424
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,450
vendors and operators they are trying to

425
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,850
do the right thing they're just getting

426
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:45,380
blocked from doing the right thing but

427
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,719
enough about the problems in the world

428
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,620
actually we'll come back to them at the

429
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,470
later slide just kidding yeah I wanted

430
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,679
to talk a bit about like optimistic

431
00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:03,830
views on if we have good standards how

432
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:06,740
do we get them deployed and so I was

433
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,750
following for some time when working in

434
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,850
Brussels website accessibility standards

435
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,650
which some of you if you work with web

436
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,219
front-end web development you'll know

437
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,470
about wcag 2.0 which is a web

438
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,810
accessibility standard it was developed

439
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,940
like ages ago it's been around for 20

440
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,129
years and so it could have been deployed

441
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,440
by any public sector institution in the

442
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,669
European Union for all the time but in

443
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,829
practice it hardly ever was

444
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:34,679
so when instead happened was that the

445
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:36,989
European Commission launched a proposal

446
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,679
for a directive to mandate public sector

447
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:43,889
institutions to have accessible websites

448
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,479
it was passed in 2015 or 2016 and then

449
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,758
in order to implement the directive

450
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:49,739
there needed to be a European harmonized

451
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,829
standard they call it which is developed

452
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:54,649
by a team so now the European

453
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,789
institutions are in the process of

454
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,408
assisting and the development of this

455
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:00,690
harmonized standard which will

456
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:03,419
eventually enable European public sector

457
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,739
institutions to follow WCAG web

458
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,419
accessibility standards

459
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:08,519
I think this is a long and fairly

460
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,169
tedious process which to me is not the

461
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,639
best effective way for the European

462
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:14,609
institutions to make use of good

463
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:18,689
industry developments so I want to

464
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:20,579
propose some other ways in relation

465
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,009
actually to the wireless local area

466
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:26,279
network privacy improvements that I

467
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:29,129
talked about earlier so three different

468
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,079
options really for ensuring that we can

469
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:33,539
make the most use of industry actors

470
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,309
doing not terrible things one of them is

471
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,539
the radio equipment directive some of

472
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:38,219
you will know about it because you've

473
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:42,059
been working with the Free Software

474
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:44,549
Foundation Europe on dynamic frequency

475
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,320
selection but there's other parts of the

476
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:50,789
radio equipment directive - such as

477
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,320
article 3 3e privacy requirements you

478
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,209
should be able to find it by googling

479
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,418
for radio equipment directive and then

480
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:59,789
locating article 3 3e so that would

481
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,309
basically be an at-sea like process of

482
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,408
being able to benefit from I Triple E

483
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,639
developments because you need to go

484
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,229
through the entire process of a

485
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,998
harmonized standard and I've just told

486
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:11,099
you that a website accessibility that in

487
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,839
Burke very well so that's why I also

488
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,029
have some other ideas about how we can

489
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,339
ensure that there is deployment of some

490
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,259
of these privacy features the first is

491
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,690
the data protection regulation articles

492
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,329
40 or 42 because they deal with codes of

493
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,679
conduct or certification in this case we

494
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,499
would need to support our data

495
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,249
protection regulatory bodies so doctor

496
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:33,749
Tilson attend Denmark or Kiel and France

497
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:35,039
the darkness shoots I forget what

498
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:37,259
they're called in Germany and so forth

499
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,658
to interact with some of the industry

500
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,249
institutions like Wi-Fi Alliance that

501
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:44,100
actually sat down certification

502
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:45,750
requirements for Wi-Fi equipment

503
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,070
this might be able to take the form of a

504
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,440
code of conduct or a certification

505
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,230
program but I'm pretty sure that if we

506
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,470
can get if these previously enhancing

507
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,420
features were to be considered data

508
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,460
protection by design for instance that

509
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,170
would be a strong incentive on industry

510
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,020
to actually implement these features

511
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,180
which are already standardized we can

512
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,520
also support public procurements there's

513
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,460
the Wi-Fi for EU programme which hands

514
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,800
out money to municipalities so you could

515
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,660
try to assist either the European

516
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,879
Commission or municipalities that are

517
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,950
trying to access this money in putting

518
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,660
the right requirements and equipment so

519
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,610
that they request features which are

520
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,120
already under standard from the vendors

521
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,340
that sell it I think both of the two

522
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,409
latter points like either the gdpr or

523
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,090
public procurements is a quicker way of

524
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,370
me showing that we can benefit from

525
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,500
privacy standards then the radio

526
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,760
equipment directive would be but either

527
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,640
of these three methods would be

528
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,350
perfectly fine the only challenge for

529
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,600
somebody who does not regularly work

530
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,550
with regulatory authorities would be

531
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,100
that it can be a bit messy to realize

532
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,409
exactly how you get stuff moving in the

533
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,149
implementation of law interacting with

534
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,440
parliamentarians is easier because you

535
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,690
just send them an email and then it's

536
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,820
their problem regulatory authorities

537
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,240
might request you to have technical

538
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,679
knowledge or write reports and you know

539
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,450
they also have larger requirements on

540
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:11,190
their work in the 3gpp and mobile

541
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,900
networks I think it's more a challenge

542
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,510
of how do we ensure that European values

543
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,070
prevail because as I described there's

544
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,340
the struggle between the Member States

545
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,560
and the European values and so how can

546
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,290
you counterbalance that it's much more

547
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,669
tricky because national security

548
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,530
interests normally worked really

549
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,110
long-term it's like this real-time

550
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:35,100
access standard which they pass in 97

551
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,840
only to make legislative proposals 15

552
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,850
years later

553
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,159
so whatever countering strategy you have

554
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,020
for these public authorities that bully

555
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,120
companies into not developing privacy

556
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,139
and security it needs to probably be

557
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,070
like long term one of the methods that I

558
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,300
could spontaneously think of is again

559
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,419
ensuring that there's counterbalancing

560
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,629
representation in the 3gpp so NGOs can

561
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,940
do

562
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,799
like article 19 is doing of course it

563
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,309
requires a lot of resources money and

564
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,799
time

565
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:07,440
3gpp is full of big companies so they

566
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,429
organize meetings all the time one could

567
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,860
spend one could not even be in enough

568
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,620
meetings to cover the 3gpp as one person

569
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,350
one would need at least three and so

570
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,449
that's a challenge for NGOs another

571
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,159
method of doing it is getting public

572
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,480
authorities to start monitoring and

573
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,770
counterbalancing other public

574
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,780
authorities like data protection

575
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,080
authorities have a real interest

576
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,129
I believe in monitoring the 3gpp

577
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,678
especially since we appear to be having

578
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,049
public authorities actively encouraging

579
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,210
or even forcing companies to reflect on

580
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,100
business models that technically are not

581
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,159
in line with what the European law

582
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,809
prescribes here again that's mostly a

583
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,370
question of being able to boost the

584
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,200
self-confidence of data protection

585
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,449
authorities which in many European

586
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,210
countries are full of lawyers lot of

587
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,150
technical persons so there's a kind of

588
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,640
knowledge gap to be divided to be

589
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,610
bridged in this case that knowledge

590
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,080
divide where more people who work with

591
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,120
the enforcement of privacy norms

592
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,889
especially the European ones need to

593
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,649
have the self confidence that they can

594
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,900
actually usefully defend them also at

595
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,039
the technical standards layers these are

596
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,780
some of the things that I've been

597
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,720
working with article 19 to develop

598
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,539
systematic approaches to but if one is

599
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,000
interested in working on this as well or

600
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,590
if you can provide technical feedback on

601
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,590
the information that we're trying to

602
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,970
compile please be please feel free to

603
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:34,908
reach out to me and I can send you some

604
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:37,110
documents over email and we can talk I

605
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:39,140
think that's the last one on my science

606
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:44,370
actually because I forgot to make the

607
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:45,600
final slide but those were in the things

608
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,830
that I wanted to propose and I want to

609
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,480
thank you all for your attention and

610
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,090
time and if you have any other questions

611
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,600
you can speak with me after or even ask

612
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,600
questions now

613
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:04,299
[Applause]

614
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,299
we do have time for questions

615
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,810
I'm just thinking that the system of

616
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,150
having standardization that is not like

617
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,250
you don't need to follow it it's just

618
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:21,440
bound to fail in some ways because

619
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,660
what's the reason for a company choosing

620
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,130
to follow a standard the standard is

621
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:33,890
yeah because what do they have to lose

622
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:35,690
if they don't follow it well so in

623
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,360
Sweden for instance there is recently a

624
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:41,200
proposal just at the end of May in 2019

625
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,790
that the licenses which allow electronic

626
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,280
communications operators to to even be

627
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,659
companies and provide services would be

628
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,940
subjected to the scrutiny of

629
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,930
intelligence services and the security

630
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,840
services so I think the data protection

631
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,580
authorities in general do not have the

632
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,860
competence to block companies from

633
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:04,520
participating on a market but law

634
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,870
enforcement and security services do so

635
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,750
the companies have really strong

636
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,280
incentives to follow the requirements of

637
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,460
law of law enforcement and the

638
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,740
disrespect I have an idea like a

639
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,850
different kind of system because instead

640
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,640
of like punishing companies in some way

641
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,870
of not following like the idea

642
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,390
idealistic behavior and the problem

643
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,040
about that is that a somebody needs to

644
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,610
find out that they're not following this

645
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,800
as a behavior so they can just like a

646
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,469
black box and they can just hide their

647
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,540
behavior behind the facade of the

648
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,760
company right so if you make the

649
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,940
opposite make it the opposite way so you

650
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,410
actually get support from the state like

651
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,140
you get monetary support or something

652
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,820
like that from being as you can prove

653
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,740
yourself that you have a good behavior

654
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,149
so you make a good proof and every every

655
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,520
time we can make this proof that they

656
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,830
have some good behavior then you would

657
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,330
have everybody would like run towards

658
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,000
like oh yeah I can prove I'm the best

659
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:08,870
and then you don't need to get this body

660
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,700
that comes in and finds that the bad

661
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:15,020
behavior all signed they can work like

662
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,610
you can inverse the direction of it so I

663
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,170
think like the general data protection

664
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,389
regulation contains some of these

665
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,960
mechanisms codes of conducts and certain

666
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,850
occasions are really technically a part

667
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,650
of the European legislature trying to

668
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,439
say listen there are ways that you can

669
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,720
actively demonstrate compliance and ways

670
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,260
that we will accept so the legislature

671
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,660
tries but then the question is can the

672
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,520
can the regulatory bodies like the DPS

673
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,920
also effectively work with these tools

674
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,960
and I think at this particular time in

675
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,160
Europe there's been no approved code of

676
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,750
conduct under the GDP are the financial

677
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,610
mechanism that would encourage companies

678
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,850
to sign up to or create the code of

679
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,530
conduct is a bit dubious so the economic

680
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,169
model for the companies isn't really

681
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,899
there in the legislation updating the

682
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:09,320
GDP are with in the near future I will

683
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:10,910
not consider probably feasible and also

684
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,950
it is more likely actually to do damage

685
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,100
than to do good if you look at the e

686
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,600
privacy regulation and all of the member

687
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,610
states and companies that are now trying

688
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,110
to get special exceptions for themselves

689
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,969
but so there are some of those

690
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,939
mechanisms that you could work with by

691
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,320
supporting implementing bodies so rather

692
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,660
than making it a political discussion

693
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,340
you try to discuss with you know data

694
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,380
protection authorities about how do we

695
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,360
make the code of conduct codes of

696
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,080
conduct work for us can we make

697
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,129
certifications work in a good way or

698
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,040
alternatively you could support public

699
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,530
procurements so when a municipality is

700
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,840
trying to set up a public Wi-Fi network

701
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:49,879
that translates into the municipality

702
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,770
wanting to give somebody money right so

703
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,080
that's kind of a reward can you make

704
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:58,610
that reward contingent on the supplier

705
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,409
fulfilling some criteria which are

706
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:04,250
standardized and possible and

707
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,780
implementable by industry actors and in

708
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,910
that case how do you reach out to the

709
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,530
municipalities to tell them what the

710
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,090
good security standards are I mean for

711
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,010
Wi-Fi networks in particular there's a

712
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,409
bunch of things that you could that

713
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,600
municipalities normally do not do that

714
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,520
they could using the captive portal

715
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,020
standard from the IETF rather than

716
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,780
trying to man in the middle attack their

717
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,100
users for instance but I think in a lot

718
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,840
of the cases when they make these

719
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,280
procurements they're just not aware of

720
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,720
the technical tools that are out there

721
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,500
so they don't know what requirements to

722
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,260
put and on the European laws not in all

723
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,900
Member States

724
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:39,480
some significant number of member states

725
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,910
there's also this ridiculous issue that

726
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,670
they can't make in the procurement

727
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,920
requirements they can only refer to kind

728
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:51,450
of formally adopted harmonized standards

729
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,580
from Etsy not industry standards so one

730
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,350
could also try to work with public

731
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,490
sector institutions to see if there is a

732
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,699
way that they could benefit from

733
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,170
industry industry results rather than

734
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,330
just waiting for the European Commission

735
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,010
to issue mandates under the radio

736
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,439
equipment directive or whatever because

737
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,810
that's just really time consuming and

738
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,700
also not very cost-efficient so those

739
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,669
are the thing those are the venues that

740
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,990
I see for none of them are fairly easy

741
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,040
but they're the intuitive venues that I

742
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:22,020
see for getting for having this reward

743
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,110
system and having some benefit from the

744
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,980
privacy developments in standards bodies

745
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:31,560
3gpp is just completely different

746
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:32,700
because it's because they're it's

747
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,710
actually about like a posting

748
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,350
punishments yeah and so law enforcement

749
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,240
is the more credible stick is

750
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,620
essentially the problem so you need to

751
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,270
make somebody else the more credible

752
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,639
stick because I don't think otherwise

753
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,260
you ordeal with this fact that member

754
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,720
states are not actually contributing to

755
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,590
the European legislative the

756
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,810
implementation of the European

757
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,699
legislative framework it's really

758
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,889
catastrophic even if you were not a

759
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,330
privacy friendly person or you may

760
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,790
rights friendly person I would assume

761
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,610
that you consider this a big problem

762
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:06,230
because you cannot have a company stuck

763
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,229
in the middle of opposing

764
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:12,120
opposing political directions there's

765
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,040
one thing that industry really doesn't

766
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,439
like it's normally being tugged in

767
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:21,090
opposite directions they want stability

768
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,800
and foreseeability I of course will

769
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,070
prefer if they ended up to the right of

770
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,710
my slides with data protection and the

771
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,570
European Union but another way to get

772
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,040
foreseeability for industry is to simply

773
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,510
go in the other direction and say we'll

774
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,770
do whatever the member states say and

775
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,660
whatever is required for national

776
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:41,360
security and that's a more like a macro

777
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,360
political conflict I guess

778
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:53,649
do we have any more questions no then

779
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,948
let's give a big applause

780
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,949
[Applause]
