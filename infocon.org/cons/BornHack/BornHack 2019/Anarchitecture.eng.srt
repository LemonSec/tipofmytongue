1
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,628
test test

2
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,629
sound test check

3
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,060
hello

4
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,729
hello

5
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,340
one last

6
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:52,960
so start I think

7
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:56,710
hey here's Rasmus Jensen yeah thank you

8
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,580
for coming to this talk so this is going

9
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,890
to be about an architecture and just a

10
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,650
quick introduction so this is my name I

11
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:09,070
did a master's in computer science from

12
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,169
the outback university in 2006 and I've

13
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,940
been working on this secure scuttlebutt

14
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:17,620
project for the last two three years and

15
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,810
it's a bit of a fair warning this is

16
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,700
going to be a bit opinionated this talk

17
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:27,060
so there's going to be both technical

18
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:30,849
things and also like there's a more of a

19
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,230
more of a different kind as well but

20
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,919
don't worry they're going to be plenty

21
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:38,260
of technical things as well and so I

22
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,030
wanted to start out with a quote but

23
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,039
instead I wanted to show this pitch in

24
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,320
instead I guess it sort of sums up

25
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,320
pretty well what's going on

26
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:19,539
yeah so this is a pretty clever little

27
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,389
figure so when I'm going to speak about

28
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:25,479
more clearly here's application

29
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:28,629
architecture and software and I'm going

30
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,889
to divide it into three key points so

31
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:32,110
one of them is the infrastructure

32
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,419
meaning that computer that actually runs

33
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,300
all this stuff and the other thing is

34
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,860
going to be the data that's going to be

35
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,929
sort of part of this in the second is

36
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,399
the view on the data or the use

37
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,370
interface like how can you actually

38
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,290
interact with this data so if you take a

39
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,610
traditional architecture you have

40
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,279
nowadays like some server somewhere

41
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:56,019
connected through the internet to

42
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,390
different kinds of clients of various

43
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,850
kinds and we didn't look at the standard

44
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,709
architecture you have some features like

45
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,019
one of them is that the server can be

46
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:08,760
hacked it can be down or it couldn't be

47
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:11,140
shut down like Google that's a lot and

48
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,029
one of the other things is that this has

49
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,040
really often centralized in these

50
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,050
systems it's stored on the servers and

51
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,620
that's where it lives and you have this

52
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,649
UI tends to be standardized and and the

53
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,660
power the power in the system lies in

54
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,640
deciding how you can actually use the

55
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,550
system when you look at this kind of

56
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,130
system online you often get some kind of

57
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,339
one-size-fits-all use it or moderation

58
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,949
and when you look at it in a more of a

59
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,649
traditional company settings it tends to

60
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:46,349
reflect the existing organizational

61
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:51,040
hierarchies that are in the organization

62
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:53,680
so let's switch a bit to to talk about

63
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,230
machine learning look at how how happy

64
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,550
they all look and this small network but

65
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm actually going to talk a bit about

66
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,399
more about the dark side of machine

67
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,399
learning

68
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:08,950
so back to the first slide so this part

69
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,350
is going to be talking about the data

70
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:17,560
and the use interface like how you

71
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:19,779
connect with this data and when you look

72
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,089
at these machine learning recommendation

73
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,459
systems it's like anywhere where there's

74
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:28,000
large quantities of data like YouTube

75
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:30,399
Netflix Amazon whatever and Facebook of

76
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,760
course and even if you're not one of the

77
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,209
2.3 billion people on Facebook you're

78
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,569
probably still there I mean a lot of the

79
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:44,649
apps running on your Android phone will

80
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,930
connect to Facebook and and will tell it

81
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,510
which apps you log you you're now

82
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,670
opening in this X gives you a pretty

83
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,279
good profile of the person so let's say

84
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,099
you are opening the King James Bible app

85
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:01,390
or the calorie counter or the peeler

86
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:05,260
tracker for that sake get a lot of data

87
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:07,089
here and when you look at the the user

88
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,569
interfaces in these systems you have

89
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:12,520
this personalized feet and and one of

90
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,010
the interesting things is that when you

91
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,720
look at the u3 when you look at YouTube

92
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,500
when the way the YouTube interface

93
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,120
actually works 70% of the view time on

94
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,459
videos are generated from these

95
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,290
recommendations algorithms and you have

96
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:29,109
the self-reinforcing system where you

97
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,180
have the data generates the UI the UI

98
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,839
generates the data and so on you get

99
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:37,900
this like loop which actually tells you

100
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,510
how the system can be used and then

101
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,459
there's this really depends on how you

102
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:47,560
look at the previous light this is from

103
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:50,890
Facebook data science team 2014 where

104
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,349
they look at the data and and they can

105
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,910
sort of say that well love happens

106
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,910
around here right

107
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,439
so when you look at the features of

108
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,110
these kinds of system you give the power

109
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,820
to the data and this means that you give

110
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,420
the power to anyone who can generate or

111
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,880
buy the data and really when you look at

112
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,089
it this is like black boxes which are

113
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,560
like attack vectors for any kind of

114
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,360
people that want to misuse this system

115
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:26,239
really in the same way as we had

116
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:29,150
provides our software back into 90s so

117
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,180
one way of influencing this system is to

118
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:35,060
buy ads and most of these big companies

119
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,250
now have online repositories where you

120
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,719
can actually go in and look at who

121
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:43,610
bought which apps or ads and the people

122
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,470
that they are targeting with the ads

123
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,810
that's at least some kind of

124
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,600
transparency in this but the problem was

125
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,969
that is you can see here that actually

126
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,190
the software is just riddled with both

127
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:02,390
like identical searches returns

128
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:05,600
different results I mean come on one of

129
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,150
the other problems with this is that it

130
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,850
sort of creates this money almost like

131
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:15,470
money laundering system for buyers

132
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,090
meaning that bias is is the sort of

133
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,250
attributes that you have in the system

134
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,130
which is the data that it is trained

135
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,290
upon elect it really hard to see what

136
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,840
kind of biases you haven't these machine

137
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,969
learning systems another one of the

138
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,710
problems is they have this degenerate

139
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,580
feedback loop like you get to filter

140
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,430
bubbles and echo chambers as well inside

141
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,620
these systems which manifests itself and

142
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,810
in the way you use the system because

143
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:46,310
it's recommended you videos for example

144
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:50,359
so you probably all heard about this

145
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:52,969
take a tie a I that was a part on

146
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,580
Twitter which would look at the date and

147
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:59,090
then actually trying to learn it took

148
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:06,710
exactly 24 hours to turn this body into

149
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:08,570
like full-on Nazi but so what I mean not

150
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,360
necessarily all of this this is bad I

151
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,549
mean it is a system and the same way

152
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,730
this is that the system has can also be

153
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:18,619
turned into opportunities so this is a

154
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,839
quote for how Taiwan combats

155
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:24,739
misinformation so one of the interesting

156
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,839
things that that you can see is that the

157
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,369
people that want to target them with

158
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,139
like propaganda campaign and

159
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:32,569
disinformation and actually start

160
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,639
testing these in the wild in order to

161
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:37,459
have the most effective spread of their

162
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,529
viral content and this means that the

163
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,479
Thailand government can actually go and

164
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,579
look at these signals when they start

165
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,529
happening and what's interesting here is

166
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:49,429
that each of these Ministry land has a

167
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:52,519
team which then has like 60 minutes from

168
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:54,350
when a viral post hits to do like an

169
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,350
equally on more convincing narrative

170
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,929
that they post on the same media as the

171
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:03,949
people trying to to break these systems

172
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:07,100
work we have more of a volunteer-based

173
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:10,008
which I like the Athenian Elves so they

174
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,689
also have a lot of Russian trolls that

175
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,269
goes and writes all kinds of

176
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:17,809
misinformation in news articles and

177
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:19,459
various social media and really it's

178
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:22,009
sort of like resistance fighters about a

179
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:24,109
21st century right like they say that we

180
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:26,389
don't want to be the propagandist in

181
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:31,329
Reverse we just you know want to expose

182
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:34,100
the it's a really low-key and

183
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,660
really mean went in mark now and you

184
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,959
look at the Danish election which just

185
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,939
happens and advertisement on TV is

186
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,829
illegal by law from these political

187
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:46,759
parties but advertisement in it's an

188
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:49,008
Internet is not regulated I mean it's

189
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,529
just I mean it's really just ridiculous

190
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:53,629
when you when you think about it like

191
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:55,610
what kind of situation or what kind of

192
00:15:53,629 --> 00:16:00,199
system do we really want to end up with

193
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:02,449
here so when you look at this machine

194
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,849
learned a lot of ethical questions

195
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:07,429
that's quite often than not like a dress

196
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,249
like what values does the trade Algren

197
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:13,639
actually embody like is a study like who

198
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:16,309
determines what these values can be and

199
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,579
and so actually leaves like a whole

200
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:21,740
question just set aside to whoever runs

201
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,878
these algorithms or the engineers that

202
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,879
runs the algorithms

203
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:34,559
so in summary you can use machine learn

204
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:36,419
to individualize and it's sort of like a

205
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,249
propriety of data and algorithm stack

206
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,459
and it's a constant battle for the

207
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:43,039
people that tries to to use this for

208
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:48,118
good as well

209
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:50,039
okay so let's switch again a bit so I'm

210
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:52,470
going to talk about a different kind of

211
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:55,709
architecture and this is a peer-to-peer

212
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,179
architecture and this is where I think

213
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:00,329
it gets a bit more interesting

214
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:03,089
so one of the ways you could do these

215
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:06,388
centralized systems is in a federated

216
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:09,569
system so this is like we've known for

217
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:12,089
email for like ages it's like different

218
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,039
access can run these servers which have

219
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:17,069
different objectives and different kinds

220
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,470
of of ideals and it's also what's used

221
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:24,359
for Samba for Mastodon which is like a

222
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,620
big decentralized system and when you

223
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,549
look at some of the feature and this

224
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:32,189
again you can see that the power is is

225
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,230
then again centralized at the service in

226
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,169
the same way as it was before

227
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:40,289
so in the same way you can have them

228
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:42,149
hacked and down shutdown and it ends up

229
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:45,149
being like a benevolent dictator

230
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:47,489
moderation system and of course compared

231
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:49,768
to like only one system you get more

232
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,289
diversity you get like local governance

233
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:56,009
as well you can start up an instance and

234
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:58,230
do your own kind of governance of this

235
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:00,929
but one of the problems with these kinds

236
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:04,309
of systems is that they have a tendency

237
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:06,629
to to go to what sort of an eventual

238
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:12,570
centralization like you've seen with

239
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:14,519
email and Gmail for example a different

240
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,678
architecture is fully distributed

241
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:22,470
architecture where the computers running

242
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,629
system are also running the

243
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,000
infrastructure as well we've seen

244
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:31,879
different kind of systems using this

245
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,879
like that and skull port for example

246
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,850
and when you look at these architectures

247
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,340
you have the power is at the edges

248
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,929
instead and this means that you have

249
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,300
used to control over the infrastructure

250
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,130
the data that runs on them and the

251
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,990
software that you used to interact with

252
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,290
the data so this means that you get

253
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,680
bottom-up governance instead of

254
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,960
centralized or pseudo centralized and

255
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,170
then there was a really great article by

256
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,050
Inc and switch which talks about local

257
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:06,460
first software and some of the tenants

258
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:08,590
that they look at in these systems is

259
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,590
that they really want systems which a

260
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,570
fast multi device can work offline

261
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,649
we can still provide collaboration

262
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:20,679
between the between the users of it you

263
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,800
want in conductivity and privacy and you

264
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,900
also want user control

265
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,970
so one of these local first systems is

266
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,640
skull apart and this is actually an a

267
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,920
real image of the network so you see the

268
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,570
red part down here's the old guard of

269
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,660
the system people the nodes have been

270
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,240
here the nose and as you go to different

271
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:45,730
colors these are newer nodes in the

272
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:48,700
network and skull but it's a identity

273
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,880
centered system so this means that your

274
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,250
profile it's is what is central in the

275
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,550
system it's not your post for examples

276
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,290
like it is in the forum and I could call

277
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,210
a social network but it really has a lot

278
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,610
of bad connotation so I'm going to call

279
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,430
it a friend Network instead it's really

280
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,100
like there's the there are really no

281
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,500
gatekeepers in the system's all the data

282
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:15,550
stored locally and you get the user

283
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,470
interfaces embodying local values and

284
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,210
the way it works like these identities

285
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,230
is that you have a scuttlebutt feat

286
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:25,660
which is your identity and so these are

287
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:29,770
just messages that you put in and the

288
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,990
first one has a pointer back to to

289
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,300
nothing it has an author field which is

290
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,880
the person who owns this piece and then

291
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,770
have a hash of the message as well and

292
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,810
then you sign the message meaning that

293
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,389
nobody else could produce this message

294
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:46,178
and they get like a long chain of these

295
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:49,720
messages one for each

296
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:52,539
of these feats and this means that you

297
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,779
get nobody can sort of put in a message

298
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:57,279
in between here or look as if it's from

299
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:59,619
this author because all of them are

300
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:04,720
signed with the key that only the author

301
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:07,240
has so this is an event sourcing system

302
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,669
where feats are these mutable change of

303
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,769
messages and has like an ache a limit on

304
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,499
the messages so you can store them

305
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:19,179
locally it has no global lecture

306
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:21,639
consensus so it's not like not like any

307
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:25,419
kind of Bitcoin or or something like

308
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:27,490
that where I feel has this global

309
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:29,499
properties in them and you could do all

310
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,970
of these messages that you saw before

311
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:34,179
you can either do them public or

312
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,100
privately and and the interesting thing

313
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:38,679
is that you could do any kind of message

314
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,149
as a private message so this this would

315
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,100
mean that you could for example when you

316
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:44,080
follow someone you could do that that's

317
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,459
a private message so nobody else can see

318
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,178
that you're following that person for

319
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,549
example or I block them large files are

320
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:54,759
saucers as blobs whose five megabytes

321
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,918
off limit and the really important part

322
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,019
here is that only you store a product

323
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,299
and you are your private key so it's not

324
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:06,549
on any other service anywhere it's only

325
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:08,110
you another interesting thing about the

326
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,840
system is that because you have this

327
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,869
signed and linked messages by has this

328
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,850
means that you have no URL where you can

329
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:17,499
find the stuff everything is location

330
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,570
transparent because the only thing you

331
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:22,119
need to find a message is the hash of it

332
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,809
and then you talk to people and try to

333
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:28,480
get the message you do this by gossiping

334
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:30,759
so one of the ways or lat like like

335
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,769
there's plenty of ways of some of the

336
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,360
things that are working is like local

337
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,429
network it's in local network they would

338
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,758
gossip between them you can have pops

339
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:42,399
which are Internet connected machines

340
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,039
like any other machine which just relays

341
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:47,379
messages between different ones we do

342
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,658
onion hidden services want to run over

343
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:51,369
tor or you could do sneak and it's like

344
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,929
you can actually do your messages put

345
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:56,379
them on a USB stick and hand it to

346
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:58,389
someone that also works and the way it

347
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,110
works with these feeds is this when you

348
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,600
are you

349
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,909
here in the middle and you start

350
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,129
following people like in any kind of

351
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,809
these systems and that means that the

352
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,870
people that you follow are inside this

353
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:13,120
hub one that have one hop away from you

354
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,459
and the way it normally works is that

355
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,830
the clients are set up to have to

356
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,710
download messages from two hops away and

357
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,678
then put them into your local view of

358
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:28,270
the world so this is all the messages

359
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:32,200
that your machine contains and what's

360
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:34,110
interesting is this kind of from a data

361
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,429
perspective is that you can have like

362
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,870
long-running connections from your

363
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:39,669
machine through a different machine and

364
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,889
then you post like I'm interested in

365
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:44,500
these feats and then you could use these

366
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,480
at the epidemic broadcast reach which

367
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,919
are quite efficient in actually pushing

368
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,870
out updates you can actually have

369
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,000
somebody in the network assuming they

370
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,610
are all connected porting messaging just

371
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,010
acts is just spreading out just as the

372
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,780
as the messages post and you could do

373
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:03,610
this because you have this ordered locks

374
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:05,770
identity-based pure messages I'm just

375
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,629
not going to go into very much detail

376
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,510
here but you can also block people

377
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,750
meaning that if you have in the network

378
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,400
here you can see let's say that you have

379
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,140
these friends who connect you in this

380
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,900
person is really annoying so you can

381
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,549
block them so they don't they they are

382
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,470
not in your network where you can

383
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:25,870
increase the hub meaning that that

384
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,970
person's follows you not get unless you

385
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,678
have someone else that can connect to

386
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,870
those people so that actually stops a

387
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:37,150
lot of these attacks then you have on

388
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:39,370
these kind of systems and this means

389
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,230
that it's easier to guard against spam

390
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,449
and harassment because you only pull in

391
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,390
the messages that you're interested the

392
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:49,480
Pops are are also problematic if you

393
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:51,910
follow them but we have PN Box rolling

394
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:56,020
out very soon which is going to make

395
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:58,600
this really a lot better and one of the

396
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:02,220
other interesting things in this system

397
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:05,320
which is not used very much but is that

398
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:09,940
every network here has a caps and the

399
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:13,520
caps is it's sort of like a key meaning

400
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:16,910
that every message composed or

401
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,830
written in this caps exist in one of

402
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,960
these universes and this means that you

403
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,300
can choose the different caps and then

404
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,280
you have everything else working all the

405
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,320
clients everything works but you are in

406
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,750
a different universe in these universes

407
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,669
don't interact with each other at all

408
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,400
and this means that you have the

409
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,380
possibility to actually run like

410
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,690
parallel systems you could do like one

411
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,120
locally for example for a system that

412
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,160
you don't want anyone else to to get

413
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,929
access to and even if you connect with

414
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,970
these ones if you don't know the captain

415
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:51,620
you cannot get the messages or validate

416
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:53,810
them so if we look at the the software

417
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,030
side of this there are different kinds

418
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:59,090
of different implementations so one in

419
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:03,980
JavaScript want to go one on the way in

420
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:06,080
trust and see in Python as well you have

421
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,600
multiple interfaces that can interact

422
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,909
with this data which brings the nice

423
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,860
kind of diversity into the systems we

424
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,020
have like patchwork patty a pattern ooh

425
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,860
you also have mobile Android apps like

426
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,660
many of us for example so it looks like

427
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,689
this it looked like any other kind of

428
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,310
like system where you can see that the

429
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,750
post over here you can see the people

430
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:30,340
you are connected to and you can see

431
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:32,810
some of the people in the system as well

432
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,659
and you can build apps on top of this so

433
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:38,720
for example this is a book app and we

434
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,940
can see you put in and you put in the

435
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,680
books and the way it works it's like

436
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,080
like any kind of an in sorting system so

437
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,420
books are just messages that you post

438
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,780
with a specific type and then you can

439
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,340
edit them in revenue as anyone can do

440
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,379
that and they just do this by actually

441
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,110
posting messages and then you can

442
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,850
correlate them and then actually hydrate

443
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,250
the state of these messages and that

444
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,780
will be your book app and because you

445
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,130
only get data from your friends and

446
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,030
friends of friends slacks it works

447
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,740
pretty well

448
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:14,480
and in general for these apps you can do

449
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:16,820
more local filtering if you want to as

450
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,770
assets these blobs are like normally

451
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,570
with the way we we shall push bigger

452
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,660
data like images for example but it's

453
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,370
also support for that which is super

454
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,080
cool distributed system

455
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,928
as well that you can use for

456
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,428
participation and one of the interesting

457
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,679
things is that you can actually then

458
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:36,230
starting playing around with actually

459
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,910
getting sort of some of the community

460
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,650
things in this like you can have like

461
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,679
these pups which is this long-running

462
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:44,900
note can actually start seeding these

463
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,640
files from your friends and this means

464
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,309
that you actually have a system where it

465
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,039
can exchange data which stays within

466
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:54,440
your network and it actually helps the

467
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:58,129
network it actually grows by the number

468
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,140
of notes that I earn and this is not a

469
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,630
really interesting app that element of

470
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,419
it is called a crystal so the ideas that

471
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,150
you can have a secret that you want to

472
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,549
share words or that you want to say for

473
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,340
example and then you can choose some of

474
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:15,650
the most people that you trust the

475
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,678
secret with and the and the way it works

476
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:21,200
is this mystical sharing so you so then

477
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,270
send it so we then send a shout to each

478
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,700
this person and any choose how many of

479
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,730
these shots that you need what a quorum

480
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,789
of this and this means you can put

481
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:33,799
secrets into the network that that that

482
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:36,650
you can then get back again and these

483
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:39,799
ones can then be from trusted friends

484
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:44,539
that you know for example in the in the

485
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:47,240
real world it can run get on top of SSB

486
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:51,169
like you just really just you get in it

487
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:55,809
at SSB create and then you can see here

488
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:58,340
get like a repository which which has

489
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,559
idea of this and then it actually pushes

490
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,658
these changes as blobs we can have like

491
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,450
the whole system actually running and

492
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:07,429
and you could just pull in updates as

493
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,200
well and it works exactly the same as

494
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:11,720
any other kind of message that we've

495
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,669
seen here and which is the interesting

496
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,710
things was that one of the Linux

497
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,549
Foundation people came into the network

498
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,169
about months ago and wrote this article

499
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:24,080
arguing that the Linux kernel should

500
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:25,549
switch to sort of an SB protocol because

501
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,490
then you'd have the messages in the

502
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:30,650
source code and coexisting let's see

503
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,120
what comes out of this but it's really

504
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,750
interesting to see these kinds of use

505
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:38,610
cases from people

506
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:40,740
so as you can see this like really very

507
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,570
very simple basic building blocks and

508
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,040
you can build all of this kind of stuff

509
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,689
and toughness a lot of these things that

510
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,730
I've shown are just things that people

511
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,590
just build on top of these primitives

512
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:53,570
it's really fascinating see it's almost

513
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:56,459
like a Lego from when you were kids

514
00:29:53,570 --> 00:30:01,020
some of the things that are they worked

515
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,760
on is new message format which is going

516
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,840
to roll out soon which going to be a lot

517
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,450
more efficient has some really

518
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,760
interesting properties private groups as

519
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,400
well so right now we have these private

520
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,190
messages but we also want to have larger

521
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,010
private groups it can be a part of this

522
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:20,010
is not a trivial problem to solve so I

523
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:22,140
want to do this right another thing is

524
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:24,690
like it could be interesting to have

525
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,360
full peer running in browsers like right

526
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,890
now that JavaScript emplaced and runs

527
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,689
the notes and you have these electron

528
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,340
based apps on top of this but it could

529
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,220
be lint interesting to have it like

530
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,530
running this way and another thing is

531
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,060
that it could be one of the things that

532
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,840
have worked on are these safer spaces

533
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:47,460
like abuse audit moderation tools as

534
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,639
well ok so I'm going to do a small demo

535
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,560
here of one of the things that we're

536
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,940
working on and this is this being a

537
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:00,360
browser so this is all of this is

538
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:05,610
running in the browser you can see it

539
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:09,060
uses wesen for the crypto stuff so and

540
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:11,610
then it has you can do plots as well and

541
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:15,899
when you go into this you actually auto

542
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:18,540
generates an ID for you and then just as

543
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:22,530
a small demo I built a system here where

544
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:26,250
you can then actually start and getting

545
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:28,649
the messages so I'm going to do an

546
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,600
initial thing here and I love the

547
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,150
artwork you can see her cycle from ROM

548
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,100
multi community members as well and what

549
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,880
it does now it then it downloads all of

550
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,919
these messages so it actually downloads

551
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,500
from the perspective of my profile the

552
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:47,130
latest 25 messages from

553
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:50,520
and from from the people that I'm

554
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:54,090
connected to and then it then it starts

555
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,040
getting this you can see or 145 feet one

556
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,169
four thousand messages and it does

557
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,270
everything here does it downloads the

558
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,980
messages looks at the private messages

559
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,590
because the way the prod messages works

560
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,100
that there's no recipient on the five

561
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,129
messages

562
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,870
so this means that when you when you get

563
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,420
a private message you actually have to

564
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,610
see if it's if it's for you or not by

565
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,530
actually trying to decrypt it and then

566
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,919
it get these messages into this because

567
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:23,220
I'm only interested in these posts

568
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:25,140
messages and then you have a system why

569
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,280
can you see if this works probably

570
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:32,160
likely to this is really very new so

571
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:36,680
because here we have latest ten messages

572
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,150
and replies and you can go into the

573
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,940
profiles of people and see the messages

574
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:46,260
as well have private messages working as

575
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:49,470
well so and this is there supposed to be

576
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:53,730
messages in here and you can do private

577
00:32:49,470 --> 00:33:00,540
blobs as well and this so so this is

578
00:32:53,730 --> 00:33:04,620
pretty exciting and I think so so to

579
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,930
sort of sum this up this is we call it

580
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,489
if you're latarian software so this

581
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:11,460
means that people actually run the

582
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,500
interest structure themselves it uses on

583
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,940
control of the data and you get these

584
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,040
subjective data views on top of the data

585
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,350
that's set this is not a technical

586
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,200
solution to any kind of social problem

587
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:27,929
do you have out there this is still the

588
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,000
socialist it's really the hardest part

589
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:32,130
of all of this but I mean at least you

590
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,600
have like a level playing fields where

591
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:39,450
people can start experimenting with

592
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,669
different solutions in this way I'm

593
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,160
going to change gear a bit as well so

594
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,780
this is a really fascinating book if you

595
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,600
haven't read it you really owe yourself

596
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:51,660
to read it to read it it's relatively

597
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,949
old book but it's very very good one of

598
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,070
the books that you read and and it

599
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,149
changes the way you think about things

600
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,149
and what it talks about

601
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:03,748
this high modernism which is form of

602
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:06,209
morality which is like like this really

603
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:08,159
unfiltered confidence in science and

604
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,649
technology and what's interesting is

605
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,460
this point here that it reorders to

606
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:19,409
social and natural world for for these

607
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:22,589
things it was very it has the sort of

608
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:24,599
high in the 50s and 60s after the Second

609
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:27,299
World War and it's really characterized

610
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,750
by a lot of centralization even though

611
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:36,059
it doesn't look like it's like it and

612
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:37,469
it's like really rationalization of

613
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:39,659
everything everything has to be

614
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:42,658
rationalized and the problem is that it

615
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:45,089
goes into this kind of so ration that is

616
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,200
all almost like over simplifies things

617
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:51,029
and it has this tendency of of having

618
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,189
like the end justifies the means so you

619
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:56,819
see a lot of these kind of systems used

620
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,640
for example in the Soviet Union and also

621
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:02,940
here it's not necessarily in the I mean

622
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,980
just look at the picture of this Chicago

623
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,779
and people would actually look at the

624
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,190
system saying this is oh this is so

625
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:10,140
beautiful look at all the straight lines

626
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,900
everything is ordered it's really nice

627
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,549
especially from a plane when you're the

628
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,000
planner of this city

629
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:19,829
and then when you look at this old

630
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,210
European cities this is this is really

631
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:23,130
interesting when you look at them you

632
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:26,579
had like these small roads like which on

633
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,380
this road is probably because you want

634
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,720
to move stuff from here to here in a

635
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,520
fast way and not go around this so this

636
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,899
is really an organic system and it's

637
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,700
really interesting when you look at it

638
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,770
this way it actually looks like

639
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:42,118
something from nature not something

640
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:43,619
built and the reason why I bring this up

641
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,589
is that I think we have a lot of this

642
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,049
digital high modernism I mean literally

643
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:51,420
computers are like modernist wet dreams

644
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:53,069
like systems with a really stupid just

645
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,289
follows the rules that you do it's

646
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:57,538
really really great that you can do like

647
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,339
top-down and approach to this because

648
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:02,750
you have these systems that enforces

649
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,750
really simple rules

650
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,339
and you can see it in China for example

651
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,700
with the Soviet credit system but even

652
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:13,190
in the u.s. I mean if you go to more the

653
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:16,669
people that have been analyzing some of

654
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:18,680
the bill posts that they have there and

655
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,990
they actually put in tiny cameras to

656
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,879
analyze your face and look at your

657
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:27,970
agenda and the mood as well and use this

658
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,010
to data mind you so it's not I mean only

659
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:34,640
in these systems and what you end up is

660
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:40,279
this digital panopticon and this image

661
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:42,288
is from a prison actually from 959 1925

662
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:44,450
that they built in the US and what's

663
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:45,859
interesting is that the build is now in

664
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,779
the middle and then you have people

665
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:49,940
looking out and then you have all these

666
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:52,549
cells here which are the prisoners and

667
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,650
what's interesting in this system is

668
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:56,960
that the people in the cells because

669
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,700
they're open then they don't know if

670
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,309
they're watched or not but they know

671
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,919
that they might be watched and alone

672
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:07,819
that fact actually changes the way that

673
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,859
they behave so your end of this with

674
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:12,020
this system of global surveillance like

675
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:13,819
on a state level with the Chinese Social

676
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,460
Credit system for example even with the

677
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:18,020
NSA's as you can see Snowden has been

678
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,150
shown as well but it's very interesting

679
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,529
that it's not only and that's one of the

680
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:26,890
point in the book it's not only in this

681
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:28,789
state-run systems also a lot in the

682
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,558
capitalism as you can see as well

683
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,990
because they are interested because they

684
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,450
want this centralization of the global

685
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:38,890
surveillance so almost all the companies

686
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:41,899
in the Silicon Valley does some kind of

687
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:44,598
thing like this there are ranges of

688
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:47,000
flights in this system so like one of

689
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,099
them is Barcelona which just has some

690
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,079
really really great stuff going on and

691
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:53,539
what's really interesting here is that

692
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,150
they value it is sovereignty like

693
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:58,130
technical sovereignty and the way that

694
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,329
the series is that data is a public

695
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:04,130
infrastructure and more concretely so

696
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:07,579
whatever one honor to be the telecom

697
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:09,640
provider and they said that ok you can

698
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,579
get that contract but then you have to

699
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,799
provide the

700
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:15,959
data after you're done anonymously on

701
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:19,229
this open data portal we have and this

702
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:21,269
means that anyone then afterwards can go

703
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:23,700
in and actually have a level playing

704
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:25,258
field for actually doing the next kind

705
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,029
of system and what's interesting of

706
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:29,489
course is that they resisted for over a

707
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:34,739
year before they actually said okay we

708
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:35,999
can do that so just put this quote up

709
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:39,059
here because it's really cool

710
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:41,669
I mean if and this is like from an early

711
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,219
Chinese menu this one is like several

712
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:49,769
thousand years old but it really shows

713
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:55,859
very well that they knew exactly what

714
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:58,558
was at stake here even back then so some

715
00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:00,569
rice I've shown these different kinds of

716
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:04,890
architecture centralized decentralized

717
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:06,569
and distributed I've shown different

718
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:09,239
kinds of power models in this system

719
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:12,089
hierarchical have put in machine

720
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,979
learning here as well and then it's a

721
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:17,009
latarian as well and I talked a little

722
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:19,259
bit about high modernism and how it

723
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:21,930
relates to all of these things put it

724
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:28,249
into sort of put it into a historical

725
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:28,249
perspective okay thank you

726
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:48,829
are there any questions so when this

727
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:53,119
sounds like a really cool project then

728
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:56,359
we're gonna look a bit one two okay so

729
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,280
my question is it sounds like every user

730
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,890
will have their own keys and their own

731
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,160
identity and so on yes is there any

732
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:11,328
building ways of handling anonymity and

733
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:14,660
privacy yeah so so the system is so when

734
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:16,670
you actually start up as a user you get

735
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,180
your own key and you don't have to

736
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,980
reveal anything about yourself and then

737
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,660
you can and then you can communicate

738
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,309
with the other notes as well and often

739
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,500
when you communicate you for example

740
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:29,839
leaked information about yourself let's

741
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,460
say that you you connect your pop and

742
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,839
then you have an IP address this means

743
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,529
that you leaked information about where

744
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:40,190
you are on the world and we can and we

745
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:44,390
can do a connecters / / / tour here

746
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:46,190
which means that you are actually not

747
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,770
revealing anything more that you want

748
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:51,230
then you can then on top of this you can

749
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,359
put in everything you want to do like

750
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:55,579
pictures of yourself or names of

751
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,640
yourself but it's not like in facebook

752
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:00,319
we're actually required to use your real

753
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,020
name in order to use the system you can

754
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:07,940
have it any way you want to speak in any

755
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,220
way you feel comfortable with but it was

756
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:13,220
actually interesting is that when I

757
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:16,339
started using this system I had like a

758
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:18,259
normal profile I didn't post that much

759
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:20,270
about myself but actually over time

760
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,950
there's a really really great community

761
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,770
here and people really care about each

762
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,689
other then you start revealing more

763
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,900
about yourself and sharing more stories

764
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:32,059
just out of sharing with the people that

765
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,770
you care for in the system it's really

766
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:36,109
interesting to see these dynamics and

767
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,410
play but you are open to do that when

768
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:38,410
you want

769
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:50,440
um thank you for the talk that was that

770
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,260
was great um I I really like scuttlebutt

771
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,840
but I also have some misgivings about

772
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,460
the way that I've seen it like by

773
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,680
default it seems like it's actually not

774
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,630
very privacy friendly at all like it

775
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,960
goes on the local area network and

776
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,130
announces your identity when you install

777
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,540
patchwork I don't know if this was like

778
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,550
a year ago I don't know if that's still

779
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,680
the case but then like every pub you

780
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,650
connect to you tell it all the things

781
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,020
that you want so that you can get them

782
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,810
if it has them but they they can

783
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:22,830
identify you from that right so is it

784
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:27,460
has it gotten any easier to use it in a

785
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:30,130
privacy sort of conscious fashion to not

786
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,780
just broadcast your identity to your

787
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:35,260
land and like a list of who you're

788
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:37,330
following in yeah yeah so so one of the

789
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,780
things that underscores has been working

790
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:42,670
on is a new connection manager which

791
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,190
actually means that you have to have to

792
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:47,290
open when opt in when you connect

793
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,720
through pops for example or local area

794
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:52,240
connections or bluetooth for example so

795
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,859
that once you run around with your phone

796
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,868
and somebody else comes in they could

797
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:58,630
just not necessarily just connect you

798
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:00,609
you have to actually authorize in order

799
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,859
to exchange that data but the other

800
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:05,200
thing is that once you have this public

801
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:07,869
data it is public and then it's actually

802
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,810
start spreading around like gossip in

803
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:13,090
the system and the only good way to

804
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:15,190
actually solve this is going to be with

805
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,480
these private groups and private groups

806
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,770
are going to solve a lot of these

807
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,770
problems as well

808
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:28,019
for the private groups are you thinking

809
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,819
about having different feeds for the

810
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,169
private communication because like when

811
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,999
you put the private messages in your

812
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:35,999
public feed that gives you a nice sort

813
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:38,069
of a receiver on observability it would

814
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:40,169
seem like but if two people are having a

815
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:43,319
conversation like you can sort of infer

816
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:46,859
that like since everybody sees it when

817
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:49,979
you're sending so like are you are you

818
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:52,919
thinking about having different feeds or

819
00:43:49,979 --> 00:43:54,689
still just one feed for everything well

820
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:56,189
it's sort of up to you you could do

821
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:58,618
whatever you like if you want to

822
00:43:56,189 --> 00:44:02,009
communicate privately and not

823
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,599
necessarily put these feeds you can do a

824
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:05,880
different feeds but then you can still

825
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,529
try to correlate these things what I

826
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,259
would say about the system which is

827
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:12,929
interesting is that it's very delayed

828
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:17,539
tolerant this means that you can post a

829
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:20,130
message and and the next day or like

830
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:21,660
another time actually exchange the

831
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,519
message you don't necessarily have to

832
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,428
exchange the message right away so you

833
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,988
can add this delays which makes it

834
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:29,669
really hard to figure out who's

835
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:31,439
necessarily communicating with each

836
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:34,529
other but that's a trade-off of

837
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:36,689
anonymity towards or and on the other

838
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:39,049
side like how fast you want the system

839
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:46,799
goes like traditional any kind of

840
00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:49,819
anonymous system has this trade-off any

841
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:49,819
other questions

842
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:01,470
you mentioned the Linux kernel thing

843
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:02,790
using SSB for internal do you know if

844
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:06,859
anything has happened with that is

845
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:11,970
anyone actually going to get that during

846
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:14,339
no so I think that the message was

847
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:18,299
posted on his blog as a way to sort of

848
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:21,779
start the conversation and you could see

849
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:24,540
that that's people worse were discussing

850
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:27,810
about this by themselves but as far as I

851
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:31,020
know there hasn't come anything out of

852
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:33,328
it and it and if something comes out of

853
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,280
it I have a feeling that it not

854
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:39,000
necessarily going to be SSB but

855
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,510
something is be like bubbling but with

856
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,140
the same ideas I think but I haven't

857
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:54,329
happened anything like concrete with

858
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:55,950
this any other questions okay then

859
00:45:54,329 --> 00:46:00,050
that's have another round of applause

860
00:45:55,950 --> 00:46:00,049
for thank you

861
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,520
[Applause]
