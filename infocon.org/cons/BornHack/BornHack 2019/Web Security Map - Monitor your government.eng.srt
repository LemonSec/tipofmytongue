1
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,320
you

2
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:26,170
morning we're going to have Elgar stitch

3
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:32,569
Janka to talk about the web security map

4
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:36,470
thank you well the Zbornak has been

5
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:38,720
absolutely magnificent till now because

6
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,239
now I'm a little bit nervous and also

7
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,290
I'm regretting that I have drunk so much

8
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,519
alcohol

9
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:49,040
yesterday and now at one hour ago I

10
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,980
started looking for my slides and they

11
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,690
were nowhere to be found so don't worry

12
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,030
there's a lot to show-and-tell but at

13
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,790
this it will have a little bit of an

14
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,650
improvisation characteristic to to the

15
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:10,010
presentation and maybe that's for the

16
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:12,350
better that we will find out so me and a

17
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,200
friend of mine made a nice tool it was

18
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:18,829
called web security map and it is a tool

19
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,560
to monitor governments and there's like

20
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,959
there's this paradigm of the government

21
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,060
is monitoring you and they are keeping

22
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,440
you down and under control that's not

23
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,090
the point the point is the other way

24
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,470
around let's monitor the government see

25
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,079
what they do see if they do things

26
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,510
correctly and see if they're of any help

27
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,380
and you can do this in many ways and one

28
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:44,780
of the ways that you can do this is to

29
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:49,670
see if they're doing the minimum level

30
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:51,829
of security and that's something that

31
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:56,450
you can automate and you can visualize

32
00:03:51,829 --> 00:04:00,079
and that's what this tool does I'll

33
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,980
first introduce myself I'm alpha state

34
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,280
junker

35
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:08,630
I'm since last Friday I'm the provider

36
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,910
of cyber this is the we ordered some

37
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,489
cyber stickers so that once you see

38
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:17,149
around the camp are from that batch

39
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:21,019
and we had a lot of fun ordering and

40
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:22,969
sorting cyber stickers still 4 a.m. in

41
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:31,070
the morning to make sure everybody would

42
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:32,780
get their share I have a lot of projects

43
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,300
in the hacker community and in the

44
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:40,280
hacker scene I've been involved in sha

45
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:44,720
2017 I've helped found a few Dutch

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,929
hacker spaces and now I'm working on a

47
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:55,490
piece of software which is written in

48
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:58,880
Python the idea is let's make the world

49
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:04,729
a better place let's make it nicer and

50
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:09,110
friendlier and I will show you how what

51
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:11,469
my approach was to that and I will start

52
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,419
with an example from the Netherlands and

53
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,150
we have installed web security map

54
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:20,270
software in the Netherlands and we call

55
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,810
it basis by violating dot Annelle which

56
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:27,260
is basic security dot Annelle and the

57
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,570
other domain was file guard it's film a

58
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,900
port map of failure of the government

59
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,409
which was awesome in branding and

60
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,299
getting attention so if you plan of

61
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:41,150
rolling this software out you can choose

62
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,360
something like film map dot DK or

63
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,880
something it will get attention from the

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,370
government and that's fun and things

65
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,280
will change and that's also fun so I'll

66
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:57,199
show you a little bit of what that

67
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,479
software looks like I also really like

68
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:06,580
the wavy screen it's actually it's it's

69
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:09,919
really awesome here we go so this is the

70
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:13,969
software running live right now and what

71
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,969
it does is this is the shape is the

72
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:21,020
country of the Netherlands all the areas

73
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:25,219
colored areas are municipalities there's

74
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:28,299
also a map of provinces

75
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:36,279
trying to load that now I hope I did not

76
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:36,279
do I have Internet's maybe maybe not

77
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:46,068
but here you see all the municipalities

78
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:49,248
at least and there's a lot and you see

79
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:53,539
that there's a lot of red area some are

80
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:55,459
orange and some are green and we can

81
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,128
zoom in a little bit on what you what

82
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:00,589
you're seeing here for example there's

83
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:05,299
this island in an island

84
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:10,009
it's called daesil oh wait wait

85
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:14,269
maybe it's it's but it's not this is

86
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:17,539
improvisation now we can zoom in on

87
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:21,319
daesil and see that they have a number

88
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:25,248
of risks currently they have a number of

89
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,699
domains that they showed exposed to the

90
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:30,709
world like not too many and there's a

91
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,169
lot of things that these domains get

92
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:37,419
checked on and in terms of security it's

93
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:40,818
really the most basic bare-bones

94
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:44,989
kindergarten level of security like do

95
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:48,439
you have your encryption set to on do

96
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:52,758
you have some headers set correctly for

97
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:55,069
email and for ftp and for web so it's

98
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,169
really that the lowest bar that you can

99
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:00,259
get in terms of security and that's what

100
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:04,909
most that's that this allows for easy

101
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:06,979
scanning also and it says then here for

102
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:10,099
this domain some things have been

103
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:12,498
checked and they are not correct and and

104
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,329
was last checked seven days ago and was

105
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:17,389
for four months ago it was also

106
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:21,669
incorrect so here you can see that this

107
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:25,639
domain from a test domain from the Dutch

108
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:27,649
municipality is not correct because you

109
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,759
don't need to test your security on test

110
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:35,870
domains right no of course you do so

111
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,919
this is red but it this software tests a

112
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,000
lot of

113
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,130
a really low level security issues but

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,730
it does this unmask and it displays it

115
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:50,570
in a nice graph a nice nice map and this

116
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:53,329
map is really the key it's something

117
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,089
that can be understood by everybody

118
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:57,800
working at a government from the

119
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:01,940
management layer which makes the

120
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,819
decision to the IT operators and I found

121
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,860
that many of the IT operators want to

122
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,670
fix things but are not a lot at the

123
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,800
budget to do that now that they are read

124
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,170
on a map they actually got time and

125
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,540
money to fix those those things which is

126
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,969
great

127
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,860
you can also filter a little bit for

128
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,389
example we can filter on the domain name

129
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,920
security at the NSTIC here you see that

130
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:32,959
almost everybody does that right you see

131
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:36,740
this nice red area over here with that's

132
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,229
actually a domain that is shared by that

133
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,380
all those municipalities together and

134
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,459
the funny thing is that when

135
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,529
municipalities come together and have a

136
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:48,859
project together nobody is responsible

137
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:51,220
for it so they all started mailing me

138
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,860
like no no we're not in charge please

139
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,839
remove us from this list but if you go

140
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,600
to the website it says that they are in

141
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,430
charge so no that's really an

142
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,149
interesting dynamic that you that you

143
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:10,069
have it's also a source of entertainment

144
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:14,510
in that sense some areas are gray those

145
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:17,570
are well probably some a scanning issue

146
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,300
happened most are green most are doing

147
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,510
pretty well you can also look at the

148
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,519
trust of your certificates so there this

149
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,459
these are all the municipalities that

150
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,079
have certificates with trust issues you

151
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:32,209
can we can look at the quality of

152
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,219
decryption with encryption which is a

153
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:35,930
lot higher because self-signed

154
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,279
certificates are seen as a trust issue

155
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,388
so you see that there's in terms of

156
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,709
absolute quality it's pretty high

157
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,050
starting my to read and we can do that

158
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:49,020
for a lot of other things for example

159
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,270
the

160
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,360
our areas or municipalities that have

161
00:10:51,270 --> 00:11:00,089
websites that do not have encryption at

162
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:07,529
all same goes for File Transfer Protocol

163
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:12,270
FTP and email so there are five

164
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:18,149
municipalities left that have incorrect

165
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:20,390
email security which is very low but

166
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,040
that's something that web security map

167
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,620
visualizes for you and you can do that

168
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,490
for your country and that's the point of

169
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,720
this presentation I hope to find people

170
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:36,779
that want to run this for Denmark and

171
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,510
every other country in the world it's a

172
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:43,350
lot of fun it's a lot of entertainment

173
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:47,339
and the the the the level apprec-- of

174
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,970
appreciation is very high so if you plan

175
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:53,100
to do this to run this offer for Denmark

176
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:58,200
you'll have a very nice and and

177
00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:03,420
entertaining right what does this do

178
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,020
more it does some statistics like Google

179
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,229
are the worst

180
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:11,010
it's these are these are not

181
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:15,930
municipalities I think there's a bug or

182
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:20,850
something yeah I rewrote the whole

183
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:23,189
website a week ago so just four so

184
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,459
there's not not so we can see clearly

185
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,279
that Amsterdam is is currently the

186
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:31,739
profit municipality with the largest

187
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,160
number of high risks and miss apart

188
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:41,010
which which is some small thing small

189
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:42,870
municipality is close second and we can

190
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:46,020
also see that there are municipalities

191
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,839
that actually have everything in order

192
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,089
like the frisian mayor or a fee area

193
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,920
which are all small municipalities are

194
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:58,980
relatively low number of inhabitants

195
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,889
it creates the nice reports with graphs

196
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,449
it rates overviews

197
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:09,839
what changed over the past few months

198
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:12,748
what does it do more it gives an insight

199
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,079
of how many services are running like

200
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:18,629
for example how many HTTP now are HTTP

201
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:24,059
services are running on a beefy ipv4 or

202
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:25,980
six which is also you can see the number

203
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:30,929
of improvements in the last seven days

204
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:33,839
in in totals you can see the graphs over

205
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:36,119
time over the last year so here you see

206
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,379
and that's that that's the most

207
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:42,379
important thing you see this slightly

208
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:45,389
slope that goes slightly downwards and

209
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:48,660
that means that a lot of security issues

210
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,389
are getting fixed and that's the awesome

211
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,988
thing to see and that's the biggest

212
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:57,749
benefit of running software like this

213
00:13:53,989 --> 00:14:00,809
you can see that very clearly with DNS

214
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:04,559
SEC domain name security you can see

215
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:07,738
that last year there are still 60

216
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:11,069
domains that were not properly protected

217
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:13,259
and now it's about ten so they're doing

218
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:15,689
very well and they're taking this very

219
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:19,290
serious you can also see this in the

220
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:21,919
trust issues that they also go down down

221
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:27,860
down down and that's really nice to see

222
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:30,689
this also gives the the owners of the

223
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,759
infra the opportunity to actually do

224
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:35,429
something and see that their that they

225
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:41,429
are achieving something which is also

226
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:44,260
nice well there's I think that's

227
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:47,370
basically it

228
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,370
[Music]

229
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:58,990
the we are running this on a very cheap

230
00:14:54,749 --> 00:15:01,629
VPS I think we pay about 50 euros a

231
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,660
month if you have some hardware laying

232
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:07,329
around with some okay specs like from

233
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:14,639
five years ago you'll be able to run

234
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:17,888
this very easily for zero euros and you

235
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,709
just get a domain name and you just set

236
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:28,149
it up then that's the next part of this

237
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:30,748
presentation so what the web security

238
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:35,319
web software is completely open source

239
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:38,529
it's written it's on the it's it's bit

240
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:42,719
hard to see I'll show the URL more

241
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:49,480
clearly which is also still very small

242
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:54,009
so life editing presentations so it's on

243
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:57,399
get lab comm slash internet - clean up -

244
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:02,589
foundation if you will search for it you

245
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:06,179
will probably find it the project is

246
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:10,329
completely open source it has had

247
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:13,410
funding from the Dutch domain name

248
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:16,329
register the dot NL domain name register

249
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,329
they fund a number of projects and this

250
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:22,420
was one of them and this also makes sure

251
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:25,059
that the software will be the in

252
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,599
development for the coming year at least

253
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:32,709
so and the the only goal that we have

254
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,509
now is to promote it and help people

255
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:37,239
getting started so if you want to run

256
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:41,259
this for yourself if you if you want to

257
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,620
learn this I'm there to help you to get

258
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,509
you started and get you past any

259
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:52,809
obstacles and make it easier for other

260
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:55,470
people to install it - what's more to

261
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,469
say yeah

262
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:09,680
question thank you

263
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,360
is there an easy way to start adding say

264
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,730
organizations to this list as a non

265
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,948
programmer so oh I want to have my local

266
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,569
water board to be scanned as well

267
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:24,440
Oh fill it in here it will generate

268
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:29,600
report yes and no the installation of

269
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:33,530
the of the of the software is as I'll go

270
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:40,270
into that what it does this map is all

271
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:40,270
generated from open data sources so the

272
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:47,750
what's it called the polygons or the

273
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,169
shapes of these municipalities are taken

274
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:53,090
from Open Street Map and domains that

275
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:59,330
are associated with them are taken from

276
00:17:53,090 --> 00:18:01,370
wiki data so if you install this you can

277
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,320
basically specify I want to start with

278
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,110
this country and it will get the data

279
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,750
from several layers of your government

280
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:12,949
plus the domains and it will start

281
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:16,850
scanning them for you so that's one big

282
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:19,100
part that solves that problem and it's

283
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,590
possible for a non programmer there is

284
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,320
an admin interface I can probably show

285
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:32,120
this which is basically the standard

286
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:34,540
generic admin I should not enable by

287
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,540
proxy

288
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,418
Oh

289
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:51,820
not convincing so if you're running this

290
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,530
as a non programmer you can just use the

291
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,540
admin interface which is a cumbersome

292
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,970
way to add things you can also do this

293
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:02,290
using the command line there are videos

294
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:06,179
about how to do that yeah going to log

295
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,178
in now no thank you

296
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,170
it takes some time

297
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:18,340
basically you'll see here some somewhere

298
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,840
there's a list of URLs there's there's

299
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,428
actually in this installation that we're

300
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,309
running there's actually the entire

301
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:27,160
Dutch government with everything but

302
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:32,168
it's humongous it's it's ridiculously

303
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:36,400
large and it is 29,000 URLs now so it's

304
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:39,250
also gets in in the amounts that it gets

305
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,490
ridiculous to manage and what we do now

306
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,929
is we just add one domain for example

307
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,290
Amsterdam Cottonelle and there are

308
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,330
several scripts that automatically find

309
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,149
every subdomain from Amsterdam

310
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,899
Cottonelle and it uses the uses several

311
00:19:52,150 --> 00:20:02,110
techniques that are well known to

312
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:04,059
security testers like n1 hashes hashing

313
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,820
issue so you can zone lock the whole

314
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:10,090
domain etc but basically the software

315
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,629
will get all domains from top-level

316
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,159
domain so that helps a lot so just enter

317
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:27,100
one domain and it will find a few

318
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:30,880
hundred more the last part is we're

319
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,250
starting a program that's called monitor

320
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,870
your government which is one of the

321
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,770
talks is this one this is one of the

322
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:41,799
first one and it tells what this

323
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:44,260
software does and how you can get it and

324
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,879
how to how you can use it the website is

325
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,070
monitor your government dot o-r-g

326
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,900
you can see also the what it did in the

327
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,080
Netherlands when we started it was like

328
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,150
this red blob

329
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,570
and over time slowly things started

330
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,970
improving and improved me and it's very

331
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:07,480
very subtle very strict so if you have

332
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,789
one mistake you are red so if you are

333
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,010
green on this map that means that you

334
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:17,620
really really have your stuff in order

335
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:20,260
which is a very nice achievement all

336
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,658
right this is a nice example of how you

337
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,600
howdy nesic got adopted in the

338
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:27,730
Netherlands

339
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,580
you see here you see the change is

340
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:35,559
happening some improvements to the

341
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:38,408
scanners and voila that's like from a

342
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:41,168
lot of red to one giant part of red

343
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,600
because this is another group of

344
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:46,570
municipalities that all share one single

345
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,678
domain that nobody dares to manage and

346
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:52,510
they can fight until somebody takes

347
00:21:49,679 --> 00:22:00,940
responsibility until that they are all

348
00:21:52,510 --> 00:22:03,580
red so what does it do more it shows

349
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,970
statistics etc oh there's also something

350
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:11,490
else mmm because you're monitoring

351
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:14,620
security at scale of institutions that

352
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:20,340
process a lot of sensitive data there's

353
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:24,939
this thing that's called ethics and that

354
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:27,789
prevents prevents you from scanning from

355
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,120
actual real security vulnerabilities

356
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:34,570
like sequel injection or open databases

357
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,549
or admin interfaces that are available

358
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,990
to the public

359
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:41,080
technically it's easy to scan them there

360
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,559
are thousands of tools that work that

361
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,379
you can do that but would you publish

362
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:50,500
would you publicize a number of open

363
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,630
databases from governments the result

364
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,659
would be that things are getting worse

365
00:22:52,630 --> 00:23:01,360
because everybody can now get that data

366
00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:04,260
so we only are able to monitor very

367
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,330
basic and trivial security issues

368
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,580
otherwise

369
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:12,240
everybody would be able to access all

370
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,370
data from everybody and that's a problem

371
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,820
there are other tools to do that there

372
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,709
are other processes to do that so web

373
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,658
security map does only the basics that

374
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,659
you can get away with around the globe

375
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:32,820
there's a number of videos on the

376
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:36,689
monitor your government websites

377
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:40,320
it's a DOS it shows how to install this

378
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:43,320
how to import your countries how the

379
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,950
admin interface works what you can

380
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:51,320
configure there's a lot to configure you

381
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:54,539
can add organizations and URLs using

382
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,549
spreadsheets so you can download the

383
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:58,049
sample spreadsheets and just fill it out

384
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:01,110
with all the domains that you want to

385
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:04,158
add which is also a great way to add

386
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:07,830
like thousands and thousands of domains

387
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:11,240
I've tested it up to like Dutch

388
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:15,178
municipalities about 7,000 domains now

389
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:19,190
I've tested up to 15,000 domains and it

390
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,840
still functions very properly cheap and

391
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,429
low powered hardware which is fun I

392
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,309
don't think it will run on your

393
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:28,200
Raspberry Pi although the latest one has

394
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:39,330
four gigabyte or something so maybe it

395
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:42,120
does so this has made a profound impact

396
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:46,168
on how security and IT is done in the

397
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:49,018
Netherlands for municipalities for a lot

398
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:51,230
of them this is the go-to tool to see if

399
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:56,039
they are doing right which is awesome

400
00:24:51,230 --> 00:25:00,110
and they're also actively trying to help

401
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:04,019
to make the scanners better to to to to

402
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:06,090
add when they have a new project they

403
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,279
just smell like oh we have a new domain

404
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:12,510
please add it to this list so we can

405
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:15,750
monitor it and there's some project

406
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,879
going on to make sure that they can do

407
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,610
that themselves because I'm not their

408
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,670
arty person

409
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:25,590
I'm just somebody pointing out that hey

410
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,590
you should maybe do something about this

411
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:34,780
so yeah that's basically my talk if you

412
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:38,470
want to run this in Denmark or your

413
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:42,870
country I see a lot of people here who

414
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:45,820
wants to give this a try who wants to

415
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,909
alright that's a lot of people say that

416
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,980
we like in five minutes just meet up

417
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,309
here in front of the stage and exchange

418
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,070
contact details and see that we can just

419
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:59,889
set us up because that would be great

420
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,629
and maybe there's more people from the

421
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:09,460
same country that means that are more

422
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:12,580
people in one team that also helps so

423
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:16,780
this is my contact info for the viewers

424
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,520
at home it's alpha at internet cleanup

425
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,700
not foundation it also has my phone

426
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:26,020
number which is also public information

427
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,730
already so yeah that's basically it

428
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,590
let's meet up here in front of the stage

429
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,429
and if there are any questions I think

430
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,428
now's the time

431
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:43,290
yes really cool too I'm definitely

432
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,080
seeing myself playing with it but in

433
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:50,100
terms of moving forward with it I have a

434
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,470
bit I have some concerns that of how to

435
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,790
actually get this in their attention and

436
00:26:52,470 --> 00:27:00,030
take it seriously because I'm expecting

437
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:03,149
questions like okay weird so what how

438
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,520
how bad is that or I'm not seeing them

439
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,140
seeing the really tangible impact of

440
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,210
this now I'd really like for you to

441
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,830
detail how did you manage to get this

442
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:15,420
into the attention of the Dutch

443
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:22,320
authorities wow that's a funny story

444
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:26,030
actually what I did was I as when I was

445
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,360
working as a pen tester I was invited as

446
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:32,970
one of the there was a conference about

447
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,178
security for governments for

448
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,309
municipalities specifically and I was to

449
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,770
they had to spend out of four of these

450
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:42,570
epic hacker people like everybody knew

451
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,480
them they've been in the media and it

452
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:48,689
was me the hacker from the sponsor like

453
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,090
like that's like you are pay yeah you're

454
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,240
being paid to sit there and to look good

455
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,220
and and cool but yeah nobody knows you

456
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,000
so I had to make some kind of name for

457
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,760
myself and what better way to do that by

458
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,190
just burning everybody that is there so

459
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,440
there was like 200 Steve security

460
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,290
officers in that room from all kinds of

461
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,179
municipalities and we started with oh

462
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,460
yeah in the last three days I've made

463
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,080
this map and here you are and you are

464
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,120
all read please do something about it

465
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,970
and everybody started panicking and

466
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:26,239
calling and the buzzing happened and

467
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,240
then the there's this security

468
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:34,559
organization that does security for

469
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:38,100
municipalities they have their deaf this

470
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,200
this is this thing that helps all these

471
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,919
municipalities they made them themselves

472
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,530
and it it gets it got in their intention

473
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:49,440
and they started mailing everybody like

474
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,970
oh this tool is new and you can expect

475
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,580
press

476
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,700
questions from this so they did the

477
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,370
marketing there's probably also in

478
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,130
Denver Denmark an organization that

479
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,840
helps governments improve our

480
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,050
municipalities improve their security

481
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,730
and when those people send out the meal

482
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:25,450
then yeah and then things will happen

483
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:28,220
pretty good pretty well yeah I think yes

484
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,770
yeah there's there's another alternative

485
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,750
is instead of if you cannot get their

486
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,430
attention you can always go to the media

487
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:39,050
because everybody can understand this

488
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:41,930
nice image and in the Netherlands we if

489
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:44,570
there's the open state foundation that

490
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:48,830
has done that three times and that

491
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:50,210
really also created this buzz so and

492
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,689
there's a lot of countries where that

493
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:55,430
does not have that didn't happen yet so

494
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,130
there's still room to do that so you can

495
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:01,940
go to the newspapers and say this is

496
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:09,220
going on which has news value which is

497
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:09,220
awesome yeah any other questions

498
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:21,039
hey could you tell us a bit more about

499
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:26,499
how you find the domains in the regions

500
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:29,350
oh yeah sure I have to dig a bit let's

501
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:33,479
let's get some let's get Amsterdam for

502
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:39,399
example there are there's a lot of stuff

503
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:43,659
one of the approaches is there's the day

504
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:46,199
of a lot but there's some graph here for

505
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,200
a moment please

506
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,249
okay I have field

507
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,779
so one of the ways to get domains is

508
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,239
there's this technique called domain

509
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:01,299
name security TNS ik and they have

510
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:04,570
various implementations of that and one

511
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:06,460
is called an sac one hashing which has

512
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,769
to do with signing of gaps between

513
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,739
domains and there's a weakness in that

514
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:15,820
that you can use to zone walk so you can

515
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:17,799
start and enumerate all the gaps between

516
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,259
domains and therefore you know all the

517
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:29,349
domains and there's a tool that does

518
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:33,879
that another called have at a very very

519
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:38,830
popular DNS enumeration tool also

520
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:40,779
written invitin but that tool i've just

521
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:43,299
programmed this wrapper around around

522
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:45,070
the tool and ask like yeah this is a

523
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:47,139
domain get the rest of them and it

524
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,149
responds in like 10 seconds and you have

525
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,789
one or two hundred domains of a

526
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:53,340
municipality so it uses anzick-1 hashing

527
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:57,940
it used the certificate rinse

528
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:58,988
transparency database so every HTTP

529
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,830
website

530
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:06,389
when you register or when you get a

531
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:09,070
certificate for that website this

532
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:11,080
information is published at a few

533
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:15,840
databases and you can also scrape those

534
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,769
databases you can ask search engines

535
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,899
what are the subdomains

536
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:23,830
if you are a little bit of creative so

537
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:26,559
that's what it does and I think there

538
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,090
are one or two other ways that oh yeah

539
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,639
it also does

540
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:36,590
brute-forcing of subdomains in a way

541
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:39,289
that it also understands the about guard

542
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,730
certificates so it also understands that

543
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:44,510
that something is a wild card and

544
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,890
something is not so even if you have

545
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:49,750
vault card certificates it can also

546
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:52,850
brute force and it does it in a way like

547
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:55,700
municipality a has ten domains and we

548
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,980
try those ten domains at municipality B

549
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:05,570
and C and E and all the other ones and

550
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:08,750
that data set becomes like like twenty

551
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,908
to thirty percent correct for every

552
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:14,480
municipality which is pretty high hit

553
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:17,390
rate and it does all these this

554
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,950
accumulation of domains every like week

555
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,919
so every week there are more domains

556
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,470
every week some disappear and you see

557
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,490
that over time does it answer your

558
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:34,010
question cool

559
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:37,340
any other questions nope then I like us

560
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:40,300
to give alga a big hand for this very

561
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:46,539
inspiring talk thank you

562
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:46,539
[Applause]
