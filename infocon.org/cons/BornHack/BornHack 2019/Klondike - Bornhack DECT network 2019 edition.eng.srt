1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:12,299
so hi everyone please welcome Klondike

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:15,239
to the stage well let's talk about

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,870
telephony networks today this is going

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,270
to be amazing

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,350
so before we start how many of you did

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,320
manage to register his phone nobody has

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,619
been using Tyvek telephony network here

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,710
okay only one person that's amazing well

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,510
for to serve you that don't know it this

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,300
is basically the second year that we are

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,399
having an internal telephony network you

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,750
can call a lot of people here that we

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,629
have a special phone numbers for example

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,410
for contacting a orga we have phone

15
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,210
numbers for contacting the cert team and

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,599
well we'd like to say that it work it

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,559
really well but to be sincere it work it

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,320
better last year so first things first

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,300
please if by any reason you have found

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,899
one of the four antennas that we are

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,959
missing

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,299
they are model RFP 43 they look more or

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,979
less like this please contact us

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,689
immediately because we have in looking

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,789
like like crazy for them there was also

26
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,679
something really nice growing in me this

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,700
is basically a really nice views of the

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,850
Israel a really nice picture of the

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,890
pneumonia bacteria that's the reason why

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,020
it took me long to come and that sucks

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,659
because I was the I am basically the one

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,270
that has most experience on the team

33
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:35,520
which meant that nor who is over there

34
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,210
and only had to try to solve what they

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,429
could basically laocoön came to my place

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,500
before he was coming here he took like

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,509
the box we favorite every single

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,909
piece of equipment equipment we were

39
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,070
going to bring here I was like but maybe

40
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,899
we should test it and no we didn't have

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,539
enough time to intestine well things so

42
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,619
he came here and had to fight around it

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,460
well we were also doing some planning we

44
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,960
got this really nice network map that

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,408
you might recognize what the play or

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,179
talk it didn't look too bad you see we

47
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,739
were basically making the math okay we

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,140
are going to put one access point here

49
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,230
we are going to put another one here

50
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,350
maybe another one here another one here

51
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,660
and another one here but we lost four of

52
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,400
the access points and the other three we

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,609
had were supposed to be experts for the

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,320
next seven years which meant that at the

55
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,750
end we'll have had basically one here

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,790
through here and one somewhere in a tree

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,650
over there so well the thing is that

58
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:41,070
everything look at really nice on this

59
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,620
really flat map yeah

60
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,500
well this is basically how the place

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,510
looks like it's as you can see it's one

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,260
of these saints is basically a small

63
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,760
hill deliverance is not that big I mean

64
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,220
the highest hills are probably around

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,649
five seven meters compared to the

66
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,489
surrounding terrain but they are made of

67
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:05,430
really really really highly reflective

68
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:07,080
material and there is no wait waves of

69
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,260
the telephony Network and go through

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,180
them we were just having some other

71
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,899
interesting travel until I managed to

72
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:19,760
get healthy enough to be able to come we

73
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,590
were trying to configure a 10 Tina's and

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,560
well if you want to configure antennas

75
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,930
don't use cubes there is apparently

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,390
stones and we really will things going

77
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,980
with the way in which the java

78
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,859
application you said to configure

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,290
antennas understnad working that makes

80
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,760
cubes totally dislike it and well it was

81
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,329
basically impossible to get things

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,030
working with cubes so well starting tail

83
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,799
and we did a small insane deployment we

84
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,739
had three clusters that is basically

85
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,430
three independent dec networks saying

86
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,140
the same database of registrations which

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,810
meant that it was impossible to roam

88
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,970
from one area to the other we only had

89
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,970
basically two power injectors a little

90
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,769
bit later we found a fair one we were

91
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,470
supposed to have to have six of them

92
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,950
actually we only had four antennas of

93
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,570
which one was the only one surviving

94
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,570
from last year until the three were

95
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,488
supposed to be espares and roaming was

96
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,200
literally not working I mean you gotta

97
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,358
start a call in the middle of the

98
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,849
general area I started working hard away

99
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,560
over there on the fourth area and at

100
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:26,800
some point your car could use cut

101
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,870
because you would lose taken

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,460
since the pre-roll antenna and being

103
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,889
able to move to the antenna that was

104
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,049
until ilaria the reason why we couldn't

105
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,849
get roaming working obtain bus was

106
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,159
because antennas need to see each other

107
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:41,319
in order to be able to do the handling

108
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,349
of the car from one area from one of the

109
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,900
antennas to the other but well when

110
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:48,580
everything seemed lost I mean we had

111
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,679
basically no coverage here on the

112
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,948
speaker's area we had no combination

113
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,729
tannoy see area no cover it's on Tamar

114
00:04:52,949 --> 00:05:00,219
well we had a lot of help the people of

115
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:03,128
the NOC were really nice provided

116
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:05,620
switches with power over ethernet that

117
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:07,030
allowed us to actually power some of the

118
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,180
antennas despite we only had two

119
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,739
injectors we had two really nice people

120
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,020
climbing trees in order to placed

121
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,389
antennas as high as possible

122
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,330
I definitively was not able to do that

123
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,909
so here is a big suit out for AMI and

124
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,500
Sariah which actually were the ones that

125
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:25,469
were climbing the trees in order

126
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,819
to placed antennas as high as possible

127
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:30,789
most of the deployment was actually

128
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,560
initially made my raccoon over there and

129
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:36,009
by Omni whilst I was sitting on my tent

130
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,449
trying not to die and well I thought was

131
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,430
really nice because he provided us

132
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,289
really long cables that we could use in

133
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,680
order to have two antennas as high as we

134
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,909
could and the result was that well we

135
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,710
could manage to improve coverage

136
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:50,860
significantly I mean we at least could

137
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,020
cover all the area around the bar and so

138
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,469
on and you could have been wrong from

139
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,389
the front general camping area up to the

140
00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:02,349
areas around here with the food area and

141
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:03,940
the speaker's then and errands you can

142
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,729
actually get a little bit of coverage

143
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,529
here it's really bad you probably need

144
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:11,680
to get out of the tent to take the call

145
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:15,009
but well at least you can notice that

146
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,219
somebody's calling you then we went on

147
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:20,889
to registration hell registration hell

148
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:23,199
is basically the procedure of picking up

149
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,569
you're really old force from the early

150
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,419
90s and trying to get them to work with

151
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,870
our network its form works in a totally

152
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,969
different way and for most of the moment

153
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,120
forms you can use a single at-will car

154
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:40,190
registration basically you used register

155
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,500
a user on the system get the phone

156
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,990
put a pink coat and then the phone gets

157
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,360
a history in the system but you know a

158
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,250
lot of phones did refuse to register

159
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,280
especially all that gigaset phones and

160
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,280
for that we had to get the identify of

161
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,919
the phone and uh basically what could we

162
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,650
call it a Mac basic registration or that

163
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,240
what we call an EPA registration the

164
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,489
problem is that the phones don't give

165
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,880
you type a they give you a different

166
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,250
accessible number callate eep-eep

167
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,480
that has to be them a converted in today

168
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,070
he pay using hi a special tool another

169
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,860
problem we had to statically some phones

170
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,510
or only a love for the heat so at some

171
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,490
points we had to basically reconfigure

172
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,580
the network to try to register with for

173
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,920
the it said effect and when we start

174
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,909
some phones in particular d'Oro phones

175
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,650
didn't even register and another problem

176
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,330
we had is some phones like white really

177
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,060
good signal in order to be able to do

178
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,950
the first registration and this year we

179
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,830
didn't had an antenna used on the polk

180
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,590
we had a close antenna hanging somewhere

181
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,690
in a tree but that at some times was not

182
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,549
powerful enough and that's the reason

183
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,190
why approximately one out of every three

184
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,880
phones we try to reuse them failed at

185
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:58,190
doing so and well thanks to raccoon we

186
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:04,280
also have some stats that we can so we

187
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:06,050
have a total of 850 six calls 58 users

188
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,840
were registered at that's basically 58

189
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,520
phones like this one up to four calls

190
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,619
were made concurrently which is really

191
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,219
nice because that's basically the limit

192
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,840
an antenna can support I mean its

193
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,360
antenna can support up to eight

194
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,830
concurrent calls but that basically

195
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,470
means eight phones

196
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,000
participating in a call so if you call

197
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,590
from one phone to another you are

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,100
basically using through a slow sort of

199
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,689
the a Tutera by label as you can see

200
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,860
well the number of cars has been

201
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,690
increasing over time

202
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,979
I guess that is probably in direct

203
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,440
proportion to the number of phones that

204
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:43,490
were registered and today we have

205
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,910
already done a 180 but we hope that this

206
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,760
number will increase and we had a token

207
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,670
in our telephony network and apparently

208
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,220
seven people have managed to fight

209
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,839
can actually one of them came asking if

210
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,160
he could learn one of our phones in

211
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,690
order to try to find it there are two

212
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,550
things we can do whether the first thing

213
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,180
is that next year we are asking alright

214
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,550
we can get really huge poles on top of

215
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,589
which we can placed antennas probably

216
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,390
something like 10 or 15 meters at least

217
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,610
so that we can get direct line of sight

218
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:20,210
between antennas and between the phones

219
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,680
and containers hopefully we will be able

220
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,360
to have enough time to look for a

221
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,979
sponsor to have better equipment that

222
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,180
was the objective in last year so you

223
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,370
can see how well we follow it up on it

224
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:34,670
we will try to keep dogs on how to do

225
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,710
registrations so that when we find to

226
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,810
start to register forms more than one

227
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,420
time we can probably speed up the

228
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,709
procedure the symbols that really we

229
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,390
will need to have more people doing

230
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,980
registration so that somebody can sit

231
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,880
down and write the dogs for the heart

232
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,620
phones there is a really nice app on the

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,630
internet to convert a pulley to Taipei

234
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,490
so we will I will probably sit down and

235
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,880
try to make a small javascript code that

236
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,650
can do the transformation yeah next year

237
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,250
we are testing things we do before we

238
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,630
leave I don't care if that means that

239
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,160
you will get two hours late to your

240
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:11,840
destination but we are testing things

241
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,819
before we leave yep we are also going to

242
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,440
try to track equipment better because

243
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,230
one of the reasons why we lost three

244
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,290
often Tina's were that they were placed

245
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,180
it on a box somewhere then boxes were

246
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,650
moved from one home to either nowhere

247
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,930
and the box is totally gone and

248
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,410
apparently we are not only teen that has

249
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,540
lost equipment and yeah hopefully next

250
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,880
year that will actually be sleep support

251
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,010
our objective at least is try to

252
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,820
collaborate with the pork with a network

253
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,740
operation center so that for example

254
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,860
places like the bar or the info desk can

255
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,900
have a proper tip phone and then we can

256
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,690
avoid having a having a struggles with

257
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,939
coverage in these areas for example the

258
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,530
info desk is a really problematic area

259
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,320
because it's basically as you know a

260
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,939
cabin made of metal we actually need

261
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,500
placed antenna on top of it and the

262
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,430
coverage was horrible amongst other

263
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,390
things because well

264
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,620
TechNet words don't really like

265
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,400
reflective and by domain

266
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,350
so we had a lot of salò paths going home

267
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:19,420
to the phones

268
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:21,650
oh yes I had forgotten to put it so yeah

269
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,780
we also planned to do some

270
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,620
pre-registration you probably saw that

271
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,600
we had a pad but we have enough time we

272
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,700
want to work on making a proper tool

273
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:38,870
that will handle that and that will

274
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:40,520
hopefully save us enough time so well it

275
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:45,820
is the list of people that we are really

276
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:50,449
thankful to the order is basically well

277
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:53,540
alphabetic almost a dot thanks a lot for

278
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,310
the cables Klondike well I found myself

279
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,189
because you know I have to be at least

280
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,140
anyways only thanks a lot for going hard

281
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,330
on the play at the project ara the

282
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:06,800
access points instead of treat them as

283
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:08,750
network stuff for me the funniest part

284
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:18,550
was being on the bottom of the tree

285
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:23,330
singing songs like falafel falafel ah

286
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,500
yeah thanks a lot to the organization

287
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,190
team for other support that they have

288
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,410
been providing us and oh that actually

289
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,990
should be reading knock team because the

290
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,400
POC team is our rally name it here

291
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,430
thanks a lot to the guys at the NOC for

292
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,959
at the help that we got from you thanks

293
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:43,729
raccoon for taking had equipment here

294
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,680
actually I should be thanking raccoon of

295
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,510
me and Tim gray Malmo on the bottom

296
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,239
because they basically set up the POC

297
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:54,890
tent worst I was trying to survive from

298
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,460
my place thanks a lot stem it because he

299
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,290
if you have a loan a phone most chances

300
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,840
are that it was systemic or a stem it's

301
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,459
mom that coated and donated it to us for

302
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,130
us to work yeah it's time it got ten

303
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,330
 forms for us

304
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,689
Rainier it's raining so no he's

305
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:16,520
something for desk well he has been

306
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,080
supporting the team since the first year

307
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,590
he was helping us a lot with the

308
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:27,990
covariates test

309
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:30,180
so that's yeah exactly he will boost he

310
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,880
says on that list because he has been

311
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,219
trying to help us with the SIP stuff I

312
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,100
thought we didn't get it working this

313
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,550
year and we could wish that Satya was

314
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,890
here I think he decided to hide away but

315
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,979
he's been basically our main contact

316
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,569
with the NOC team he has been setting up

317
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,960
all the stuff on the switches that we

318
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,090
needed

319
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:57,030
he was also climbing some of the trees

320
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:59,790
along with Romney over there yeah he so

321
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:02,189
we should really thank Sarah for other

322
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,860
hell that he provided us to set up the

323
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,620
system and the network but well

324
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,040
especially I think it's important to to

325
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,470
thank the most important members of the

326
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,170
poke team or basically terrorism when we

327
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,270
come here every year Nikki and s Mulan

328
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,099
which are the really nice talks you

329
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,270
might have met if you have tried to come

330
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,100
there to register at once so well
