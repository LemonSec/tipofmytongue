1
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:22,399
but blue who's going to talk

2
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:24,260
cobweb protocols thank you I already did

3
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,620
a good okay thank you

4
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,019
hello welcome I have had this

5
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,500
presentation in the Netherlands before

6
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:39,310
so there might be in some GUCH I'm Dutch

7
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:42,709
so expect a Chisholm's and Dutch isms

8
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:46,159
I'm a book blue I'm a hacker nerd geek

9
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,879
I'm a member of the most awesome hacker

10
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,370
space according to hackaday HEC 42 in

11
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,679
the Netherlands and also I'm a member of

12
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,159
the faced who are providing you with

13
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:05,440
free beer in the fridges near the food

14
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:11,659
area and please drink the free beer we

15
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:16,548
want to refill it so what do I do

16
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:19,130
I have a lot of projects and I have a

17
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:22,460
lot of other things I do but for this

18
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,039
talk important thing is I connect where

19
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,460
things to computers then you ask what

20
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:31,190
are weird things now things you normally

21
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:35,150
would not connect to the internet and

22
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:39,080
you shouldn't your door lock access

23
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,630
systems our heating for the heck fully

24
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,370
to building it's connected to the

25
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:48,229
Internet so it's operated for over the

26
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,780
internet works very fine cameras barcode

27
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:54,650
scanners coffee machines printers water

28
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:57,739
cookers payment terminals snack machines

29
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:04,150
weave computers where you make fabric

30
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:06,760
you can automat so more real things yes

31
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,409
but I don't know the exhaustive list

32
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,930
this is a nice image from our hack

33
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:15,340
foodie to heating SCADA system this is

34
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,050
actually how it's public on the website

35
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,080
you have to enter a password to send

36
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:27,550
some actions and please don't hack it we

37
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,550
rely on it fairly safe Faris

38
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,590
um do I do that all alone now of course

39
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,479
not

40
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:41,179
I'm basically not good in anything but I

41
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,790
can do a lot that means that I asked

42
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,610
help from my fellow hackers from

43
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,400
colleagues at work and yeah as you can

44
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,860
see I don't understand how you know I

45
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,830
know bit how a resistor works or the

46
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,970
commutator don't get me started and air

47
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,180
power is very dangerous but I manage

48
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,460
till now to stay alive

49
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,940
so what I'd use for it and I'm going to

50
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,620
talk a little bit about every thing

51
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,230
that's here on the slide

52
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:18,130
things like multimeter scope or logic

53
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:23,000
analyzer wireless networks some wires

54
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,219
soldering iron google yes Google is bad

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,700
this best search engine is still

56
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:33,230
available gambling and of course my

57
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:36,020
laptop and other computers so for you

58
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,290
wouldn't know that's multimeter it can

59
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,719
measure fools so that's how high the

60
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,880
power is it can measure amps that's how

61
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,910
much power goes through it can measure

62
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,150
ohms that's how good to power goes to

63
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:52,010
and it has a beep the beep is very

64
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,989
important because if you're measuring is

65
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,480
disconnected to that you don't have to

66
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,950
look at the display but you hear a very

67
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,920
annoying but you hear it

68
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,979
they start from about nothing in price

69
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:07,100
so make sure you have one there handy

70
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,870
and they can save your life also when

71
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,030
you actually dentally don't ground your

72
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,030
device you can measure it there you go

73
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,190
a scope scopes are difficult devices

74
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,610
they have a lot of functions but what I

75
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:25,460
basically do is they show a line of how

76
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:29,090
the power is moving or how bits yeah how

77
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,190
the power is moving from high and low it

78
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,890
can do a lot more I can say if you can

79
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,460
subtract at different voltages and

80
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:39,450
different signals it cost about a

81
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,289
hundred euros for a small one

82
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:45,060
they're very handy to carry around you

83
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:49,590
have big scopes they're very good at

84
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,930
measuring but yeah moving a complete

85
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,080
building to your office to measure it

86
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,520
it's not sufficient always and taking

87
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,830
the front door and say I'm gonna measure

88
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:05,520
this in your office is also not always

89
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:10,260
fairly accepted a logic analyzer a logic

90
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,990
analyzer is a very handy tool it can

91
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,510
lock the changes between a high and a

92
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:20,580
low voltage and there's from some very

93
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:25,010
efficient software to to look at the

94
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,010
signals I found image from that later

95
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:35,280
yeah wires wires are basically copper if

96
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,579
you don't want to touch each other

97
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,390
accidentally they have isolation and you

98
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:46,020
can make them from old bigger cables or

99
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,630
things like that and they come mainly in

100
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,040
three varieties and you want them all if

101
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:56,490
you start doing something tinkering a

102
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:59,849
soldiering iron doesn't need to be a big

103
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,270
one you have them as fairly small as use

104
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:09,750
be connected so they work on the power

105
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:13,770
bank some are actually good internet I

106
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,900
don't have to tell you about it gambling

107
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,750
gambling is when something is

108
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,280
undocumented and you have to guess how

109
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,880
the other persons were thinking when

110
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,189
programming it's the easy way to break

111
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,650
it but it's sometimes also the easiest

112
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,900
way to make it work even if you have the

113
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,870
documentation when it's a few thousand

114
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,720
pages you can just let's guess huh this

115
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:43,260
works and then maybe you look it up in

116
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:47,880
the documentation later a laptop can can

117
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:52,600
be a PC or something I use Linux but Mac

118
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,460
also works and yeah it's

119
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,880
basically all the software works on all

120
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,370
the main platforms Android phones mainly

121
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,160
now can also connect to an oscilloscope

122
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:08,470
and a logic analyzer and so even your

123
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:11,100
phone would do for a lot of things so

124
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,130
when you get a device and you don't have

125
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,480
or you want to connect it to something

126
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,660
there are a lot of possible connections

127
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:25,570
so Network serial parallel analog or

128
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:29,370
Wireless this picture is not taken in

129
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,370
Albania this is ripped from the internet

130
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:41,860
yes you ask a good question I like that

131
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:45,220
you get a strong powerful so feel free

132
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:50,410
to ask good questions you get extra

133
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:53,470
powerful so most common network

134
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,290
connections are IP as also the

135
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,060
developers from devices which are not

136
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,380
meant to be openly connected are lazy

137
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:08,920
they mainly use IP mostly they use TCP

138
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:12,610
and encryption is optional more on

139
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,770
encryption later and as it's mainly

140
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,320
network connected if it's mainly network

141
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,780
connected there's mostly software from

142
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,400
the supplier available which might not

143
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:26,020
help you to do it what you want to do

144
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:29,610
but we come back on that layer if it's

145
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:33,040
serial there are there are three options

146
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:35,320
what I encounter in the field its rs-232

147
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,349
you know that as the serial

148
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,560
there's TTL if you ever played with a

149
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,200
Raspberry Pi and connected the wrong TTL

150
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,640
to use B converter and you blow a blew

151
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,130
up your Raspberry Pi you know the

152
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,130
difference between 3.3 and 5 volts and

153
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:58,540
there's also rs-485 that looks like

154
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,400
serial when you start measuring it and

155
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,469
when you connect it and then when you

156
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,860
try to send it back it starts to behave

157
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,860
strangely

158
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:15,180
it's basically a differential which

159
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:17,370
means that on one of the wires you set

160
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,430
the negative voltage and all the only

161
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,160
ones are positive so together if you ask

162
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:25,290
add them together is zero so you can do

163
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,430
it over very long cables as it's not

164
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,500
distorted by any other signals you have

165
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:36,300
a full duplex and a half duplex variant

166
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:40,500
because standards are made for more

167
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:43,410
standards there's an xkcd on that the

168
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,920
logic analyzer might hate you because it

169
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,660
goes to a negative voltage and your your

170
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,610
also the scope if you put it in default

171
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,899
settings it shows a zero line and then

172
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:57,570
it goes below the zero line that are a

173
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,970
bit giveaways that that's happening that

174
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:04,110
you might look into that as a protocol

175
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,740
if you encountered that you have

176
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:11,100
parallel parallel are multiple

177
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,040
connections at the same times if you see

178
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:17,490
it if it's not scusi it's mainly 8-bit

179
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:21,089
wide and sometimes four bits in in all

180
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:23,250
the devices it can be unidirectional

181
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:27,740
which means it's going only from one

182
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:30,959
side to the other or bi-directional and

183
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,620
half and full duplex it's it's basically

184
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,739
a mess

185
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,720
but as this is very much more difficult

186
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,339
to implement takes more wires you

187
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,010
wouldn't encounter this as much in the

188
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:46,589
real world and all connections you see

189
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,870
it sometimes written yes connected by an

190
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,720
analog cable or something what I mean is

191
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,730
it's the pills

192
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,230
mostly it's isolated connections so

193
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,880
there's an opto coupler on the other end

194
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,620
or you can connect it with an opto

195
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,570
coupler and it's one signal per wire and

196
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,880
if you connect two wires the door will

197
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:12,170
open for example or the magnet will

198
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:14,750
close and so that's what you didn't see

199
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,510
and then we have wireless wireless is

200
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,810
what they all promises to solve every

201
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:25,330
problem of a wire so they just take the

202
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,329
protocols of the wires and then add more

203
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,990
complexity you have Wi-Fi that that's

204
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,319
just like network only without a cable

205
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,050
you have bluetooth most bluetooth

206
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,460
implementations are a serial connection

207
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:46,939
over bluetooth they're sick be it does

208
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:51,500
exist I heard I haven't seen it in much

209
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:55,940
other devices than light bulbs and some

210
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,190
power meters and then there's the older

211
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,920
forty three and eight six eight

212
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,570
megahertz and you know that from the

213
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:08,870
crickets for garage doors or your car

214
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:13,550
older cars or the click on click off

215
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:18,440
light switches for those the last two

216
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:20,209
you can just buy a USB 2 to that

217
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:26,150
frequency board and you can start

218
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:30,140
sniffing and sending the same data then

219
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:33,160
we have connectors connectors are dead

220
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,330
because they are all standardized and

221
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,079
everyone would be invents the device

222
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:43,040
creates a new standard I've seen them

223
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:46,520
doing power over network cables using

224
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,880
serial data for just serial connection

225
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:54,530
which is correctly and true only why

226
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,570
that connector so never assumed that

227
00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:00,079
I'll look like a serial port on my

228
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,970
computer it might be serial that's a

229
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,040
dangerous assumption because sometimes

230
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:08,810
they put 240 volts over those cables

231
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,319
which is very very bad if you

232
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,869
encountered that please try to change it

233
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,970
because the connector and the wires are

234
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,970
really not rated for such high voltages

235
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,110
about wires and power and cables if you

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,560
the thick cables

237
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,709
in the device it mainly means lots of

238
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,229
power if you see fairly thin cables it

239
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:39,479
mainly means low voltage but measure it

240
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:42,019
if you don't measure it and assume then

241
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,430
yeah you're gambling and it will break

242
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:46,440
if you have thick cables and high

243
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,420
voltage and you touch it you break if

244
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,310
you have thin wires and the low folders

245
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,899
and you touch it wrongly equipment

246
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,949
breaks so be very careful not to touch

247
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,010
devices if you don't know what's

248
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,560
happening with your bare hands

249
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:05,459
also make sure you have our ground fault

250
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:09,599
interrupter ground fault interrupters

251
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:12,419
save lives a lot especially if you're

252
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:16,049
opening machines and start working on

253
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:21,990
wires or if you by accident don't

254
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:24,599
connect the ground wire or and yes

255
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,049
switching on and off the devices is time

256
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:31,949
consuming you can make a remote switch

257
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:35,549
work by a power switch with the remote

258
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:37,620
or make something to switch it off when

259
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:42,600
you think I need to reconnect the power

260
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:46,678
wires make sure it's off if you have

261
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,840
your amp or your multimeter in a

262
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,080
measuring mode and you connect it to a

263
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,520
power voltage you basically create a

264
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:00,570
sort sorta stand your intro your fuse

265
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,418
will interrupt and blow and also on

266
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,200
those devices there's always a little

267
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:10,530
test switch on your circuit breakers

268
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:14,610
press them test them because they might

269
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:16,320
get broken down over time and then at

270
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,750
the right moment they will not save your

271
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:24,840
life yeah sometimes you encounter

272
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:29,280
connectors this is a very specific power

273
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:32,040
cable which has two male parts I don't

274
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,220
know who made it or that ended up in how

275
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,870
a heck of space and it's really really

276
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,000
because on those bins you see

277
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,649
very handy sticking out and you can lick

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,140
them there is 230 volts there's also a

279
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:55,880
warning behind the power socket there's

280
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:59,060
a chance of 230 volts yes that's that's

281
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,860
2 mil else I didn't make it it ends up

282
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:04,000
because somebody found it in a box of

283
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,000
power cables at event

284
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,460
some Chinese laser cutters cope with it

285
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,520
thank you thank you

286
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:30,890
[Applause]

287
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:33,710
so connectors yeah you have to db9 re 45

288
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,470
which is not re 45 but everybody calls

289
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,810
it that way pin Harris ITC molex and

290
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:43,000
none and I'll explain them in the next

291
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:47,860
slide a db9 connector you all know as

292
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,470
serial and it's actually called de 9

293
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,320
yeah might be ds9 but de 9 is the

294
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,090
standard everybody calls the db9

295
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,760
works.we now at the serial it can't

296
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:04,730
contain any signal and sometimes you

297
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:07,160
might actually encounter rs-232 these

298
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:11,960
connectors you know them as Network

299
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:15,410
telephone ISDN they might contain

300
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:21,320
network or telephone or ICN well I've

301
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:24,860
seen them used for free for all purposes

302
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:28,159
I've seen them to transport USB which is

303
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,860
very key because it drags but they're

304
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,410
actually barcode scanners that while you

305
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:39,770
plug in a special cable from disk a

306
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:46,280
connector to USB video yeah it's a way

307
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:47,160
you have a coax to RG 49 connector pin

308
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,649
Harris

309
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,200
bananas are these things they are just

310
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,570
taking out you have seen them on your

311
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,660
batch in on your batch there in the

312
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:00,090
female variety where these in the

313
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,090
picture are oval male it's very easy to

314
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,159
connect wires to them you can just work

315
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,379
them all nor stick them in and it's

316
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,620
mainly very unclear what they are for

317
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,840
inside the device because it has

318
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:18,620
something like connector one original it

319
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:22,470
and that's it you also have them in IDC

320
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,810
mainly used with flat cables those are

321
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,750
pin headers with a little bit of plastic

322
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:31,560
around them it's also the same it's easy

323
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,590
with cables it's mainly unclear what it

324
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,310
is however sometimes you see written

325
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:40,649
down think like jtech or our ISP or ICSP

326
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,830
and that means that it's the programming

327
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:47,580
port and that's very useful to start

328
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:52,639
debugging if you see these connectors

329
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:55,980
there are molex they mostly do power

330
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,580
they sometimes add a little bit bit of

331
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,240
data to some pins and sometimes they add

332
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,679
a little bit of power to some data lines

333
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,750
almost always there's power included

334
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,240
those connectors are made for power if

335
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:13,290
you have your computer they are in there

336
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,860
to distribute power so be aware that

337
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:20,820
there can be a lot of amps and voltages

338
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:25,139
behind him I have seen those connectors

339
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:30,870
used for for very high voltages they are

340
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:34,980
not made for them but yeah people make

341
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:38,459
them anyway and also you have connectors

342
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:43,950
with nothing you see here I wrote forgot

343
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:46,410
to translate test points um if you have

344
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,440
a PCB you might have some of these

345
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:53,250
little dots those are test points there

346
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,530
might be debug ports you can measure

347
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,580
them where they go to on the chip for

348
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,800
example look up this chip specification

349
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,659
find out what I do sometimes it's

350
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,240
written there as in this case of the

351
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,930
board and you can easily solve the wires

352
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:14,210
to them as they're just bare copper

353
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:18,620
exposed copper so for example if you

354
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,900
take a cheap Chinese router crappy

355
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,639
software thingy

356
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:27,140
it contains Network and it has a

357
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:31,010
wireless and a few megabytes of RAM open

358
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,590
wrt software is available and its

359
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,060
software lot so you cannot update your

360
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,750
own firmware normally you have to

361
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:42,710
exploit the device to do that or as in

362
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,840
this case open it up find out what

363
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,580
written on the internet and as you can

364
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,439
see there are two fairly small test

365
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:53,720
points here Rx and TX and on the other

366
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,050
side there is a ground and you sold out

367
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:00,380
three wires to them and if you solve

368
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:07,720
three wires to them very nice soldering

369
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:12,910
work then you can connect a USB to TTL

370
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:16,450
board you speed V to TTL boards are

371
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:20,720
basically making a serial signal on

372
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:24,920
three point three or five volts and you

373
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,290
need three wires to connect connect them

374
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,410
if you connect them you can put a

375
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:35,210
resistor in between the device and so it

376
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:37,520
it and TTL converter resistor safety

377
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,800
device they don't let so much power into

378
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,750
your device that it starts smoking and

379
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:46,220
the magic smokes escape and your device

380
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,810
doesn't work anymore never use the 5

381
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,090
volt supply on those things it comes

382
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:53,450
from USB from your computer for a crappy

383
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:56,030
converter and the device might not be

384
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,540
willing to accept it most devices have

385
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,830
their own power supply used at

386
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:05,300
connecting 3 wires there are there are

387
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:09,409
more connectors to it or connecting 3

388
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:12,260
wires is enough as its serial and it's

389
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:15,170
it has no knowledge of the others

390
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,240
it's receiving if you start copy-pasting

391
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:19,850
long strings of commands for it what to

392
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,120
do the buffer might be overwritten

393
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:26,260
because you're sending file a USB into

394
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:30,979
the 64 byte buffer of your converter and

395
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:34,129
when the 65 4 bytes are our app and

396
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,410
there are 0 remaining and isn't still

397
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:39,850
sending one of the other the further

398
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:42,290
earlier but you start overwriting the

399
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:48,110
Autobot you want to send so don't type

400
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:52,520
too fast so if you don't connect it you

401
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:55,909
can see it's talking over of a serial to

402
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,970
your computer and then you can just copy

403
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,680
paste what you found on the Internet and

404
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:03,200
then you have a better device because it

405
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:07,820
runnings from outsource Linux instead of

406
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:12,290
some Chinese locked down all the line

407
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,030
ups without security patches in this

408
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,040
case with this device there exploits

409
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,690
available on the internet so if you

410
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,960
encounter any of them in the world you

411
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:29,600
want to upgrade them as possible only do

412
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:32,750
that but devices you own so for serial

413
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,000
if you have a serial port and you want

414
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,830
to know how fast it's talking you can

415
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,170
measure it with your scope or your logic

416
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,780
analyzer but the first which is cope

417
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:44,180
just find out how long the smallest bit

418
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,639
is so when it changes from 0 to 1 or

419
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,340
from 1 to 0 how small the time is that

420
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,460
it was low or high and then type it into

421
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:57,879
Wolfram Alpha and then it tells you how

422
00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:00,440
fast it's about and then at some point I

423
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,860
should have a pointer huh now it's

424
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,320
hidden you see down there telling me 10

425
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,050
kilobytes a second which is fairly close

426
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,159
to 9600 which is one of the standard

427
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:16,669
serial speeds if you have a logic

428
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,560
analyzer just connected and let the

429
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,260
software do the rest just click on auto

430
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,750
discovery and out about right and it

431
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:27,520
tells you how fast it is and actually

432
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,520
also what bytes are there

433
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:41,510
if you if you have a if you have a logic

434
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,580
analyzer and mainly the logic analyzer

435
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,320
has a ground in what you connect to the

436
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,090
ground of the device and you also

437
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:54,020
connect them to the data pins of the

438
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:57,199
device and which is zero to use be don't

439
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:02,810
know it can have a different ground yeah

440
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,610
but you could use is be isolator or you

441
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:10,490
could use a laptop and not connect it to

442
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:12,949
the power supply because if you don't

443
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:18,290
connect your you did it for they're so

444
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:19,970
powerful right now if you connect is

445
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,830
right if you connect something to a

446
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,330
power source and then you connect

447
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,070
computer also and the computer has a

448
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,310
different power source there might be

449
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,110
different in the the ground in the 0 but

450
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:33,290
if you don't you're gonna connect your

451
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:37,580
computer to a power source and use the

452
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:40,670
battery then the ground is the ground

453
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:45,649
whatever it is because there's nothing

454
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:50,080
else that's pulling it to the earth so

455
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,080
say if your laptop use your battery so

456
00:28:51,640 --> 00:29:03,890
in bits per byte if you do serial it's 8

457
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:07,970
most always well I've seen seven six and

458
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:11,690
five and I also have seen nine nine is

459
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:15,190
bad because Linus cannot do natively

460
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:18,590
nine bits in serial

461
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:22,490
there are parity bits in serial nobody

462
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:30,560
uses them anymore that just ignore them

463
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:32,980
it's basically it's 98 608 and nothing

464
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,980
it's

465
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,370
it's an all the concept that your serial

466
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,680
cables should have some integrity

467
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:46,909
it's these days mainly built into the

468
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:49,880
protocol where they do checksums about

469
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:52,340
protocols they're their binary and text

470
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,410
protocols the texts are very easy

471
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,199
readable because yeah it's text

472
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,210
it's like mail service where you can

473
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,370
actually type hallo and a domain name

474
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,010
and you get a decade's also works on

475
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:07,459
serial protocol there also by any binary

476
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,980
protocols they're way more logical

477
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:15,200
there's there's things like checksums

478
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:17,900
built-in and they're their start and end

479
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,960
markers and you can see if a sentence is

480
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:25,190
correct and with text that's mainly not

481
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,679
built in inside the S key table on the

482
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:31,850
very start of the S key table there are

483
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:34,660
some start of text end of text start end

484
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,659
of sentence

485
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:41,540
defined if you see a binary protocol

486
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:45,290
mainly those are used for separating a

487
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:48,220
message or parts of the message and also

488
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:51,440
the checksum is always on the end

489
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,270
because it's easier to just send data

490
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,300
and then calculate on what you sent

491
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:59,090
outside then pre calculate what to check

492
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,490
so might be and start with that so if

493
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,629
you see some random bytes at the end I

494
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:06,380
think that's strange

495
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:10,370
yeah that's your checksum if it's serial

496
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:14,360
and its text then just type help or the

497
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:17,149
question mark or don't sniff between

498
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,990
what it does yeah I said text is very

499
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:22,610
easily readable but there's really no

500
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,710
standard in knowing what to sense

501
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,149
because you have to exactly know what

502
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:34,490
you're the developer thought while

503
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:38,929
typing for for post devices we attack

504
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:41,360
for two we have a Wooten burner and we

505
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:43,400
connected it to the the building but

506
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,610
we're not always there and we want to

507
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,220
have it warm whenever we go there or and

508
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,729
and yeah close it down where we don't

509
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,250
need

510
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:53,029
to save the environment bit burning wood

511
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,029
is co3

512
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:58,789
to neutral and things like that but we

513
00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:00,970
don't pay for it but still we try to be

514
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:00,970
nice

515
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:09,230
those devices are very easy to measure a

516
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:11,539
very easy to test they can make sounds

517
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:15,769
like a roaring motor or you hear we

518
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,929
really click there's almost never a line

519
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,909
that gives you feedback that oh yeah I

520
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:24,320
have opened this relay or something like

521
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:26,029
that because it's yeah it's mainly all

522
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,970
the technology what you encounter when

523
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:34,460
you do this the things like climbing if

524
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:37,370
you open the gate then you just measure

525
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,779
it and then open it one and a half times

526
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,029
that long and then you know for sure

527
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:44,419
it's open and if you want to know it's

528
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:54,919
closed and you send close again for how

529
00:32:44,419 --> 00:33:00,529
long it takes so then you have things

530
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:05,799
like more modern Bluetooth you know

531
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:10,220
maybe have seen corridors to plug in or

532
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:12,260
all the devices which for example dildos

533
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:16,389
or so that's connect to your phone and

534
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,389
then over the internet via an app

535
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,950
they're very they're mostly serial to

536
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,690
two Bluetooth converters because

537
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,960
developers are lazy as serial to

538
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,549
Bluetooth converters are very cheap

539
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,559
sometimes they are not about as

540
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:36,529
Bluetooth devices these days they all

541
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:40,010
come with an app and you can decompile

542
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:43,309
the app and then you can very easy learn

543
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:48,730
from it mainly they're written in some

544
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:51,440
form of Java or some web app format and

545
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,909
encryption on Bluetooth devices is hard

546
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,460
so nobody does it

547
00:33:52,909 --> 00:34:01,340
okay so encryption is mostly hard Keys

548
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,610
coded somewhere in the software or

549
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,709
delivered from

550
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:09,040
the device MAC address or things like

551
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:13,199
that if you have vendor software like

552
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:17,469
those apks for Android or offer

553
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:19,750
windows.net software it's very nice

554
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:23,668
because it's very very good decompile

555
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:26,349
able with jetbrains dot peak decompiler

556
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:28,540
so you can see exactly how they

557
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:32,889
calculate checksums what key they use

558
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:35,469
what methods they have to verify what

559
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,179
commands they send and if they compiled

560
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:41,109
it in a nice way you get all their

561
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:44,290
symbol names so you know what what every

562
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:48,810
variable means for Android you can

563
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:55,210
download apk extracted and decompile it

564
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:58,150
as a Java if it's decompiled it's mainly

565
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,220
without debugging symbols but as I've

566
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,980
encountered somewhere on the internet

567
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,319
sometimes they not only attacked a

568
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,080
compiled Java dot class files was also

569
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,490
the source drop Java files which is very

570
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:14,020
efficient because then you don't have to

571
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:15,549
decompile it an iOS it's mostly not

572
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,720
needed because vendors want to make

573
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:23,140
their hardware work with all phones and

574
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:27,368
Android is the most used platform in the

575
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:30,549
world so I have never decomposed an iOS

576
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:33,910
app till now it was not needed to make

577
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,800
something work if you have further

578
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,529
software and you want to decompile it

579
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,190
you can first ask definitely how's your

580
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:44,140
protocol working and can I do that and

581
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,150
then they can say things like sort of

582
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,540
you need to buy a license to have that

583
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:52,050
functionality ok you didn't want to tell

584
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,310
me how the protocol works so now I make

585
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,300
reverse-engineer it according to

586
00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:00,460
European law so first ask nicely then

587
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:05,080
get rejected and then you're okay to do

588
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:08,770
whatever you want to do if endless

589
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,710
built-in encryption almost none do it

590
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,580
correct it's a they have an invented

591
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,250
here syndrome

592
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:19,279
it's mostly not real encryption they

593
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:22,750
they copy-paste some stuff from stack of

594
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,850
chains and put it in their code

595
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:30,620
hard-coded keys hard-coded

596
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:34,759
initialization factors for AES and all

597
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:38,089
that stuff if that's not really working

598
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,040
and you want to doom some more data get

599
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,890
an over Android version in your emulator

600
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,900
most vendors try to make a software work

601
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,480
with the older Android and the other

602
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,420
Edwards are way more open for you to

603
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,760
debug and the memory and they don't have

604
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,760
this modern encryption stuff so good

605
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:04,130
build in so it doesn't hurt you while

606
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:07,190
debugging for wireless tools yeah the

607
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:11,780
four three three eight six x megahertz

608
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:15,080
you can very easily sniff replay it you

609
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:17,030
can use new radio which is awesome

610
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,509
software but Union really need to study

611
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:24,860
it and you need really need to have a

612
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:28,850
study about radios and FFTs and to

613
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:31,370
understand what this software does but

614
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:33,860
there's also software where you can just

615
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:36,230
press record and play and do a replay

616
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,830
attack it might work if it works you

617
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:42,800
know what they're sending if you

618
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:46,130
encounter American software hardware

619
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,700
they are on a different frequency you

620
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,700
have a question

621
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:09,060
yes yeah yeah he gets travel repeated

622
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:12,450
for the stream you can buy some very

623
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,730
cheap for for three megahertz Sanders

624
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:17,399
receivers connect them to your Raspberry

625
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,650
Pi Wireless or your laptop a serial or

626
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,200
your laptop serial and then dump the

627
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,610
data and replay it so you get a stop

628
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,999
Apple

629
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,999
[Applause]

630
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:35,960
yeah but software-defined radios are way

631
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:38,550
more entertaining than just some text

632
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,330
because if you connect such a receiver

633
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:44,130
yet just another serial protocol same

634
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,410
works with Bluetooth if you can pair to

635
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:49,290
it with a Bluetooth receiver and it ends

636
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:51,620
up being a serial protocol its serial

637
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,620
again

638
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:58,950
there are also some clone devices so if

639
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,860
you're really lazy and don't want to

640
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:04,410
even watch to a computer screen you just

641
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,170
double click on aliexpress right could

642
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:13,140
be my car keys or my garage key device

643
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:16,700
and it does it then there are offenders

644
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:21,509
who always want you to firmware update

645
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:24,000
don't do that if you want to have a

646
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,250
device do something else don't update

647
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,200
their firmware especially not if they

648
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,360
know what you're doing because mainly

649
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,470
firmware updates means we're locking it

650
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,660
down so try to downgrade firmware with

651
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:39,890
less security and more known exploits to

652
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,890
make it do what you want

653
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:47,700
they've tools you have to run them on

654
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:49,680
Windows and ya have Windows somewhere

655
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,189
available in a virtual machine to be

656
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,250
able to do that because I've tried a lot

657
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:59,970
of firmware updates running on wine in

658
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,920
Linux or things like that sometimes it

659
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,069
works but mainly it's just a pain in the

660
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,070
ass

661
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,299
yeah that's correct you can monitor if

662
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:20,880
you run Windows and if you have a new

663
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:24,089
firmware updates you can monitor the USB

664
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,130
what is sending over USB which virtual

665
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:28,799
machine software or you can sniff to

666
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,039
wireless and then yeah you can make your

667
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:34,589
own firmware updater sometimes then it's

668
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,299
handy to also reverse engineer the

669
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:49,920
firmware update or when it's doing some

670
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:51,859
encryption you get a strop Apple so

671
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,430
let's see how many slides I have left

672
00:40:51,859 --> 00:41:00,959
seven firmware drawn grades yes as I

673
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:04,859
said less encryption more known update

674
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:09,049
mechanisms or exploits if you get

675
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:12,269
firmware you can try starting bin woke

676
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:14,489
extract and with DD and the Linux you

677
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,098
strings and a hex editor and to look at

678
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:19,229
what is it is it the file system then

679
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:24,390
mount a file system or things like that

680
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:27,509
and try to build your own software if

681
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:31,469
you do some programming basically use

682
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:33,539
parts and use Arduino why is it your

683
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:36,089
favorite language a little bit

684
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:38,729
it's Arduino your favorite platform no

685
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:40,979
but there's a lot available and there's

686
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:43,379
a lot of copy/paste code available for

687
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:45,448
different devices to connect it so you

688
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,549
can start with it and once you know

689
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:52,799
exactly what you do you can upgrade to

690
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:56,420
some other hardware yeah adrenals are

691
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:58,829
really cheap these days to replace

692
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:03,059
there's some trial and error there are

693
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:05,910
some fuzzing for Python I said it's

694
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:09,209
really easy and you can just copy paste

695
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:11,098
from Stack Overflow I'm lazy and I said

696
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:12,808
other people help me even if they don't

697
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:18,050
know what that are helping me it's very

698
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:20,869
nice of them for Arduino it's very good

699
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,910
the hardware is very known there's a lot

700
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:25,820
of people who already collected a lot of

701
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,319
all the sensors and did things wrong so

702
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:32,570
you can just copy paste our code from

703
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:36,619
Stack Overflow if you go further if you

704
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:39,320
find logic in bytes then and you see the

705
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:41,540
checksums then you can make your own

706
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,750
messages and you can start sending a

707
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,180
strange message to device sometimes this

708
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,490
message means reset and clear all your

709
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:51,710
memory and everything you know and then

710
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:54,279
there's no way to firmware update

711
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,900
anymore so always have a spare device

712
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:01,880
don't retest your software on the spare

713
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:04,730
device to be nabbed on that sometimes

714
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,580
their error codes but most developers

715
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:10,840
don't write error handling they just go

716
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:22,310
if it's an error then everything feels

717
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:23,930
because if you yeah if you momentarily

718
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,940
break it but sometimes you completely

719
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:28,730
break it when when you're starting

720
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,790
fizzing because there's some factory

721
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:36,440
reset - we need a new programming hammer

722
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:38,630
on it so I've seen that and sometimes

723
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,460
you just try sending completely other

724
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,339
commands and then you see that it has

725
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,200
also not only one communication mode but

726
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:47,660
also completely different for the call

727
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,700
when you start sending always in the

728
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:53,270
beginning let's start to switch to text

729
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:56,480
or something like that how do I start

730
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:59,660
now think of a new problem just make one

731
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,630
ask for some help then then you'll know

732
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:06,348
a little bit around and never throw your

733
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:09,260
files away because yeah I have a dump of

734
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:11,810
this protocol somewhere oh no I cleaned

735
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,599
up every day now don't don't have a

736
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:20,540
clean desk policy on on your work

737
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:23,390
directory um so I hope everything is

738
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,310
unclear now then I have my mission

739
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,230
accomplished

740
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:31,009
does anybody want to gain a Stoffel with

741
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:37,280
a decent question anyone questions

742
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:40,540
a comenzar also ya know then I gained

743
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:49,450
more knowledge let's see if we reward it

744
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:49,450
probably yes yes yes

745
00:44:51,280 --> 00:45:03,859
somebody has something I have a router a

746
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:07,160
with Lorraine TV via TSE yes and instead

747
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:09,590
of taking the old version of TV BRT

748
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,160
tested for the device I took a new

749
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:16,250
version from the FTP server and I

750
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,160
pricked the device are you wondering how

751
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,830
to unbreak it yeah yeah but I brought

752
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:28,790
this ccl2 USB adapter

753
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:31,940
yes but sadly I typed some wrong numbers

754
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:35,119
when trying to connect so now I need a

755
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,430
que attack to recover it

756
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,740
yeah I didn't bring any hardware from

757
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:43,310
the Netherlands to here to do this okay

758
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:45,549
but yeah yes but as you see you play the

759
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:48,410
device if you do something wrong yes

760
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:53,690
bricked it yeah if somebody here has a

761
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:57,950
jtech program my header okay okay thank

762
00:45:53,690 --> 00:46:00,950
you thank you so you get so powerful and

763
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:03,350
he gets a so powerful good

764
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,189
I love this stuff with positive

765
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:08,509
reinforcement

766
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:09,200
it works on Montague attendees it works

767
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,840
on kids

768
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,540
it works on dogs it works imposes and it

769
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,850
works and presenters as well

770
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:19,940
yeah any more questions

771
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:24,618
[Applause]

772
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:27,900
yes have you ever been able to set up a

773
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:30,779
machine monsters of weird things that

774
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,099
you have hacked again access to to make

775
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:37,589
your own automated everyday script

776
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:40,440
paradise wonderland like the russian guy

777
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:43,019
who got he scripted everything in this

778
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:47,789
life did did I stripped and and hacked

779
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:49,220
my my way around my life now I'm too

780
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:52,349
lazy to do that

781
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,839
hack 42 kinda is if you open the space

782
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:56,910
stage everything goes on if you close it

783
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,578
down the pinball machine goes off but

784
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:02,700
not automatically on when you enter the

785
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:07,349
lysis fridge turn off when you close it

786
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:13,740
so we automated a lot there to to ease

787
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:15,839
our life how would you analyze say 5

788
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,819
gigahertz wireless transmitter a

789
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,460
transmission I can't get a hold of the

790
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:23,819
documentation for the communication how

791
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:27,569
would I analyze that I would basically

792
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:29,880
take take a more professional network

793
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:33,589
device which might contain network

794
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,910
debugging port or some better software I

795
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:37,650
wouldn't know which brands but I would

796
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:40,259
take something like that and then start

797
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:43,710
analyzing what I did because the more

798
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:45,119
professional hardware is mainly better

799
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,950
test that which means they have more

800
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,720
test points and programming heroes on

801
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:53,180
there PCBs they have firmware updates

802
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:55,950
and and things like but 5 gigahertz is

803
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:58,410
pretty fast so it's more difficult so

804
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:03,799
you need to buy better hardware to do

805
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:08,899
that ok thanks anyone else

806
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:11,630
yeah yeah I'm coming with 12 apples know

807
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,610
if that was the last of the questions it

808
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,500
was the last one I have strop hours left

809
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:20,350
but come to me afterwards so you get

810
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:23,960
well have you ever played about with

811
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:28,250
using the VGA port on your laptop as an

812
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:30,260
I squared C debugging tool if I've ever

813
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:35,810
used to Fiji a port on my laptop as I

814
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:38,300
square no because I have Arduino and and

815
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:41,240
all the stuff like logic analyzer so I

816
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:46,940
don't need to connect and my laptop is

817
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:51,709
modern it has no Fiji a well let's give

818
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:55,400
Buckner a big head so thank you very

819
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:57,820
much and I see you around I'll be here

820
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,820
all week
