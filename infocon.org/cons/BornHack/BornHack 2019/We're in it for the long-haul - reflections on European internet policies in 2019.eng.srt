1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,160
it's just

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,960
okay

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:25,460
we're going to have our first keynote at

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:27,229
this year's porn hack 2019 it's a

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,689
well-known guest we've had her before

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,610
here it's Amelia Anna's daughter who is

7
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,129
going to give the talk when the long

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,830
haul reflections on European internet

9
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:45,050
policies in 2019 give a big round of

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:46,910
applause to Amelia so greetings and

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,250
salutations it's such an honor to be

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,078
here thank you for being so many people

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,809
in the audience tonight my name is

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,239
Amelia understand for the past 13 years

15
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:57,440
I've been working on digital rights in

16
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,169
various capacities

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,449
I started out caring about copyright and

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,250
surveillance issues heat the debates and

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,380
the Swedish society some of which will

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,740
be remembered by people who were old

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:13,789
enough in 2005 to 2009 all the way back

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,860
in 2006 I also served as a member of the

23
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:18,470
European Parliament on behalf of the

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:23,090
Swedish Pirate Party between 2011 and

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:25,580
2014 since 2015 I run a Swedish NGO

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,100
called dotnet that tries to assist the

27
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,020
government with the implementation of

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,059
digital European legislation general

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,280
data protection regulation in Sweden

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,619
locally and for the past couple of years

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,439
I have had the big fortune of working

32
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,360
with uk-based nongovernmental

33
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,220
organization article 19 and their

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,250
program to assess the impact of

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,220
technical design choices in technical

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,049
standards organizations and how to

37
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,759
enable individuals to use their

38
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,390
connector technologies to exercise their

39
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,009
human rights to disclose some more on my

40
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,360
background in just the case anyone is

41
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,770
interested I have a Bachelor in

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,320
mathematics and I also wrote The

43
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,908
Bachelor thesis on business law oriented

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,470
towards competition and antitrust in the

45
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,410
telecommunications sector more

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,910
specifically net neutrality I'm enrolled

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,090
in a master's course at Uppsala

48
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,640
University that is slowly progressing

49
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,420
since 2017 and it's going somewhere

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,339
young this speech was originally

51
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,000
proposed for an event in Norway that

52
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,590
never happened but I was asked earlier

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,580
this year to share some of my thoughts

54
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,560
in the state

55
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,220
information policy today so I've tried

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,290
to recycle it for your benefit here and

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,180
I hope that it will be relevant so

58
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,910
information policy is a very broad field

59
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,800
it encompasses many things from

60
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,600
innovation policy to human rights and

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,300
democracy also public secretary

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,269
technologies but I will try to narrow it

63
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,330
down to some examples that I believe

64
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,550
contextualise really important issues

65
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,100
for our contemporary European societies

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,500
today I also want to quickly make the

67
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,299
caveat that I am NOT an expert on

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,220
domestic danishes issues so I will not

69
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,420
have so many local relevant examples

70
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:13,220
from here also most of my contemporary

71
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,649
examples will somehow naturally come

72
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,910
from Swedish law because this is where

73
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,300
I've been operating for the past couple

74
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:23,600
of years so therefore should you find me

75
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,600
Sweden or EU centric those are the

76
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,420
reasons it's simply from where I am

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,760
where I'm based I should also clarify

78
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,738
that I am speaking on behalf of myself

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,570
today and not on behalf of any of the

80
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,010
organization for which any of the

81
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,320
organizations for which I'm currently

82
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,459
working these are just some of the

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,829
accumulated reasonings that I make based

84
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,950
on my experience over the past decade or

85
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:52,690
so I was also planning to cover three

86
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:55,429
different topics I have no slides

87
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,320
because I hope that I could get away

88
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,410
with not doing them I will cover three

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,090
separate topics today that for some of

90
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,910
you will feel like they're quite old but

91
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,560
I will justify this perspective so

92
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,090
firstly I want to cover national

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,720
security and its relation to the

94
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,880
Internet in broad terms secondly I want

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,160
to cover public institutions and their

96
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,350
struggle with best nuts and computers

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,810
and connections and the way in which

98
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,880
this almost religious approach to

99
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,270
computers and efficiencies is not

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,979
actually very useful lastly I want to

101
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,390
return to a topic that some of you may

102
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:31,039
have followed in the spring which is

103
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,990
copyright it's an issue I believe

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,570
continues to be relevant for internet

105
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,680
discussions and that has a big impact on

106
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,840
how our technologies are shaped so in

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,420
information policy of course new topics

108
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,119
also crop

109
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,100
by the day we have new surveillance laws

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,550
new interesting means for law

111
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,680
enforcement or companies to encroach on

112
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,140
individual freedoms and rights we have

113
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,810
new corporate rights aiming to foreclose

114
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:01,950
competition or restrict individuals and

115
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,930
so forth we are living in the time where

116
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,240
governments and companies are becoming

117
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,190
increasingly more powerful while

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,820
individuals are becoming increasingly

119
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,770
less powerful for a short while around

120
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,420
the Snowden revelations there were

121
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,729
discussions around this like serious

122
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,100
global discussions I find the reflection

123
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,660
of Barton Gellman an American

124
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,660
journalists who cover who covered the

125
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,750
Snowden leaks particularly fitting it is

126
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,760
as if we are behind a one-way mirror

127
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,500
where we as citizens and consumers are

128
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,960
increasingly more transparent to

129
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:39,210
companies who are increasingly more

130
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,630
opaque to us good news are a few they're

131
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,739
far between and to add insult to injury

132
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,560
governments all over the world are now

133
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,780
also beating the cyber war drums your

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,060
ruther which just yesterday was the

135
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,580
consumer security disaster by virtue of

136
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,900
the poor procurement practices a

137
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,990
telecommunications operators and the

138
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,010
lack of oversight is now a war zone

139
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,440
effectively limiting the government's

140
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,349
sense of urgency in applying even the

141
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,590
few norms that were already in place

142
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:09,540
this is a real issue meanwhile human

143
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,669
rights courts are increasingly bugging

144
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,850
themselves down in state perspectives

145
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,070
rather than individual perspectives at

146
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,710
the end of the day as a society we have

147
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:22,530
not advanced very far beyond the

148
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,840
Westphalian model the European Union

149
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,789
which started out as a brilliant post

150
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,369
modernist experience of having States

151
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,230
compromise and negotiate rather than

152
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,840
colonial II pushing their views and one

153
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,010
another in a contest for power is also

154
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,260
increasingly modernist

155
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,539
we see it not in the least in the

156
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,640
adoption of a stale French proposal to

157
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,200
promote European prominence by

158
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,570
introducing heavy regulatory

159
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,640
requirements on US web services in

160
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,099
copyright law in contradiction with what

161
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,469
most successful web businesses few of

162
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,320
which by the way our French would argue

163
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:59,090
Europe needs these are long term trends

164
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,360
the remodel ization of state to state

165
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:05,419
relations and state to citizen relations

166
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,340
they return to a worldview where loyalty

167
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,260
to king and country goes first and

168
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,820
loyalty with the individual citizen or

169
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,700
the private businesses always comes

170
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,980
second and on the Internet

171
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,599
the disastrous consequence that using

172
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,620
the Internet as a battlefield implies

173
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,200
that each of us

174
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,820
however unknowingly are caught in the

175
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,400
crossfire

176
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,200
anytime we strike our keyboards the

177
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,900
European Union faces some interesting

178
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,039
challenges in this respect in the past

179
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,049
four years alone

180
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,960
the European Union has produced not one

181
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,580
but two new laws aiming at harmonizing

182
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,280
Network and information security rules

183
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,630
around the EU the reason for this is of

184
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,969
course that most information and

185
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,570
communication technologies are developed

186
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,190
by and distributed by private sector

187
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,170
companies to consumers who are either

188
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,590
individuals public sector institutions

189
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,330
or other private sector companies think

190
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,580
about a Wi-Fi access point set up at the

191
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,130
kindergarten or a printer installed at

192
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,560
some local office for instance for most

193
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,240
of these produced for most of these

194
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,730
producers and consumers of information

195
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,610
and communication technologies being in

196
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,350
a war zone is inconvenient it limits

197
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,660
their choices makes the products

198
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,940
available more expensive and it risks

199
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,500
reducing the quality of service by

200
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,350
adding restrictions imposed from

201
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,090
national requirements the European Union

202
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,220
is trying to fix this problem by

203
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,320
ensuring that any security motivated

204
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,120
nationalist and protectionist measures

205
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,479
are at least harmonious in the European

206
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,490
trade area but EU member states in

207
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,080
general are not stupid and they

208
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,120
recognize when somebody is trying to

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,400
integrate competencies that they

210
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,210
consider core to their identities in a

211
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,530
global world just into a market space so

212
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,960
the first European attempt at

213
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,250
harmonization of this very important

214
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,400
field of network and information

215
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,320
security was the NIST directive of 2015

216
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,569
some of you may even be professionally

217
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,970
involved in in implementing it

218
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,430
it was watered down to the point of

219
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,100
being basically useless the only hard

220
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,750
requirement in the European text is for

221
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,150
breach notifications to go to some

222
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,150
public authority and land in an archive

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,600
it's the third European act at that

224
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,280
which requires some form of breach

225
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,440
notifications the others being the e

226
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,000
privacy directive of 2009 and the

227
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,810
general data protection regulation of

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,210
2016 and only the he privacy directive

229
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,130
of 2009 recognizes that breach

230
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,350
notifications that tell about when a

231
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,240
company has screwed up with customer

232
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:37,100
data may be of interest to the customer

233
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,740
all the other loss at the European level

234
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,510
put first and foremost the interest of

235
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,040
public authorities to gather large

236
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,590
amounts of breach notifications

237
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,530
presumably in some archive

238
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,940
I was recently alerted to how the

239
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,770
implementation of the network and

240
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,100
Information Security directive in Sweden

241
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,170
was extremely poor almost two years

242
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,060
after the entry into a fact of the

243
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,640
Swedish implementation of the net of the

244
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,400
NIST directive many organizations still

245
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,520
don't know if they're covered or if they

246
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,689
need to care about this legislation I

247
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,240
feel vindicated by this knowledge

248
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,830
because already in 2015 it was obvious

249
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,320
that the Swedish government had speedily

250
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,860
acted to produce its own local news law

251
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,510
to compete with the European framework

252
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,370
the Swedish homebrew legislation takes a

253
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,890
national security perspective which is

254
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,870
not at all adapted for market norms and

255
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,410
is not taken to consider consumers or

256
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:34,520
individuals at all and it doesn't

257
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:37,250
concern but it's also not in the nature

258
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,560
of government security apparatus to take

259
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,780
those considerations I had predicted

260
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,969
that these frameworks would compete and

261
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,040
that market actors if they were wise

262
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,350
would recognize that the nationalist air

263
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,760
of national security laws is much

264
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,000
stronger than the consumer oriented

265
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,800
approach of the European Union and that

266
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,150
therefore by doing risk management you

267
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,729
would choose to follow the national

268
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:02,150
security legislation so the local

269
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,220
homebrew one the European Commission in

270
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,780
addition must have felt immediately that

271
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,110
an is directive wasn't going to work

272
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,990
because they acted even in 2016 to

273
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,450
create a cybersecurity regulation which

274
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,220
by virtue of being a regulation becomes

275
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,890
immediately applicable in all the Member

276
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,180
States so no sooner than everyone had

277
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,980
put their pants down there was a

278
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,959
directive in place Member States that

279
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,899
implemented it

280
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:28,518
the European Parliament and the member

281
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:32,059
states were already back into

282
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,739
negotiations about yet another law and

283
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:37,339
now the European Union has a system for

284
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:39,289
adopting cybersecurity standards but my

285
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,269
point is I guess that the speed at which

286
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:43,189
these new initiatives are launched and

287
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,639
the speed at which were passing new laws

288
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:49,189
at the scale of the European Union is in

289
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,519
itself an indication of the failure of

290
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:54,199
the cybersecurity state in Europe the

291
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,119
fact of the matter is that Member States

292
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:58,459
in general are not willing to give up

293
00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:00,319
national security competencies and this

294
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,118
is harming the inner market and the

295
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:05,238
European Union is not being able to do

296
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:07,189
much about it it is still expected of

297
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:09,169
all of us that we accept that we are

298
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:10,759
treated worse by our governments and

299
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:13,009
worse by our companies and service

300
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,289
providers because we are expected to

301
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:17,779
have this grand idea of loyalty with the

302
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:20,809
antiquated idea of a modernist state

303
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,409
imposing itself on us and on our

304
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:25,339
neighbors

305
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:27,529
I find this field so fascinating because

306
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:30,199
it's really we're kind of in the

307
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,809
breaking point of history it feels like

308
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:34,699
to me as therefore at this cusp or we

309
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,809
can choose to be logged back into the

310
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:39,139
19th century

311
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:41,299
and nation state competition or rather

312
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,369
we advanced into the 21st century and we

313
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:45,079
just recognize that we can make good

314
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:48,499
productive economic legislation that

315
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,628
helps everyone for Europeans now more

316
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:53,509
than at any time we can actually choose

317
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:55,789
well I mean within some limits because

318
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,709
we are constrained by the particularly

319
00:12:55,789 --> 00:13:00,439
strong modernist traditions and some EU

320
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,598
member states but we can choose at least

321
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,629
in theory whether we believe that the

322
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:06,979
world is a competition between

323
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:10,999
civilizations or whether the world

324
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:12,859
itself is in fact a civilization let me

325
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,809
contextualise this with an example that

326
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,689
may seem trivial but I also find it very

327
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:21,379
encouraging and a bit acute so two years

328
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:23,389
ago I was working over summer as an

329
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:26,839
opinion editorial writer at the local

330
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:28,849
paper in the mid north of Sweden I came

331
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,069
across the Swedish village of gravel

332
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:34,999
come to the west of L of Dahl and

333
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:36,500
municipality bordering Norway and the

334
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:38,480
equally delightful village

335
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,270
gravel fun which I had the great

336
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,250
pleasure of visiting it's on the

337
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,260
Norwegian side of the border they just

338
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,090
have the same name I lived all alone for

339
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,370
context is one of the most sparsely

340
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,740
populated municipalities of Sweden it's

341
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,620
the 15th largest municipality has only

342
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,710
7,000 inhabitants so this is like really

343
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,120
rural and it's also really far like

344
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,570
north-northwest it's you can go skiing

345
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,110
there in the winter but surprisingly

346
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:08,000
these areas around Elif dalam and other

347
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,610
locations in that municipality like

348
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,710
sauna or edram which if you're skiers

349
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,950
you might recognize these names they are

350
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,090
exceptionally well-connected the burning

351
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,640
light of one man

352
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:22,910
former telecoms equipment developer on

353
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,980
the phreatic zone insured around 2010

354
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,500
that all the villages of the Swedish

355
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,750
side of the border of grabber gun would

356
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,960
make use of European funds to roll out

357
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,900
fiber optic cable village networks now

358
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,000
it now in gravel condon Sorek million

359
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,510
the lights are on and the connections

360
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,640
are 100 megabit symmetric I visited this

361
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:46,010
place and I must say there is something

362
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,380
very special about being in a place so

363
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,860
remote that you have no connection on

364
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,290
your 3G but the Wi-Fi password give you

365
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,850
the guest Wi-Fi password gives you

366
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,819
immediate access to high-speed high

367
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,740
quality connectivity the village

368
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,570
networks available in municipality and

369
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,100
there are 15 of them in turn created the

370
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,590
opportunity for Minister for the

371
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,370
municipal broadband coordinator to focus

372
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:13,250
on backhaul in many municipalities of

373
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,830
Sweden using fiber-optic rollout has

374
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,240
been achieved with city networks the

375
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,550
most prominent example of which is

376
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,890
through cab that operate both the

377
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,839
backhaul and last mile but al Dolan is

378
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:27,319
extremely geographically large as the

379
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,180
vast place so having all of the villages

380
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,760
make their own investments in their own

381
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,380
local infrastructure's allowed the

382
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,220
municipalities of the public

383
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,900
institutions to connect the villages

384
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,640
there are now the only municipality in

385
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,939
their region that is said to cover the

386
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,830
95 % broadband coverage targets that has

387
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,250
been set for 2020 it's a really

388
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,390
fantastic inspiring place but one of the

389
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,770
issues for this region on

390
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,720
infrastructure rollout let's say it's

391
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,220
very mountainous so building backhaul is

392
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,680
not only expensive because of the nature

393
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,510
of building backhaul it's also expensive

394
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,189
because the landscape doesn't lend

395
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:06,710
itself well to infrastructure deployment

396
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,570
I was informed that one of the ways in

397
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,430
which the Swedish village of gravel huh

398
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,960
you'd have cheaply solved their

399
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,989
interconnection with the rest of the

400
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,900
municipality was by taking a wire into

401
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,570
the Norwegian gravel con for about two

402
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,100
kilometers but that wasn't possible

403
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,400
because there's a border between

404
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,430
countries so they had to instead dig the

405
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,319
cable around 20 kilometers around the

406
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,310
mountain to get back to the main

407
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,760
backhaul Network hmm

408
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,650
so in Norway apparently it is the case

409
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,750
that they have these regions and then

410
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,370
they allocate them to operators for to

411
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,410
build infrastructure on so it's

412
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,030
difficult to reconcile the Swedish model

413
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:51,650
of village networks within a region

414
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:54,650
model of regional monopolies also in

415
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,870
gravel come Norway the local provider

416
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,060
was a copper based ADSL network so they

417
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,070
had no interest in fiber but

418
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,989
additionally in Sweden we have a mass

419
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,630
surveillance law which dictates that all

420
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,910
traffic crossing the border needs to be

421
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,459
intercepted by our civilian intelligence

422
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,930
agency so building the backhaul in to

423
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,130
Norway even though it had been very

424
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,900
cheap and convenient for the

425
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,209
municipality actually presents a problem

426
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,329
for both the national security

427
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:26,420
establishment and for the municipality

428
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:29,870
how do you solve this problem the

429
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,850
solution was to make the least efficient

430
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,229
choice they built the very long cable

431
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,159
the municipality had to spend a lot of

432
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,710
money and now of the citizens of guellen

433
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,570
Norway are still stuck at ADSL networks

434
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,850
various the Swedish gravel cone is

435
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,010
connected so that's I mean yeah you

436
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,750
can't win all the battles but it is but

437
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,820
one of many sad examples of our old

438
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,040
nationalist protectionist policies

439
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,409
stopped active community minded

440
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:59,570
Scandinavians from cooperating for a

441
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:00,950
better future I recognize that the gist

442
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,510
of the story is that things on the

443
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,269
Swedish side of the border worked out

444
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,799
fine

445
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:08,779
but I cannot be satisfied with our

446
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,408
Norwegian friends continue to suffer

447
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:14,629
under low quality internet connections

448
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:18,440
when the most easy logical choice would

449
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:20,330
have been for them not to do so these

450
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,669
issues infrastructure policy and

451
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,678
national security their age-old they

452
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,840
seem boring but they have a big impact

453
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,340
on our societies so when I was asked to

454
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,779
make a statement on what issues I

455
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,480
believe will be important going forward

456
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:35,659
they are such issues the avalanche of

457
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,759
many new many new and bad ideas must not

458
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:39,679
cause us to lose sight of the many old

459
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,149
problems that are still around and I

460
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,909
think that we can also work together to

461
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:45,709
solve them I'm not necessarily a

462
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:47,570
believer even in transcending policies

463
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,210
but I do believe that politics you solve

464
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,070
outstanding issues and I cannot do this

465
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,409
a different outstanding issue it's my

466
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,519
second topic that is somehow not only

467
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:57,110
related to the internet and the world

468
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,779
wide web but to the very nature of

469
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,189
computation itself so for years now

470
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:03,139
artificial intelligence and machine

471
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,269
learning have been trending topics in

472
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:08,360
global debates on privacy autonomy and

473
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,429
indeed as well national security these

474
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,959
discussions started around the same time

475
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,460
that I was working a lot on the Swedish

476
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,860
implementation of this of the data

477
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,960
protection regulation and therefore I

478
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,000
had fresh in my mind all of the

479
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,950
government investigations that were made

480
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,029
in the 1960s and 1970s around

481
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,340
computerization in Scandinavia and

482
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:31,879
Europe at large and it is really

483
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:35,959
surprising how computing can be such a

484
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:38,389
slow slowly advancing discussion because

485
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,129
really politically speaking one could

486
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:43,039
argue that we are still stuck in the

487
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:45,139
same place that we were 50 years ago for

488
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,539
one any new information and

489
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:49,219
communication technology brings with it

490
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,919
the hope of more precision more

491
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,259
efficiency and greater precision it is

492
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,950
envisaged that we as a society will

493
00:19:54,259 --> 00:20:00,470
become better faster stronger from the

494
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,600
deployment of many many machines in fact

495
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,669
one could argue society not just Kanda

496
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,529
Naevia but globally has the naive

497
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,019
impression that machines can save us

498
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:10,580
from ourselves

499
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:12,799
after seeing discussions and machines as

500
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,720
decision from decision makers over half

501
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,389
a century I am no longer optimistic

502
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,780
about this perspective the Internet is

503
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:20,330
great

504
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,030
it's true but it is great precisely

505
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,879
because we all get to know one another

506
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:28,460
hangout chat exchange culture or texts

507
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,340
or banter but computers in general do

508
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,580
not remove from societies any of the

509
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,780
inherent issues that arise from human to

510
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,449
human interactions

511
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,280
let me contextualise with two examples

512
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,720
from the public authority from the

513
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,629
public authorities of the state which

514
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:49,130
issues my passports are back in my crib

515
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,260
firstly when Sweden computerised its

516
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,370
public and private sector in the 1960s

517
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,629
big benefits were expected for everyone

518
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,310
Sweden would be efficient and at the

519
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,740
forefront and have national companies

520
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,080
leading the global revolution but in the

521
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,240
1970s many of the big benefits and

522
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,820
visages of centralized computing had

523
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,800
failed to materialize not only were

524
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,689
things not very much more efficient but

525
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,730
it also turned out that the new

526
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,650
centralized computer systems introduced

527
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,530
a large range of maintenance problems

528
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:21,050
which served to shift demand for labor

529
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:25,460
to other parts of the organisations but

530
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:27,560
worse for the government at least unlike

531
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,330
for railroads and telephony the

532
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,889
government also frequently had to rely

533
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,710
on private companies to acquire the

534
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,810
right expertise the government puzzled

535
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,610
by the circumstance observed that people

536
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,830
had failed to adapt themselves to the

537
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,770
machines and that further benefits will

538
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,050
surely arise down the line by the end of

539
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,760
the 1970s it was of course becoming

540
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,780
obvious that machines in themselves were

541
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,540
not infallible

542
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,250
they could have bugs malfunction and

543
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,020
when they were connected to each other

544
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,800
there could be other even deliberate

545
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,360
security issues like hacking by the 80s

546
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,040
the government realized that dealing

547
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,459
with all of these issues that come from

548
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,570
computer systems costs a lot of money

549
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,640
while there can be no particular

550
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,590
political responsibility attributed to

551
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,010
what happened next it is true that

552
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:15,409
Swedish public institutions in that time

553
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,990
developed business models to cover the

554
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,640
costs and computers that today make them

555
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,760
a slightly more sinister version of

556
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,830
Google most large Swedish public

557
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:30,830
databases are in fact by law constituted

558
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,879
erase their erected set up maintained to

559
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,178
provide careful

560
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:36,889
profiles of citizens to advertisers this

561
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:38,719
is true for the tax database it's true

562
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,849
for the traffic registry it's true for

563
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:43,249
the general population database and also

564
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:45,559
for the corporate registry because by

565
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:48,289
law citizens cannot as they do on Web

566
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:50,229
Services spoof information so hide their

567
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:53,119
information or obfuscate their data

568
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:55,699
behind junk information these government

569
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,948
profiling activities are not as in the

570
00:22:55,699 --> 00:23:00,109
case of Web Services machine learning

571
00:22:57,949 --> 00:23:02,029
based there is no need for the

572
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:04,279
government to resort to statistical

573
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:06,589
models to explain the properties of

574
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,690
personal of individual members of the

575
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:12,379
Swedish public because they have enough

576
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,779
data to be deterministic so I would be

577
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:16,789
the first person to concede that the 90s

578
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:18,949
and the early 2000s weren't actually

579
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,599
that bad though broadband rollout the

580
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:23,989
personal computer reform peer-to-peer

581
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,639
networks all of this worked out the tax

582
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:27,979
authority was also reformed in the way

583
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:30,228
in a way in Sweden that enabled them to

584
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:32,449
make good use of computers for the vast

585
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:34,129
majority of my life declaring taxes in

586
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:36,949
Sweden has for most people been as

587
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:38,238
simple as sending a text message those

588
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,219
types of reforms of course they're

589
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:43,209
helpful and they inspire confidence that

590
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:45,589
computers sometimes need to good things

591
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:48,679
and you will forgive me I hope from

592
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:50,269
delaying much on these for not delaying

593
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,559
too much on these hopeful topics at this

594
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:54,409
time but I will come back to them at

595
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,359
some point later unfortunately though

596
00:23:54,409 --> 00:24:00,619
all of the good aspects of internet and

597
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:04,639
connectivity have not really been

598
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:07,309
embraced by our public sectors at large

599
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:09,439
by 2010 for instance the Swedish

600
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:12,109
government had relabeled computerization

601
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,049
as digitalization and appeared to go

602
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:17,198
straight back to the 1960s again there

603
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:20,149
were predictions of Swedish best nuts

604
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:22,549
poorly defined and ever in the future

605
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:24,049
the sweet Sweden will be the best at

606
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:26,479
digitalization there is no particular

607
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:28,069
concretization of what isis narratives

608
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:29,659
emerged where it was not the case that

609
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:31,039
the internet connected people and

610
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:33,409
enabled friendships and cultural

611
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,389
exchange or world peace but where in

612
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:38,089
fact the Internet was a suspect of low

613
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:39,769
morality and were individuals attacked

614
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:41,418
other individuals but somehow the

615
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:44,269
government would make this into a more

616
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,350
efficient public sector it was also no

617
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:47,210
longer the case that this

618
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,010
through thoughtful use of information

619
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,140
and communication technologies could

620
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,510
serve its people it was the case that

621
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,580
individual members of the public were

622
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,559
harming individuals of the public and

623
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,178
that the state's primary role and

624
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,020
responsibility was punishing individuals

625
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:04,580
who were Internet users this is for a

626
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:09,260
large part the same discussion that was

627
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,629
had in the 1970s that there's these vain

628
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,250
aspirations that computers will save the

629
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,559
public sector from some built-in

630
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,809
inefficiencies and there's also a

631
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,399
feeling that if only people could adapt

632
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,590
themselves and all of their social

633
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,780
interactions to the machines it will be

634
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,220
ok there's never anything wrong with the

635
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:29,178
machines there's only ever something

636
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,850
wrong with the people I say and perhaps

637
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:34,520
with blissful nostalgia of the 1970s and

638
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,678
the early 2000s that we should not ask

639
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,900
what we can do for our governments when

640
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:45,320
it comes to computers we should ask what

641
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:47,150
our computers can do for us and it's

642
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,280
true that we should expect more from our

643
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:53,090
governments then for them to pit us

644
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,200
against one another it's not useful so

645
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,299
secondly the bethought you've been on

646
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,070
law enforcement issues and in particular

647
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,780
those demands for new law enforcement

648
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,220
competencies that require intrusive and

649
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,590
monitoring surveillance such as data

650
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,600
retention data requests are hacking in

651
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,330
this perspective I might be a bit speed

652
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,830
and centric all of the EU member states

653
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,990
have their own legal traditions and

654
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,620
histories so I apologize for this in

655
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,200
advance

656
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,989
it's my confinements my own confinement

657
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,039
to the Westphalian state if you saw well

658
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,020
it's been frequently raised especially

659
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,210
right those that fear the internet and

660
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,070
computers that these platforms are a bit

661
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,270
like the wild wild west and that they

662
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,610
must be regulated

663
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:30,889
I have increasingly come to share this

664
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,600
view but not from the perspective from

665
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,309
which it is normally raised but rather

666
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,620
from the perspective of the impunity

667
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:40,879
with which our government authorities

668
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:42,229
act on these platforms data retention is

669
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,000
an age-old debate that rose to

670
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,299
prominence again as the European Court

671
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,409
of Justice the EU's highest court

672
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:51,100
declared it disproportional and

673
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:53,780
unnecessary in December of 2016

674
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,100
favoring instead measures targeted at

675
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:58,570
specific individuals who are

676
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,570
specifically suspected of a crime

677
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,780
it's not new on the agenda there are

678
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,190
Swedish police officers have been

679
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,410
working since I was in third grade of

680
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,650
elementary school on creating global

681
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,930
conditions for data retention while I

682
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,370
cherished the 1990s and the early 2000s

683
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,170
I also acknowledge that in the

684
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,330
background there were dark forces at

685
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,820
play and it's been litigated that her

686
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,070
attention many times as many as nine

687
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,350
European constitutional courts have

688
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,689
declared data retention illegal before

689
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:31,490
Sweden had its data retention Act passed

690
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:34,190
in 2012 you would think that in such a

691
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,050
challenged situation and with such

692
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,760
little evidence to back up the

693
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,740
efficiency of data retention the Swedish

694
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,440
law enforcement having nagged for twenty

695
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,240
years to get that tool would have

696
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,730
ensured that they got the statistical

697
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,130
evidence on the usefulness of having

698
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,140
data retention as a working tool but you

699
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,820
would think wrongly in fact law

700
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,380
enforcement efficiency in Sweden has

701
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,210
been on the decline for a couple of

702
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,850
decades and it's frequently an

703
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:02,390
aggressively raced in the media the drop

704
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,669
in efficiency increased after 2012 went

705
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,650
out retention was passed and the

706
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:10,190
national wide reorganization of the

707
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:12,200
Swedish police in 2015 I am told caused

708
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,320
them to not have any data unfortunately

709
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,150
on data retention at all so they don't

710
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,080
know if this helped them they feel it

711
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,760
did perhaps but we can't prove it

712
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,590
mysteriously Sweden appears not to be

713
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,650
alone in the European Union on having

714
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,120
this problem data retention is allegedly

715
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,550
the Silver Bullet that will stop

716
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,030
society's decay and yet it is impossible

717
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,980
to demonstrate exactly how it also if

718
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,440
one is being religious about that a

719
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:42,260
collection and we believe that computers

720
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,630
will bring business efficiency and save

721
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,580
us from ourselves then of course that

722
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,920
belief might be sufficient to sustain

723
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,770
the optimistic view that a lack of

724
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,950
results today may not persist into the

725
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:57,200
future but I believe that in the data

726
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,780
retention discussions more than in any

727
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,200
other society debate on surveillance we

728
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,570
can see the flaws of this religion for

729
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,420
one Sweden is fairly well regulated

730
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,090
society and assesses the efficiency of

731
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,720
its public institutions a lot to the

732
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,330
point of in

733
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,070
efficiency even some would say in the

734
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,110
case of law enforcement we have direct

735
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,720
evidence that police officers in Sweden

736
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:22,939
are bad at handling evidence suffer from

737
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,190
inferior internal organization planning

738
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,340
systems and are additionally unskilled

739
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:30,710
at investigating crime scenes as far as

740
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,899
I can determined they are not trained in

741
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,190
interrogation techniques and they're not

742
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,850
offered even to be trained in

743
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:40,789
interrogation techniques but religion is

744
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,199
not rational and the public institution

745
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:44,539
in charge of evaluating police

746
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,330
activities has increasingly come to be

747
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:50,870
seen as a conspiracy monger devalued and

748
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:54,020
insulted for covering up facts and it's

749
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,549
generally portrayed as incompetent so in

750
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,530
spite of them demonstrating real

751
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:01,490
problems in the police force in Sweden

752
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:03,260
for years and in spite of arguing that

753
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,320
the police is not challenged by their

754
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,330
lack of data but by having too much data

755
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,658
retention is still seen as the Silver

756
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:13,970
Bullet which will save us from ourselves

757
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:15,710
and all of these weird conspiracy

758
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,260
Theory's they're not even raised by

759
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,299
weird people on Twitter but by

760
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,940
reasonable members of the public or even

761
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:24,590
of government ministers in law

762
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,570
enforcement activities on the internet

763
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,580
and around computers we are increasingly

764
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:31,158
living in a religious society that puts

765
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,840
beliefs above facts and that addresses

766
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,690
facts by throwing mud at the

767
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,629
institutions in charge of it this is at

768
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,030
best silly at worst it causes the

769
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,740
Swedish Minister of Interior Affairs to

770
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,928
unrighteous Lee threatened Swedish

771
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,360
telecommunications operators with fines

772
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:49,159
and withdrawn licenses because he is

773
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,469
unwilling to take responsibility for

774
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:55,280
real problems in the Swedish police

775
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:57,169
force real problems for police officers

776
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,830
and the public when real crimes are

777
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:02,870
committed if one is religious around

778
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,879
data collection and believes that

779
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,639
eventually surely it must save us from

780
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,120
ourselves this assistance on overlooking

781
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,630
the evidence and turning a blind eye to

782
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,428
real human rights concerns caused by

783
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,149
these religious methods can be justified

784
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:21,919
on faith alone so a challenge then for

785
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:24,139
individuals who seek to engage in these

786
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,440
information policy debaters how to

787
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,640
counter this

788
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,650
well the internet is great and that's

789
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,080
true but it's precisely because we all

790
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:36,140
get to know one another and hang out and

791
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,360
chat and exchange culture computers in

792
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,880
general or data do not remove from

793
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,370
society the issues that arise from you

794
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,620
men to human interactions and it brings

795
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:47,330
to to my promised finale actually which

796
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,459
addresses a topic that continues to be

797
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,320
of great concern and which influences

798
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,110
Internet users around the world every

799
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,330
day in a restrictive way that also for

800
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,820
the European Union brings the particular

801
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:01,610
challenge of creating community and

802
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,679
camaraderie I'm talking of course about

803
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,360
copyright and the botched reform that

804
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,520
the European communities recently passed

805
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,990
so to bring some perspective to this

806
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,910
issue let me point out that I can

807
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,040
physically move my body from malmö to

808
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,200
shop and harm in about 30 minutes by

809
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,990
train at no great cost or effort to

810
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,380
myself I basically just get a ticket and

811
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,730
sit and suddenly I'm across the border

812
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,740
going the other way has been made more

813
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,910
difficult by border controls enacted by

814
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,520
the stressed-out governments in

815
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,110
Stockholm that unfortunately feels the

816
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,520
economic development and fortitude of

817
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,909
the southern parts of their territory is

818
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,920
not useful but I would still argue it's

819
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,630
not more difficult and say a 40 or 50

820
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,360
minutes train ride with a brief stop at

821
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,440
Copenhagen Airport it's a leg structure

822
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,379
let's call it the public health

823
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,650
initiative if I were to attempt moving

824
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:51,260
an mp3 file containing music across the

825
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,910
same border I would be easily stuck in

826
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,870
license negotiations for two years

827
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:58,790
before it succeeded and if I were taking

828
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,770
anything and if I were anything other

829
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,810
than a big commercial entity it would be

830
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,570
seriously challenging for me even to get

831
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,120
the right legal expertise if it's an mp4

832
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,919
file containing not only audio but also

833
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,120
video I will argue that I have next to

834
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,800
no chance of transferring the file

835
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,070
legally without institutional backing

836
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,470
this is of course really ridiculous we

837
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,720
allegedly have free movement to people

838
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,110
in the European Union but we cannot move

839
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,730
the things that connect people culture

840
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,340
experiences shared happiness references

841
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,710
across the same borders for the longest

842
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,110
of time sharing cultural experiences

843
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,870
with Germans has been a massive pain

844
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,790
because every time I try I get the

845
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,719
response that they find the video is not

846
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,210
available in there

847
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,580
country the European Union has been

848
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,020
trying to address some of these issues

849
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,299
well about four times actually in the

850
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,370
past four years always failed they

851
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,500
always hit the wall they tried to get

852
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,360
rid of geo blocking but then somebody

853
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,880
inserted an exception for audio-visual

854
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,158
content so the very thing that caused

855
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,380
your blocking to be an issue is still an

856
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,440
issue but at least now I can order stuff

857
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,049
from Amazon the TA which of course I'd

858
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,520
never do because I don't speak German

859
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,469
and also most people of the European

860
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,780
Union actually had no pressing need to

861
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:13,899
order stuff from Amazon that they a they

862
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:17,869
just wanted to share YouTube videos of

863
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:19,668
schnappi does clinical Co deal they

864
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,770
tried to make special rules for cultural

865
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:24,440
heritage but they end up imposing on

866
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,359
librarians due diligence I ended up

867
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,929
being able to access the train schedule

868
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:32,239
from Luxembourg to Brussels for 1862

869
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:33,710
which again I mean it was great but only

870
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,868
for about two seconds and if we're

871
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,270
honest knowing when people could depart

872
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:40,399
from Luxembourg to Brussels in 1862 may

873
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,399
be of academic and Trust to a small

874
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,109
range of individuals studying the

875
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,270
history of trains or public transport

876
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:49,549
but it doesn't really cut it if what

877
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,219
we're trying to do is build real

878
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,260
relationships between broad groups of

879
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,959
Scandinavians and Luxembourg ins and

880
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:59,900
Belgians in the 2010s or the 20 20 20 20

881
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,270
s just doesn't cut it a fairly

882
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,099
well-known Swedish company I go again

883
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,220
back to my native country

884
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,810
Spotify exemplifies the failures of the

885
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,029
European markets as much as it

886
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,470
exemplifies how easily accessible

887
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,750
streaming services could have been a

888
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,089
good market opportunity for creative

889
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:20,960
industries going forward their launch

890
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:23,660
pattern was Sweden Netherlands UK and

891
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,390
the US only after establishing

892
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,399
themselves on the US market were they

893
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,680
able to come back to the EU to establish

894
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,589
themselves in other jurisdictions here

895
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,480
such as Germany or France meanwhile many

896
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:38,359
Europeans especially the more tech-savvy

897
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,130
ones had been using Spotify by proxies

898
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:41,509
essentially cheating the service by

899
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,220
claiming that they were listening from a

900
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,859
jurisdiction in which they were not

901
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,890
based and doing so - Spotify is that

902
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:50,779
detriment that since fortifies licensing

903
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,560
requirements would actually not have

904
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,900
covered such consumption

905
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,910
but it is surely a failure of the

906
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,430
European inner market that new services

907
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,410
cannot approach it without first

908
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,350
establishing a strong presence in the US

909
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,540
market it gives a big advantage to US

910
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,759
companies who of course by default

911
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,730
establish themselves in the US before

912
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,350
they go to Europe any new company has

913
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,810
twice the work and must be twice as good

914
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,630
to have half a chance of becoming an EU

915
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:21,690
company at all as does the US company

916
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,700
these are real economic problems that

917
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,210
the European Union should really want to

918
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,649
solve some video streaming services have

919
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,320
become popular across the European

920
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:33,390
Economic Area as well but they are us

921
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,030
video streaming services by the logic I

922
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,589
just presented the response of the EU

923
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,210
was to force these services to have a

924
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:42,360
certain percentage of locally produced

925
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,880
content because it does not register

926
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,940
with the vast majority of politicians in

927
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,770
the EU that the issue is that European

928
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,510
companies cannot establish themselves in

929
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,970
Europe without establishing themselves

930
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:57,030
in the US and that this is economically

931
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,919
inefficient and very harmful instead of

932
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,230
lowering the bar for market entry they

933
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,970
erased it making it now even more

934
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:06,210
challenging to be a European provider

935
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,859
here this is a sadly familiar pattern of

936
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,900
all information policies of the European

937
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,700
Union and its member states making

938
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,200
things more expensive making things more

939
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,200
difficult and not solving the real

940
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,240
problems that actually exist for

941
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,069
instance the European Union was really

942
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,810
the originating point of several of the

943
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,550
largest most popular and cherished

944
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,400
popular platforms that have ever existed

945
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,320
on the internet I speak of course of

946
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,500
services like oink The Pirate Bay

947
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,600
and Demonoid they had worldwide reach

948
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,920
and like no other services connected

949
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,950
people around the world on shared

950
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,780
cultural experiences large and small

951
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,549
it's no surprise that nationalism and

952
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,070
fear feeds off of the lack of

953
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,810
understanding one another and pirate

954
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,150
copying movies and music could have

955
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,810
contributed to mitigating such ignorant

956
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,550
resentment between peoples instead the

957
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,320
European Union banned these successful

958
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,330
services just like they have now raised

959
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,550
market entry barriers with video

960
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:02,009
streaming services while continuously

961
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,110
failing to make stronger efforts at

962
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,090
facilitating the establishment of EU

963
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,620
cultural services

964
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,280
a lot of people may not like it but

965
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,930
that's how it is the European Union was

966
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,790
really good at one thing and then it

967
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,009
banned that thing because that's how

968
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:19,080
Europe rolls and then it aggressively

969
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,330
complains about being a digital colony

970
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,490
maybe not in Denmark but in France let's

971
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:26,310
say because complaining is apparently

972
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:30,689
how to sort things out while taking care

973
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:32,009
of yourself isn't so to finish off I

974
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,600
would like to stress that these issues

975
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,460
that I have raised only alluded to a

976
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,040
larger framework of lack of European

977
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,200
strategy and the increasing hostility

978
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,110
from governments against ordinary people

979
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,060
ultimately the very broadest question is

980
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,040
whether Europeans are enemies or Europe

981
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,290
or friends of Europe and I believe that

982
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,120
Europeans by and large our friends of

983
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:54,120
Europe and that such a mindset should

984
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,640
also dictate how policies in any area is

985
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,730
developed I believe it's in all of our

986
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,290
interest interest that our interactions

987
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,600
and communications are at the forefront

988
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,940
of any political discussion and with our

989
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,250
I mean us in the room but also everyone

990
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,870
in society at large because only through

991
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,820
our interactions and friendships and

992
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,410
joint efforts can we solve other

993
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,210
outstanding issues whether they be

994
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,470
unequal distribution of income the

995
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,940
relative powerlessness of our

996
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,009
governments in the face of investment

997
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,500
capital the climate crisis or whatever

998
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,300
other topic you want to solve it is

999
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,520
precisely because it is our cross-border

1000
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,380
friendship and mutual interactions that

1001
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,390
we must continuously raise and address

1002
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,860
the problems of our governments

1003
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,690
religiously holding on to mass

1004
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,720
surveillance as a catch-all solution

1005
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,730
that all evidence point points to being

1006
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,549
a different problem entirely that we

1007
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,740
must continuously attempt to resist the

1008
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:47,190
image of citizens as the natural enemy

1009
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:49,140
of their governments and each other and

1010
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,970
the fear of any European or for that

1011
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,710
matter American economic web based

1012
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,759
activities so prevalent in our cultural

1013
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:59,340
establishments so this is one I have

1014
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,470
worked for for the past 13 years what I

1015
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,590
looked like I will be continuing to work

1016
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:08,640
for for some time and I hope that you

1017
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:11,940
are all willing to also join me in such

1018
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,089
work and I want to thank you all for

1019
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,190
your kind attention tonight have a nice

1020
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:32,680
Bourne hack 2011

1021
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:37,359
[Applause]

1022
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,359
do we have any questions for Amelia

1023
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,569
nobody about copyright lengths academics

1024
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:53,390
when they examine come rights a is lower

1025
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:55,849
copyright length would be better a comic

1026
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,460
economically was that considered during

1027
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:07,700
the recent EU copyright legislation why

1028
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:09,470
not yes why why not because it's so

1029
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,879
copyright is a very difficult field

1030
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:14,410
because there's so many entrenched

1031
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,640
interests that are extremely it's also

1032
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:19,009
Europe has difficulties making its own

1033
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,390
strategies yeah so in the copyright

1034
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,519
discussion what you have is a fairly

1035
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,319
entrenched establishment in the US which

1036
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:25,819
is very well rooted in the US political

1037
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,009
environment and the u.s. is very

1038
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,779
strategic and then you have in the

1039
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,549
Member States also these copyrights and

1040
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:34,369
frenched interests the member state

1041
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:37,130
level which are also fairly strategic in

1042
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:38,960
their national territories and so on

1043
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,819
both sides of the Atlantic because there

1044
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,230
is such a large resistance to making any

1045
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:45,200
changes

1046
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,579
it just wasn't it wasn't even ever

1047
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,589
raised that you could lower the

1048
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:50,539
copyright times because this is seen as

1049
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,730
far too out there I mean even small

1050
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:56,740
things like does anyone in this room

1051
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,740
know what the Berne three-step test is

1052
00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:01,130
nobody and has anybody heard of the Bern

1053
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,169
three sub test you you're not supposed

1054
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,809
to because it's like a weird feature of

1055
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,509
copyright international law that was

1056
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:10,519
created in whatever the 1970s and

1057
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:12,259
somebody proposed to make it's like

1058
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:13,879
three steps that you test something and

1059
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:16,279
basically and somebody proposed a small

1060
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,680
tweak of the third step of the test and

1061
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:22,660
it was immediately attacked by you know

1062
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:25,038
global copyright organizations as being

1063
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:29,538
revolutionary and harmful and you know

1064
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:32,059
buccaneering and trying to kill people

1065
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:35,089
so it's just like one of these one of

1066
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:37,869
these political discussions we're even

1067
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:40,578
making relatively theoretical and boring

1068
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:42,859
proposals like ah let's tweak the third

1069
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:44,189
step of the dis test that nobody ever

1070
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:47,119
heard of

1071
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:49,859
can create an alarmist and visceral

1072
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:55,650
opposition and that makes politicians

1073
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:58,098
also very scared yeah I was I was

1074
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,989
encouraged by the discussion and in this

1075
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:02,789
spring because back when I started

1076
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:06,420
working for copyright I was called a

1077
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:08,339
murderer and leech and a butcher I think

1078
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,029
I've been called maybe every bad name

1079
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:14,549
there isn't the book but the spring at

1080
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:16,589
least there was sufficient opposition to

1081
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:18,359
this harmful narrative of cultural

1082
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:21,650
lockdown that they could only call me

1083
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:24,930
bought and zombie so you know it's a

1084
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:27,119
over time this bone resolves itself

1085
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,279
perhaps but we're still a long way off

1086
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:42,119
and continued efforts are needed if we

1087
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:47,249
want to have cultural exchange know how

1088
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:49,109
the politicians are yeah to say the

1089
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,448
least I like they are not doing the

1090
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:53,939
right things but how do we make them do

1091
00:43:51,449 --> 00:44:00,660
the right things instead of doing the

1092
00:43:53,939 --> 00:44:03,719
populist things or whatever the it so

1093
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,729
yeah it's a difficult question I think

1094
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,039
through the European Union there are

1095
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:11,819
some opportunities to work with you know

1096
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:14,189
real really good kind of moral leaders

1097
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:16,349
so I know this from like when I was

1098
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:18,479
young I was very skeptical of democratic

1099
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:20,099
traditions and I didn't really see what

1100
00:44:18,479 --> 00:44:21,779
was the point and politicians were very

1101
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:23,660
distanced and you know right now my

1102
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:26,219
Minister of Justice makes angry tweets

1103
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:30,089
you know he's like a boring version of

1104
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:32,459
Donald Trump it's extremely sad so I was

1105
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:33,719
quiet disenfranchised when I was younger

1106
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:35,819
but when I came to the European

1107
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:37,859
Parliament and I was there for two years

1108
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:41,189
I realized that actually there's a lot

1109
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:43,650
of political leaders in Europe who have

1110
00:44:41,189 --> 00:44:44,969
a very strong moral fiber and even

1111
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,039
though some of them are like Christian

1112
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:49,319
Democrats that I personally have not so

1113
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,269
many things in common with I recognized

1114
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:54,860
that they are working towards the values

1115
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:57,169
that they cherish and the table even in

1116
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:01,520
way full of integrity and kind of honor

1117
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:03,830
in a way Europe is also not so it's a

1118
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,750
bit isolated from some of these extreme

1119
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,580
conflicts at number state level between

1120
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,670
national security establishments and

1121
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,380
markets and so forth there's less media

1122
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,030
attention of course in Europe so I'm

1123
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,040
hoping that by having a stronger

1124
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:19,030
European framework or by helping support

1125
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,110
the European frameworks like the gdpr or

1126
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,730
even stuff like the network and

1127
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:25,190
information security directive which I

1128
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,010
dis I know but I think it's generally

1129
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:29,540
small steps in the right direction so by

1130
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:32,480
working to reinforce these good

1131
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:39,290
tendencies of Europe maybe we can

1132
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:41,990
somehow eventually outmaneuver member

1133
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:43,430
states yeah the Westphalian state but

1134
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,200
then you would just have to kind of I

1135
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:50,770
know that right now Denmark has an

1136
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:53,029
extremely interesting MEP who is also

1137
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,700
that I've interacted with in the past

1138
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,530
Karen Melchior so you might be able to

1139
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,109
you know interact with her if you're for

1140
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,510
Denmark most of the Member States have

1141
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:08,870
at least one MEP who's who's not at all

1142
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:10,670
weird and so we reach out to them and

1143
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,380
see you or you know try to work out if

1144
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:14,360
there's an opportunity to engage on this

1145
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,160
level or engage directly with regulatory

1146
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,010
bodies that implement European laws

1147
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,290
which in Denmark would be the ear virus

1148
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,600
I can't pronounce it at all but the ear

1149
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:25,910
valves the people that do telecoms and

1150
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,860
maybe the dot that they'll see not you

1151
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:31,490
know and try to boost their confidence

1152
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:36,020
and acting on these European ideals say

1153
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:38,779
yeah stuff like this a small note on

1154
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:41,030
that Karn is actually gonna be here on

1155
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,890
Monday hosting a keynote it's not

1156
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,920
announced yet but yeah she will be

1157
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:48,890
around we have another question yes I

1158
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,900
see a lot of good laws in the EU and one

1159
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:54,080
of them I really like is the one with

1160
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,190
the roaming so when you arrive in a

1161
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,319
European country there is now

1162
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,089
free-roaming from for ya does something

1163
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,740
special happens when we get the good

1164
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:03,509
laws because there must of course also

1165
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,509
be resistance to these laws but they

1166
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:08,460
still get bolted through or how does

1167
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:14,550
that happen because I found you're

1168
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:15,750
talkin slightly negative yeah yeah so

1169
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,819
roaming happened

1170
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,880
roaming was originally introduced like

1171
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:23,220
in 2008 or so and it was because the den

1172
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,619
commissioner had failed to impose so the

1173
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,689
reason why in Sweden there's such good

1174
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:29,520
internet connectivity is because

1175
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,349
functional separation was imposed on our

1176
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,180
big operators and this didn't happen in

1177
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,010
France or in Germany or in Spain and

1178
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:37,109
that's why generally in those countries

1179
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,270
you have a lot of entrenched interests

1180
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:40,799
still vertically integrated monoliths

1181
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,660
that sit on copper networks and do

1182
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,010
rent-seeking so the demo commissioner

1183
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,779
made a proposal to get rid of that

1184
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:51,950
situation in the big Member States

1185
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,569
Germany France Spain in 2006 but failed

1186
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:56,189
because the vertically integrated

1187
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:58,140
operators were not at all happy of

1188
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:59,670
losing economic interest and then

1189
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,848
roaming was launched as a kind of

1190
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:06,390
audience like a publicity thing which

1191
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:08,040
the operators didn't really mind and

1192
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:10,230
that could also be simply passed in one

1193
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,900
year actually making price regulation on

1194
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:15,300
markets is very difficult and in the

1195
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,920
European Union a particular challenge of

1196
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,380
the roaming legislation that continues

1197
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,300
to exist today is that you are operator

1198
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:25,260
when you go abroad it's not allowed to

1199
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:27,780
charge you but the operators are allowed

1200
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:31,770
to charge each other so this is actually

1201
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:34,980
not very good for mobile operators who

1202
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:36,480
don't own their own core networks which

1203
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,010
means that in order to have effective

1204
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,420
competition you need to build many

1205
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:41,030
different parallel networks in the

1206
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,930
country so you don't just have one

1207
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,550
infrastructure for Denmark but maybe

1208
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,190
three or four parallel ones and that's

1209
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:51,030
more expensive and less efficient from a

1210
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:52,740
coverage perspective so personally I

1211
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,510
could have been happy if they solved the

1212
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,310
roaming issue in some other way kind of

1213
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:59,250
more similar to open peering that we've

1214
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,839
seen in Wired networks and I know it's

1215
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,480
months normally some of you might work

1216
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,680
on mobile network standards or

1217
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,790
technologies and you will say well open

1218
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,710
peering doesn't work because the

1219
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:10,170
technology is very different but you

1220
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,760
know I think that moving some

1221
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:15,240
in that direction would have been a more

1222
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,950
productive use of the European Union's

1223
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,060
resources and the expertise that we have

1224
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:22,009
in the Member States and having price

1225
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:24,509
regulation now we're stuck with roaming

1226
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:26,250
and every all the politicians like it

1227
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,800
because all the voters like it and it's

1228
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,570
not for me it was never optimal but I'm

1229
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,430
not running for elections so I don't

1230
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:37,470
have to say that things that you like I

1231
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:41,220
also like do we have any more questions

1232
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:42,189
I see none let's give a big round of

1233
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:50,718
applause for Amelia

1234
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:50,719
[Applause]
