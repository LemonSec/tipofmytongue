1
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,250
you

2
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,000
you

3
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:16,309
okay hear me all right cool

4
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:21,319
hey everyone thanks for the the four

5
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:24,799
people that were let's shut up I like to

6
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:33,819
talk a bit about the generation the

7
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:38,060
threats they facing so Europe America

8
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm an IT security analyst for OCC RP we

9
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,060
stand for the organized crime and

10
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,268
corruption reporting project we're an

11
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,720
organization with their headquarters in

12
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:50,690
Sarajevo we do cross-border

13
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,349
investigations into organized crime and

14
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,120
corruption I'm also coming tenor of this

15
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,879
thing called LT always stands for

16
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,829
off-the-record messaging I like to say

17
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,578
hi to my Ecuadorian comrades who might

18
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:06,909
be watching this and we also hiring in

19
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:12,379
case you're interested

20
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:14,629
so also CRP is that kind of corruption

21
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:17,448
reporting project we have our

22
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:21,349
headquarters in Sarajevo but we're based

23
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:23,079
in 40 more countries around the world we

24
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:28,099
do a lot of cross-border investigations

25
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:30,319
into corruption as corruption we do

26
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:33,828
really high-level corruption with a lot

27
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,339
of money involved you probably need a

28
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:39,760
bank or any kind of other entity in

29
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,180
another country to make that possible

30
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,918
like tax havens or European banks for

31
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,760
example some of those Noseworthy

32
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,349
investigations

33
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,409
some of you might remember are like the

34
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:58,250
Azerbaijani laundromat there was

35
00:03:54,409 --> 00:04:00,069
basically a scheme by high-level

36
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,209
officials in the Azerbaijani government

37
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:05,298
using European banks and other

38
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:09,109
institutions to launder around 2.7

39
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:11,919
billion dollars actually let's see if I

40
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,919
can actually give you

41
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:21,259
kind of overview of that so it was a

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,780
complex money laundering operation a

43
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:25,669
slush fund and handle 2.9 billion

44
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,799
dollars over a two year period through

45
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,580
four shell companies registered in the

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,180
UK which have been uncovered by joint

47
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,030
investigations by a bunch of journalists

48
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:41,680
and organizations across the world from

49
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:45,020
Denmark as a CRP so this is item under

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:52,070
the tight in Belgium Novaya Gazeta in

51
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:55,849
Russia for example a bunch of others so

52
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,130
that's one of those it's sort of

53
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:01,310
interesting as it has a lot of like and

54
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:05,389
local connection here as Danske Bank had

55
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:08,120
their brands in Estonia and they sort of

56
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,490
turned a blind eye to a bunch of these

57
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,720
transactions as they were already want

58
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,759
in 2000 I think in 2017 and also before

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,210
that that they were sort of facilitating

60
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,460
and even had a good jack imbalances

61
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,049
within the organization to make to sort

62
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,049
of stop these practices from happening

63
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,139
another one is the great Gambia highest

64
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:37,460
the way that we publish this year

65
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:39,229
this is a really interesting story it's

66
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,638
from one of the former presidents called

67
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:46,159
yaha JAMA that ruled over Gambia and he

68
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,659
took over power in 1994 using coup

69
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:52,159
d'etat he was sort of you know he

70
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:57,590
cracked down on a bunch of people

71
00:05:52,159 --> 00:06:00,830
basically and then he this bizarre

72
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,469
personality that saw through headlines

73
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,150
where he gave himself five titles and

74
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:09,560
claimed to be able to cure AIDS and

75
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:16,638
stuff like that and then of course you

76
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:19,190
know he he gained a lot of wealth but we

77
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,389
like people never really knew how you

78
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,810
know how much wealth and where that

79
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:27,300
wealth went to

80
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,300
until now so there's like a bunch of

81
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:33,520
information we got that we published

82
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,510
where I think the amount of laundering

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,270
was around like 1 billion dollars and

84
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:45,760
that went through like you know from

85
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:51,340
Gambia to China to like Hezbollah as far

86
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:54,070
as I understood on the story so if you

87
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,919
India to the Hezbollah laundromats it's

88
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,110
a super bizarre story of really if you

89
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,230
want to read a really bizarre story I

90
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,020
will definitely check that one out and

91
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,940
then there was his other laundromats and

92
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,820
happened this year that we published

93
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:15,160
called the troika laundromat is

94
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:19,200
basically again so you might have it

95
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,550
this one basically it's a bunch of

96
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,750
corrupt politicians and organized crime

97
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,820
figures for example like either

98
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,830
connected to the Kremlin or like the FSB

99
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,680
that use European banks to launder a

100
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:37,810
bunch of money again through danske bank

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:43,690
for example so a signature is on our

102
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:54,330
front page in the top of course is not

103
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:55,770
really gonna load no thanks all right so

104
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,270
[Music]

105
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,159
we actually gave them a war last year

106
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,400
for being the most corrupt actor of the

107
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,250
year as they've sort of facilitated a

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,070
bunch of money laundering schemes from

109
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,860
all across the world basically and now

110
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,349
there's an investigation this sort of in

111
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,510
total is two hundred seventy billion

112
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,400
dollars worth of transactions that are

113
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,820
in the investigation at the moment

114
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:26,590
so I guess the sort of summary is is

115
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:32,708
that we published and found out who a

116
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:35,049
sorcerer gives the information though

117
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:37,208
there was money bouncing between this

118
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,689
particular brands with their stone

119
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:44,410
danske bank bank that went through

120
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:48,220
several companies in Europe in London

121
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,719
they were sort of dormant but they were

122
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,730
not actually dormant as they were doing

123
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,970
like you know hundreds of millions of or

124
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:58,120
tens of millions of transactions each

125
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:04,870
day or the worst was several tens of

126
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:09,070
millions supervisor so when you do these

127
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:11,260
sort of reporting people tend to get

128
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:17,170
upset as she sort of like dry up their

129
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,970
money laundering scheme so like what do

130
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:28,510
you do sort of people think that there's

131
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:30,269
sort of threats that we might face don't

132
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:35,279
be shy

133
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:41,550
yeah death is definitely one of them

134
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:43,870
yeah and I think is actually more

135
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,209
physical almost more harassment and

136
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,029
actually like technology-wise which is

137
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:52,119
not entirely unsurprising I guess it's

138
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:55,510
easy to you know intimidate somebody

139
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,920
then like using some kind of expensive

140
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:03,520
operation to try to compromise them and

141
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,110
so there's this thing where people will

142
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,069
just sort of say like you know you know

143
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,440
you signaling use tor well I think

144
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,600
that's I don't think a lot of people on

145
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,970
the no but like the use signal used to

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
always sort of use as a meme as the

147
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,020
social security advice that people tend

148
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,690
to give but also like that doesn't

149
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,630
really fly with us right it's really

150
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:30,760
reporting from like you know Kazakhstan

151
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:33,279
Azerbaijan to Sudan to Gambia and other

152
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,220
parts of South America

153
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,750
so we have all kind of like different

154
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,709
continents with very different threat

155
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:43,149
models well I guess in Europe what's the

156
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,239
time at least in Western Europe you

157
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:48,730
won't really you might end up in some

158
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,920
kind of cold case

159
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,020
but in Sudan that might mean that you

160
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,479
might you know get killed or something

161
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:00,380
like that it was very different from

162
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,340
what was involved so actually something

163
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:08,780
that happened this month was Beeville

164
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:10,280
sour bulgarian partner got this European

165
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,390
investigation order submitted towards

166
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:17,000
them sort of days after they audit the

167
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,040
Bulgarian anti-corruption chief let's

168
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,650
resign following an investigation by

169
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,890
them they have been accused of sort of

170
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:29,030
like cyber terrorism where the framing

171
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:31,310
that the government was using was that

172
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:34,040
there was this leaked telegram chat

173
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:37,310
where they would turn on the water

174
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,740
sprinklers in the politicians office to

175
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,989
water them and they made up this claim

176
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,510
because the some of the people living

177
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,000
elsewhere they use this European

178
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:54,740
investigation in order to maybe try to

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,980
get to the server and stuff so that's

180
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:04,000
like some of the recent threats that we

181
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:05,210
do then this is other one where

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,730
journalists

183
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:16,840
Pavel Shara met from Belarus was killed

184
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,840
in a car bomb in Ukraine in the morning

185
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,880
after he might have upset some people

186
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,250
with some of the reporting that he did

187
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,780
and the Ukrainian police and

188
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,050
investigation the government wasn't

189
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:34,400
really keen on like investigating the

190
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:38,270
entire murder and so I also sharpy

191
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,340
together with slits to its full Maidan

192
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,590
reconstruction on that and I've resulted

193
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,370
in and in a documentary called killing

194
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,200
Pavel

195
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,450
where they made a complete

196
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,400
reconstruction of what - PDF has

197
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:58,310
happened during the time you can find it

198
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,459
on that website if you want to look how

199
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:05,029
that happened

200
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:08,529
so you know this like tough fox

201
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:10,820
investigation orders sort of misused

202
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:14,720
against journalism or like you know

203
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,160
murder and stuff like that but then

204
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,600
there's also the online threats and

205
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,810
actually I guess the online threats are

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:26,839
almost cuter in a way of course like

207
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:29,180
it's a lot easier to fish journalists or

208
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,790
people in general I guess there's not

209
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,020
much of a difference between like other

210
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:39,140
piloting of companies or organizations

211
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:41,750
something actually this week cyber

212
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,270
connect and some other researchers found

213
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,610
out that they made a complete clone of

214
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:50,120
like protein meal and try to fish people

215
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:57,680
like that many journalists targeting you

216
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:59,600
know the Kremlin or Russia so people

217
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,370
been saying that maybe it's like you

218
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,020
know attribution is hot anyway but as

219
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:11,540
they have been investigating mostly

220
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:15,709
Russia based things sort of they started

221
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,689
pointing towards Russia I mean we we see

222
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:18,859
this as well quite a lot is that fishing

223
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,140
is definitely the number one attack

224
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,250
factor

225
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:26,630
luckily sort of two-factor

226
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:30,709
authentication and training helps quite

227
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:32,959
a bit they've not really been I mean

228
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:37,069
it's always half to half right I mean in

229
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,380
general I don't think it definitely

230
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,620
helps that you have to factor on to the

231
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,450
occasion it's not you know I mean look

232
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,890
at the DNC hack but I think they still

233
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,300
went through the the two-factor

234
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:57,319
authentication but it's definitely I use

235
00:14:49,300 --> 00:15:05,329
I had a second factor of I think the the

236
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:07,209
Gmail thing for no it's not as a mess

237
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:11,270
it's actually like Google Authenticator

238
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:12,859
so that's TOTP right yeah so definitely

239
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,069
the TSP we

240
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:20,870
definitely do not incur it's SMS to FAA

241
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:22,940
we we explicitly disable death as

242
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,060
apparently still getting access to ss7

243
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:30,040
is apparently rather easy so it rather

244
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,040
not be talking about that

245
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:39,200
also DDoS attacks so we don't really

246
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,860
like CloudFlare because of that we have

247
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:46,340
somewhat our own caching infrastructure

248
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:48,560
built it's open source it's sort of like

249
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,630
a bunch of engine acts running across

250
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,869
multiple providers around the world that

251
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:58,900
do caching of the front end with a sort

252
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,920
of like an a couple hour long cache

253
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:04,459
which is actually open source and our

254
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:07,610
gate lab I would definitely be

255
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,930
interested if people run or have hosting

256
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,120
providers here and they would like to

257
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,500
help out with this we'd like to talk

258
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,980
with you if you have any spare bandwidth

259
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:21,650
for this some other stuff we created was

260
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:26,090
we tend to do a lot of conferences and

261
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:29,630
we don't necessarily trust the Wi-Fi

262
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:32,180
there so we bring our own routers take

263
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,700
over the open wrt we deploy wire guard

264
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,229
on them that's completely open-source

265
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:43,100
it's automated to salt stack which I

266
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:46,460
guess it's just another puppet with an

267
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:53,030
agent running you can get it from our

268
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:56,630
gate lab then this this more weight

269
00:16:53,030 --> 00:17:00,290
fretting I think this is actually an

270
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:03,459
interesting one as journalists sort of

271
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,859
that job is to receive information and

272
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:10,250
then we of course train a lot of people

273
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:13,609
when they join the organization into

274
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,660
like how do you how do you you know set

275
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,790
them up with like two-factor

276
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,690
authentication with TOTP and stuff like

277
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:23,060
that password managers and but then you

278
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,580
know you get the thing like

279
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,740
you know whatever journalist obtain any

280
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,169
kind of documents right and they click

281
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,550
on it and watching the files then they

282
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,900
might have already clicked on it on

283
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:37,310
their workstation and then how do you

284
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:44,090
how do you deal with that so most of the

285
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:50,770
time if we get files like really a lot

286
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:53,330
amount of files we do it to difference

287
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,730
means what we do some conversion of the

288
00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:00,620
data to make it at least slightly saver

289
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:05,600
so hopefully you know the malicious bits

290
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,610
are actually gone from the documents but

291
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,159
you know that's not always the case so

292
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:13,879
we tend to sometimes review some of the

293
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,110
laptops of people and training at least

294
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,790
sort of works is that even if they get

295
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,889
this email out of the blue from somebody

296
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,720
offering information than they normally

297
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,540
sort of go to the security team and be

298
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,190
like hey I got this thing that seems

299
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,909
kind of weird that was not expecting any

300
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,260
kind of information could you check it

301
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,380
and then sometimes you know I was

302
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,470
actually more aware but sometimes you

303
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,630
know it's not actually targeted malware

304
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:46,490
it's actually just a banking Trojan that

305
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:48,170
they got so you know you know don't you

306
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,690
have the toilet a little more well it's

307
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,610
also disliked the general like banking

308
00:18:50,690 --> 00:19:00,710
or ransomware stuff that gets sent

309
00:18:52,610 --> 00:19:04,639
around to that then this a lot of the

310
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:07,190
document threats so some of you might

311
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,030
remember the reality winner case with

312
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,980
the printed ads and stuff like that we

313
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,570
created some kind of policy awhile ago

314
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,820
like you know what are some of the

315
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,230
threats and how you can you sort of you

316
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,129
know do some of the countermeasures with

317
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,630
that how she and how can you actually

318
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,740
check for yourself if there's any

319
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:31,690
printer that's available right so unless

320
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,690
you if I have an example and I can show

321
00:19:32,389 --> 00:20:08,309
let's see yeah right I like to document

322
00:19:53,159 --> 00:20:13,340
cloud think I guess so

323
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:18,090
I don't know like the exact timeline

324
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:22,289
from the top of my hat but I think the

325
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:26,299
intercept publish the document online

326
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:28,649
with the printer dots already available

327
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:31,408
without sort of turning it into another

328
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:35,209
document so the printed ads would no

329
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:40,859
longer be available I think from that

330
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:46,139
thing on the the job that she worked at

331
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:48,599
could go back and see like who had

332
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:53,998
access this document and I think she was

333
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:56,809
one of the six or seven culprits so they

334
00:20:53,999 --> 00:21:01,109
say of like who who access the documents

335
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:07,799
and then because she also had access the

336
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:10,609
intercepts from workstation I think that

337
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,019
gave it to be like the prime suspect of

338
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:19,710
this leak in general as far as I

339
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:22,529
remember right yeah and the intercept

340
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:28,190
also gave the exact document to the NSA

341
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:28,190
for for comment yeah

342
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,168
right then there's all the metadata so

343
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,360
even though you know we turn all all the

344
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,158
documents into you know new new

345
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,979
documents there's always some documents

346
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,120
that will still have some metadata

347
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,260
because they're like part of a really

348
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:58,408
small dump that we got and so that's the

349
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,408
people with that's created math too

350
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:07,870
that's this sort of metadata removal

351
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,309
tool that's pretty nice as it removes a

352
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,799
lot of metadata from like a bunch of

353
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:18,029
file formats from like you know dot docx

354
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:18,029
ODT I think a bunch of other things like

355
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:26,380
sorry images I think also some other

356
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,830
file formats like music file formats and

357
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,309
video file formats that works really

358
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,470
well

359
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,960
you know it's again it's not a fail-safe

360
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,779
method says you still have to check if

361
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,620
that fell format is like you know is it

362
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:44,860
better to just sort of friends or like

363
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,689
we encode that original file format to

364
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:52,870
an Evo 4 file format just to sort of

365
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:56,710
obscure where the documents might have

366
00:22:52,870 --> 00:23:00,239
come from right as I think for example

367
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:07,630
there was a case in the Netherlands a

368
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:10,409
long time ago where there was a document

369
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:14,049
about the Iraq war investigation leaks

370
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:16,690
and it seems like the the sort of -

371
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:19,500
Secret Service wanted to have like a

372
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,880
suspect inside that was their own person

373
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,789
and they were convinced that the

374
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,620
document came from one of the people at

375
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:29,049
the Secret Service

376
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:33,120
except that this in you know documents

377
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:35,110
also she has a different ministries so

378
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,168
they say well you know it's a state

379
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,649
secrets must have come from somebody

380
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:44,650
within the Secret Service

381
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,570
but it seems like you know she was

382
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,659
definitely not this the the person will

383
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,158
leak the document as so many other

384
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:54,600
people had access to it and they were

385
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,600
not actually even investigated

386
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:06,370
that's stuff then you have the canary

387
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,850
traps right so this is the sort of thing

388
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:14,590
where you add any kind of like extra

389
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:17,139
paragraph in its copy that you give to

390
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,959
for example if you have a committee you

391
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:23,110
give each and every one a sort of copy

392
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,929
of the same document with you add one

393
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,149
extra paragraph so if one copy ever

394
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,470
leaks you can actually find out we gave

395
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,178
it to and then that must have been

396
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:37,899
actually the suspects of the person

397
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:42,039
leaking it that's sort of hard to I

398
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:43,928
guess protect against then you I guess

399
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,710
you can protect against it by you know

400
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:49,059
maybe not actually publishing the full

401
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,159
document bits of quoting from it but

402
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,379
that sort of might have actually harmed

403
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:56,919
the reporting on it and at first

404
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:00,850
worthiness of this so that's sort of up

405
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,980
to the editors unlike how to you know

406
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:06,279
how do you balance their reporting out

407
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,529
with stuff like that then there's this

408
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:12,130
thing called zero with characters where

409
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:14,110
if you were sort of solving invisible to

410
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:17,919
the eye but if you would copy it from a

411
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:20,020
document you can sort of see it and

412
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,809
normally you know if you would happy

413
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,580
that you another editor it will not

414
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:27,250
appear but if you would actually copy it

415
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,379
to you know something like a terminal

416
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,820
you can actually see that it adds like

417
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:36,100
you can sort of copy it was it will sort

418
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,720
of look like you know here I have like a

419
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,469
conversion of fresh data but before

420
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,120
analyzing and within that same sentence

421
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,539
you know another sentries would appear

422
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,189
like oh is actually like you know Jane

423
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:51,979
Doe who has leaked the documents

424
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,749
and then you know there's the conversion

425
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:59,599
of fresh data before analyzing that we I

426
00:25:53,749 --> 00:26:01,820
forget in large quantities then you have

427
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:05,389
stuff like events in Kazakhstan

428
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:08,389
so Kazakhstan did this weird man in the

429
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:11,899
Middle where people would get men in the

430
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:14,719
middle and they will be asked on mobile

431
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:21,129
providers with text messages to install

432
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:24,950
this CA system so if they would go to

433
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:26,988
like you know facebook.com then it would

434
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,419
appear as if you know it's a CVPs but

435
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:30,830
they had installed the CA so Kentucky

436
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:35,269
State was actually met in the middling

437
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:37,549
it apparently it's been on hold for now

438
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:41,239
as they've been saying that it was a

439
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:48,710
sort of like successful pilots thing

440
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:50,539
that I did I'm not entirely convinced

441
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:55,899
it's gone

442
00:26:50,539 --> 00:27:00,139
I think what's been happening is that

443
00:26:55,899 --> 00:27:02,389
they do not have enough equipment to do

444
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:06,008
the man in the middle for the entire

445
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:10,758
country or even to process the data and

446
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:14,570
it seems that there's been providers

447
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:19,369
buying like 1440 gates products to make

448
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:23,689
this possible this the provider I think

449
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:26,689
of that was beeline in Kazakhstan so I

450
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,489
think there's a bunch of people just

451
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,289
buying a bunch of equipments and then

452
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:32,239
they're gonna up their processing power

453
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:36,080
of this system and I think it's gonna

454
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:37,609
probably back in full swing maybe six

455
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,379
months or like a year from now on I

456
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:43,189
don't think this is the last we were

457
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:44,719
here from that and you know it will be

458
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,080
really interesting to know which

459
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,029
manufacturers are eating this behavior

460
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,359
as you know we have journalists in

461
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:55,369
Kazakhstan and we would really like to

462
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,090
know you know what the companies are

463
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:58,090
eating this

464
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:03,768
let me do a bunch of pen testing so we

465
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:05,480
do a burn some penetration testing of

466
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:09,559
new applications before actually

467
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,929
launching them that has to do also with

468
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:16,250
like if people make any kind of search

469
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:22,549
engine to deal with the information that

470
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:23,840
journalists can go through and we hope

471
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:26,509
to you know increase the amount of

472
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,299
penetration testing also commercially

473
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:34,070
when it comes to you know auditing

474
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:37,158
really lots stuff for example we have a

475
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,620
really big data search engine data that

476
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,289
also CR Peters org and it has like you

477
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,049
know a bunch of data on that on there I

478
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:46,070
would really like to keep it safe so

479
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:48,769
it's these sort of things that we'd like

480
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:55,970
to really protect against for falling

481
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:59,200
for being compromised just really so you

482
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:04,220
know in case you ever get compromised

483
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:07,789
there's a bunch of actors that are

484
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,879
targeting sort of the stuff in this fear

485
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,408
of like you know if you tend to

486
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:14,959
investigate troika laundromats you you

487
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:17,509
make interesting enemies and some of

488
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,360
these tried actors tend to reuse IPs for

489
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:23,899
domains for fishing when you point them

490
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,299
to so it's always sort of interesting to

491
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:29,149
look at like domains and IPS using the

492
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:33,559
past and see if they ever change IP

493
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:35,149
address or like sort of hosting

494
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:38,658
companies that they tend to go to all

495
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:41,508
the time so to you know

496
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:43,370
passive DNS and some other tricks you

497
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:48,289
can sort of maybe figure out attacks

498
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:51,229
before they actually happened as some of

499
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:53,480
these actors tend to you know register a

500
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,120
domain like six months before they

501
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,710
actually use it so there's a bit of time

502
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,258
before you can actually like you know

503
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,940
take some of it down or like if you

504
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:06,759
detect them revoke any kind of ssl

505
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:09,860
certificates I actually revoked

506
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,180
immensely revoke one certificates I

507
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,889
think a month ago that

508
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:18,560
targeting one of our journalists in like

509
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:21,380
there was impersonating a major u.s.

510
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,240
email provider and they took it down

511
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:27,740
within a couple hours so that was kind

512
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,450
of nice and then you know with that you

513
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,370
can monitor us as I saw certificates

514
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,100
with certificate transparency was this

515
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:36,110
kind of super useful I think another

516
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,850
really nice tool that I use a lot in

517
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:41,620
investigations like there's this passive

518
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:44,090
total they have like this youths like

519
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:47,810
resource of like terabytes and terabytes

520
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:49,550
of data where you could actually use a

521
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,560
domain that you can see like all the

522
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:55,370
sort of like voice that it went through

523
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,310
in the last couple years so I was I

524
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,500
think investigating a domain yesterday

525
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,950
you could sort of put it in and then you

526
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,440
could see that it changed ownership

527
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,630
three times or like somebody's just

528
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:13,370
updated the details to be I think like

529
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:15,740
actually a fake person and you know that

530
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,840
was just to a passive total where you

531
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,300
could do that so it's really nice I in

532
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,439
the community version you get like 20 or

533
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:27,110
25 free queries a day so I would

534
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,010
definitely if you want to have fun with

535
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:34,520
that check it out

536
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:36,650
and then collaboration so NGOs tend to

537
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,889
have the same kind of kind of enemies I

538
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:42,350
guess and so there's some collaboration

539
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,810
on info sharing about people getting

540
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,149
compromised or like if they're

541
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,760
compromising one specific kind of NGO

542
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,630
that does you know investigations in the

543
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,650
same kind of rearm

544
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:57,610
or sphere we tend to help each other out

545
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:00,590
with some collaboration and information

546
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:03,199
and then it's always good to have

547
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:08,240
friends who a lot better in Mobile

548
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,830
reversing than I am so it's been people

549
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,030
that we can actually poke and they will

550
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,370
actually help out with somehow we're

551
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,350
reversing every hour gets very

552
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,679
interesting samples that we sometimes

553
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,679
get

554
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:26,730
and some other solutions there's some

555
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:29,760
that work monitoring so there's some

556
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:32,580
network monitoring and so I guess this

557
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,620
will be interesting right so I guess in

558
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,929
most networks in like business networks

559
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,110
if you would use if you would ever see

560
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:42,120
tor I guess that's kind of sketchy for a

561
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:47,879
generalist newsroom like using toys not

562
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:50,459
very sketchy so you know you need to

563
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,250
adjust any kind of network monitoring

564
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,990
quite often as to sort of allow these

565
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:59,309
sort of things to actually go through

566
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:00,780
and not raise any sort of a long but

567
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:07,290
then you get maybe into the thing where

568
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:08,820
what happens if you know a transact were

569
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,559
actually launched there's a static

570
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,970
binary of Tor and then use it that to

571
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:17,580
actual trade a bunch of stuff so it's

572
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,900
sort of you know that's stuff that I'm

573
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,570
sort of battling with a little bit

574
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,900
sometimes and then we do a lot of

575
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:27,480
training with people with the generation

576
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,309
question but we also train training they

577
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,690
help there's people like how they could

578
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:34,730
help with like you know possible

579
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:37,500
reductions of documents or conversion or

580
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:40,020
how to detect phishing emails and train

581
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,330
them into giving us as much information

582
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,960
as possible so we can actually you know

583
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,550
Luke if it's either legit email or you

584
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,110
know the actual phishing email or

585
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,450
something like that

586
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:57,570
and all the collaborations as I was

587
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:58,590
speaking about so how can you help I'd

588
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,629
really love to connect with

589
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:04,309
technologists from around the world many

590
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:06,540
like Eastern Europe and Central Asia

591
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,710
there's a lot of interesting stuff

592
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,679
happening there for example with

593
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,149
Kazakhstan so if you never know any kind

594
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,510
of people there I would really love to

595
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:18,330
talk about them I guess also like anti

596
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,250
censorship publishing technologies so

597
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:23,639
even if we would publish any kind of

598
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,590
information it would be really nice if

599
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:30,090
it doesn't really go offline for a long

600
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:32,620
time you know if you are a president an

601
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,360
IT sakti more for the NGOs

602
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:38,770
laughter talked about you maybe do some

603
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:41,260
knowledge sharing or other stuff then

604
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:45,040
they got data most investigations start

605
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,720
with a leak as you might imagine and if

606
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,699
you have any other ideas I'm happy to

607
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,699
talk about them maybe not on camera but

608
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:59,530
then that's sort of my talk it's hard to

609
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,320
send us be very concrete about some of

610
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:06,400
the security stuff that you do as relief

611
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,770
in very interesting times but I'm happy

612
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,870
to answer any questions while I'm here

613
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,870
if any one has questions

614
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,679
[Applause]
