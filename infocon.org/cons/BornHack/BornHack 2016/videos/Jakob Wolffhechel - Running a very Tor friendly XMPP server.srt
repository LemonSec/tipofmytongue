00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:21,000
servers of within the Tor network give

that an applause to Jacob so hello

<font color="#CCCCCC">Bo knack for creating this space where</font>

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,690
we can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about stuff sharing ideas</font>

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,960
and technology and drink beers and have

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:44,010
fun so this talk will focus on how to

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,010
run a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sore friendly xmpp server and</font>

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the abstract that</font>

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the survey actually also enforces using</font>

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,949
OCR so you cannot use this without<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,410
oti encryption which probably most of

18
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,420
you already know what is the reason I in

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,768
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sochi is first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all to try to</font>

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect the users from to protect my</font>

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,979
users from from from sending clear text

22
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,560
messages out on the networks and but

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,539
secondly it's also because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's many</font>

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,479
people use XMPP service without

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,100
encryption and yeah this server forces

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,009
it so if you have a friend who uses

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,250
another xmpp server and doesn't use any

28
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,430
doesn't know she doesn't use XMPP f er

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,680
you will have to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk with your</font>

30
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,240
friend or switch to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another xmpp server</font>

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,150
yeah and that's the yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,009
reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do that so first i will run</font>

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,000
over first of all talk a little bit

34
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,070
about myself then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will then I will</font>

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how I set up the server how</font>

36
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:54,298
its ship our secured it and how I

37
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:56,310
patched the server and yes so my the

38
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,790
background is my name is Jacob I've had

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">an interest in securing systems since I</font>

40
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,619
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> up my first server on the internet</font>

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,560
and i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been using computers for the</font>

42
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,869
past 15 years or so and the first server

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,390
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up was an ftp server so that i</font>

44
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,030
could share mp3s with my friends and

45
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,369
and i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out i had to put firewalls</font>

46
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,410
on it and that stuff and I mean yeah so

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,410
the knowledge grew as I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

48
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,410
more stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and back in</font>

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:29,010
the day there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> program called icq</font>

50
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,329
that really blew my mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> I installed it</font>

51
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,980
and my friends installed it and

52
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,370
certainly we could talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other on</font>

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,869
online instead of picking up the phone

54
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,120
and people have been on the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

55
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,920
a for a longer time will say that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,310
was there before I secure but we were

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:52,200
just users not we weren't nerds who knew

58
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,239
how to use IRC so Isaac you was my first

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,959
experience with online communication and

60
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,150
it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice so some years ago</font>

61
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've read about this interesting project</font>

62
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,570
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> tor and I was very intrigued by</font>

63
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of using a network that to</font>

64
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,910
anonymize myself with some it was

65
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,340
suddenly very very easy to switch IPS I

66
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,040
mean switch identity and use another IP

67
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,400
that wasn't my own and it was also legal

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,590
I mean instead of using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this font</font>

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">configured proxies on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font>

70
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:30,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">get another IP address so we had a</font>

71
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:33,359
platform where we could get other IPS so

72
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,670
I also set up a tour server and let it

73
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,380
run for a few days then I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on</font>

74
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,929
IRC and I was paying from all the

75
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,750
networks because I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

76
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,530
exit node so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had put up an exit known</font>

77
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:50,100
instead of a relay and other people were

78
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,440
using my IP for 1st off on IRC so I took

79
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,459
down the server switch my IP and then

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,950
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I configure it is a real a instead</font>

81
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,810
of an exit known so always for remember

82
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,350
to read the documentation before I put

83
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:09,299
something on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so that was</font>

84
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,280
yeah icic<font color="#E5E5E5"> queue and tour then windows</font>

85
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,500
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking to my friends on</font>

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,810
icq then windows came along with the

87
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,700
messenger platform was really really

88
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,329
easy to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody switch to</font>

89
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,890
messenger instead of icq and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

90
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,770
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to keep private</font>

91
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,539
communications with instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

92
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,139
delivering it through the Microsoft

93
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,878
Network and there was a third party in

94
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,889
friends I forget what the company is

95
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:37,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">called but there they had an encryption</font>

96
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:40,819
lay on top of messenger called sip SI MP

97
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:48,530
that we could use to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> privately with</font>

98
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:50,840
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really liked it that that we could</font>

99
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,210
talk privately and that was my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

100
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,849
experience talking securely on the

101
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of just yeah clear text</font>

102
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:02,479
messaging then<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook came along and</font>

103
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,819
certainly all my friends who had forced

104
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you sip they started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using facebook</font>

105
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:10,340
instead facebook chat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found out</font>

106
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the facebook chat used an open</font>

107
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,770
protocol called XMPP and that piqued<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

108
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:18,139
interest so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read about it and found</font>

109
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,030
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could use another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client I</font>

110
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,610
didn't use to I didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

111
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:26,628
web interface to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to people so i</font>

112
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:29,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">installed pigeon and yeah pigeon had</font>

113
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:32,810
this actually I called OTR off the

114
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:35,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">record that I could use instead of ship</font>

115
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,610
for Mason just so that's that's that's

116
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,159
what I use so many of me and my friends

117
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:47,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">we used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and and talked</font>

118
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:49,699
anonymously or privately using OCR so

119
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,069
the reasons why we did this was

120
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:56,120
communicating privately with friends and

121
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:59,659
well Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their changed their</font>

122
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,169
XMPP implementation to not it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

123
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:05,599
hard to use pidgin and other clients on

124
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">a you can use them again on facebook now</font>

125
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:14,150
but at that point you couldn't use them

126
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:17,120
and so Jabba<font color="#CCCCCC"> ccc 30 is a very well-known</font>

127
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,758
xmpp server many people use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but their</font>

128
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,860
sign of is always down or the capture is

129
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,270
failing and also it's a single point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

130
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:28,340
failure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I set up my own xmpp server</font>

131
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,830
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have more</font>

132
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:36,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">services so when one goes down we'll</font>

133
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:40,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">have another so</font>

134
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had some security considerations using</font>

135
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,890
us setting up this server and I have a I

136
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,920
have a server in Germany which is a

137
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:52,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">dedicated server it's not a VPS so it's</font>

138
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:55,210
it's it's own server so I've tried to

139
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:01,180
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it says locked down</font>

140
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:04,000
as possible so I've tried to set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

141
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,010
as as securely as i can so it's it's a

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,250
dedicated server and it has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports</font>

143
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,070
like USB and firewire disabled on it and

144
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also run a script on it that when</font>

145
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,230
we're changes happen to the server it'll

146
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,440
it'll lock down so if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulls the</font>

147
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,960
network cable and and puts it into

148
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,890
another switch my server will lock down

149
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also use full disk encryption on the</font>

150
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,840
server so that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if someone</font>

151
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,450
takes out the hard drive they only get

152
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,520
gibberish but I think you all know this

153
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:42,159
and also the cloak DK services are

154
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,799
running inside a jail set up on the

155
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:51,250
freebsd machine which it runs it runs

156
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:54,610
freebsd so yeah you can see everyone

157
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've run quite a few different services</font>

158
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,520
on it or jails on my server like these

159
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:06,700
are number 38<font color="#CCCCCC"> 241 I think I run around</font>

160
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:10,930
65 different services on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server yes</font>

161
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:13,270
my philosophy is to have one service /

162
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,360
jail it's a that's it's a it's a nice

163
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,719
way to do it so so if you have like a

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,120
sequel server that's one erable it'll it

165
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,150
you I mean it'll be difficult to jump

166
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">from one service to another and get the</font>

167
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:32,260
like get user information from from the

168
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:39,070
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to to use in another service</font>

169
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:42,880
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use the latest version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of openssl</font>

170
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:46,420
always because there's been so many

171
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,920
attacks on openssl recently so I make

172
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,529
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list and</font>

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,709
whenever

174
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:55,430
patches is created for something I used

175
00:08:51,709 --> 00:09:00,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I use something called putria</font>

176
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:02,300
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> package system so it'll it'll</font>

177
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,689
build all the packages for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

178
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,089
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually only need to to to look</font>

179
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:11,269
at the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

180
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:13,399
there's a new package for openssl i'll

181
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:19,759
just say install that page and boom it's

182
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:24,079
already created and also the server uses

183
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:28,160
self-signed certificate because yeah I

184
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:31,819
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the money to to buy from from</font>

185
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:35,930
a CA so and it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it doesn't</font>

186
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:38,360
really matter because yes it doesn't

187
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">really matter and I mean forward going</font>

188
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,269
maybe i'll use let's encrypt but i

189
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:46,969
haven't set that up yet so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how i</font>

190
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:54,230
create the soil it's a pretty it's a

191
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:56,509
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a es 256 and with 4096 bit so yeah</font>

192
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:03,290
it's just a script i use boom then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

193
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:05,990
have my<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate certificate some</font>

194
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,180
more security considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

195
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,339
I've disabled USB and firewire that's

196
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,489
also there's always an attack vector

197
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:15,290
using ILO which is a separate computer

198
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,389
running on the on the server that you

199
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use for management I mean you can</font>

200
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:24,559
you can use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and also the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

201
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,160
server is located in Germany not in

202
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,199
Denmark which means that it's not under

203
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,540
a Danish law which I would really really

204
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:36,258
like and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always on so even though</font>

205
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,949
if I use even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use full disk</font>

206
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:43,879
encryption the keys are all in memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

207
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:46,670
if someone attacks it in some way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

208
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:48,620
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out maybe they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font>

209
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,990
the keys in memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> too I mean that the</font>

210
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,019
file system is not encrypted more it

211
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,670
needs to be shut down for it further<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

212
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,910
the full disk encryption to actually

213
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,910
work

214
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:08,509
cloak the cloak xmpp server uses is it

215
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,790
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called prosody there are</font>

216
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">many different service but prosody is</font>

217
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:17,180
the one I use because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> had two modules</font>

218
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:20,300
that I really needed onion smart and the

219
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,399
onions mud and the OTR mod so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

220
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> written in Lua I don't know lure</font>

221
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,949
very well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Liu is easy to read and</font>

222
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,290
especially their the modules are very

223
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:35,660
small and very easy to sort of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

224
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:37,910
what code is in is in them and both mod

225
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,689
onions and mod OTR part of their

226
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,459
official prosody packages of modules so

227
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:50,569
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on the official</font>

228
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:54,229
website so the and it's also it's set up

229
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:56,300
with two virtual servers so you can

230
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:59,329
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign up to cloak DK you'll get a</font>

231
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,519
username at cloak decay or you can use a

232
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:05,420
username at the onion<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that it</font>

233
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">also has so you mean yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a very</font>

234
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">long name very very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

235
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,339
pronounce but if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want an</font>

236
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,199
onion user you can get one and for all

237
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,269
intents and purposes it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

238
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,060
server I mean if you have a cloak decay

239
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:23,209
you say you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people who</font>

240
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,300
are using other onion XMPP service and

241
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:28,518
if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the onion so ever you</font>

242
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,758
can still talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are not</font>

243
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:36,110
using onion xmpp server so if you have a

244
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:39,290
friend who's on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> java ccc XMPP you</font>

245
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,949
can even still talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy and</font>

246
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">Model T I set up this way as I said</font>

247
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:49,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">before I enforce using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LG on the server</font>

248
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:51,589
if you use it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't use OCR on</font>

249
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,300
your client<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll you can't it'll it'll</font>

250
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:54,889
warn you cloak the cables send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

251
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,920
message to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that you're talking</font>

252
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:01,430
unencrypted and that's but you can still

253
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,079
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out clear text messages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

254
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,849
friend so that's why I want the server

255
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,579
to be in Denmark instead of Germany

256
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,980
because it'll cross a lot of networks

257
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,589
and I mean most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who use it I</font>

258
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,040
think

259
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:21,870
are in Denmark anyway so yeah that would

260
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:26,219
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be best wait ok I've</font>

261
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:29,940
that's one slide Mason but and there's a

262
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:34,350
slight missing for mod onion but the

263
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:40,770
onion server as I the onion server it

264
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:43,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses the the cloaked or Tintin 10 jail</font>

265
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,650
for for communicating so it has its own

266
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:49,380
tour client running that talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

267
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,170
rest of the Tor network and of course

268
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:57,750
I've set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the the onion insight that</font>

269
00:13:52,170 --> 00:14:00,030
hidden service for it inside that I

270
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,950
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a live demonstration of</font>

271
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,140
how you can sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the through the</font>

272
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,550
fit to the service but I can't really do

273
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,240
that because I don't have the right

274
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:12,810
cable for for showing it it's on this so

275
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,320
it's on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer and the future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

276
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,150
cloak the case as a dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> server in</font>

277
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Denmark so if anyone has access to a</font>

278
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:23,579
data center i would really like to talk

279
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i would also like to</font>

280
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,360
have a dedicated server<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for cloak</font>

281
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:32,400
decay because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i run a lot of other</font>

282
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,980
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it and it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to</font>
